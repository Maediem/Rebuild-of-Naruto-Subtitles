1
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:26,026
You dodge well...

2
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:31,906
I'm the slowest attacker in the Akatsuki.

3
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:34,242
I can't seem to hit a thing, can I?

4
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:39,998
I see... So you're from the Akatsuki.

5
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,585
Well, you're pretty good.

6
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:44,961
Hey, Hidan.

7
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:51,342
She's the Two-Tails Jinchuriki.
You'll die if you get careless.

8
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:54,137
Don't give me that, Kakuzu!

9
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:57,682
I'd like her to kill me anyway.

10
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:01,895
Let's do this.

11
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,104
Hold it.

12
00:01:03,678 --> 00:01:05,054
Before doing that...

13
00:01:05,261 --> 00:01:08,389
I must pray to my God.

14
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:13,073
You’re always nothing but trouble.

15
00:01:13,285 --> 00:01:15,245
Even I think it's a pain.

16
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:18,374
However, the commandments are strict,
so I have no choice, do I?!

17
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:25,126
You probably think
you've got me cornered...

18
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:26,795
But you don't.

19
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,507
I'm the one who lured you here!

20
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,356
Now that I know you're with the Akatsuki,

21
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,817
I cannot let you escape.

22
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:53,780
Oh, man...
We're trapped, Kakuzu...

23
00:01:54,426 --> 00:01:57,513
No problem.
Actually, this is favorable for us.

24
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,811
I am Yugito Nii of the Hidden Cloud...

25
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:02,747
and I'll kill you!

26
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,749
Huh...? What?

27
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,793
What's with this "I'll kill you," act?

28
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:11,005
When people show me all
that enthusiasm and stuff...

29
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,715
I start to get irritated.

30
00:02:13,262 --> 00:02:16,390
And when I'm irritated, I become enraged.

31
00:02:16,415 --> 00:02:17,932
And when I become enraged...

32
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,825
Shut up, Hidan.

33
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,455
Okay. okay...

34
00:02:22,102 --> 00:02:24,896
But you know, when I become enraged,

35
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,354
I start feeling like,

36
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:29,841
"I don't care about our objective.
I just want to smash everything."

37
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:33,987
Knock it off, Hidan.
The objective is absolute.

38
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:38,533
This mission doesn't go along
with my religion in the first place.

39
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:41,881
The doctrine of Jashinism is
total slaughter.

40
00:02:41,934 --> 00:02:45,229
Leaving people alive goes
against the commandments.

41
00:02:45,794 --> 00:02:47,729
From the outset,

42
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:51,262
I'm not inclined to take part in a
mission that breaks the commandments.

43
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,632
I may not look it,
but I'm quite devout!

44
00:02:54,932 --> 00:02:58,310
So not being able to kill
is a pain in the neck.

45
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,348
How about we just talk this out?

46
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,392
Talk this out, you say?

47
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,478
Why don't you just come quietly?

48
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,256
Stop messing around!

49
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,478
Huh...? Looks like that's a no.

50
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:14,029
Are you an idiot?

51
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,750
Come on. Are you kidding me?

52
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,540
What's up with this Jinchuriki?

53
00:03:35,062 --> 00:03:37,315
She's completely transformed
into her Tailed Beast.

54
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,556
Oh man...

55
00:03:45,602 --> 00:03:46,333
Uh-oh!

56
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,401
Hot!

57
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:58,905
Don't cats have sensitive tongues
for hot stuff?

58
00:04:01,082 --> 00:04:04,994
So this is the Two-Tails monster cat
known as the Wraith.

59
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:08,873
And I'm a rat in a cage, no less.

60
00:04:10,002 --> 00:04:11,159
This is not amusing...

61
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,973
In order to have others quickly
understand you...

62
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:53,269
first, you must get closer
to their spirits.

63
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:56,314
For example, when calling people
by their names,

64
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:59,859
It's too impersonal to add "-san"
or "-kun" to someone's name.

65
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,236
You will never get closer
to them like that.

66
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,697
You might first try taking the plunge

67
00:06:04,722 --> 00:06:07,141
and call people by
their first name only...

68
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:10,044
or try using a nickname or
term of endearment.

69
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:14,499
If you do that, others will feel
much closer to you...

70
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,292
as a special person...

71
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,169
I get it...

72
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,591
Oh, found it.

73
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,096
<i>What...? Isn't that Sai?</i>

74
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,723
Make-Out Paradise is...

75
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,809
Did you come looking for a book
of paintings or something?

76
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,268
Sakura...

77
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,981
So, you read books, huh...?

78
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,943
Well... a little bit.

79
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,367
<i>So even Sai has quite
a human side to him, huh...?</i>

80
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,495
Naruto and I were just on our way

81
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,414
to visit Kakashi-sensei
in the hospital...

82
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,833
Why don't you come with us?

83
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,002
Kakashi... Sensei...

84
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:04,674
You're on Team Kakashi too,
so you should meet him...

85
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:12,890
Naruto!

86
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,603
What? Sai's with you, too?

87
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,981
I bumped into him at the library.

88
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:24,110
Oh... and here I was working out
my plan to walk with you,

89
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,571
just the two of us,
like we were on a date!

90
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,489
If you've got the time to be
doing that,

91
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,533
you should be studying up
on ninjutsu or something!

92
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,618
Study, huh...?

93
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,289
How can you guys even go to
a stuffy place like that?

94
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:41,794
Naruto, it would be better if you trained
your head a little and not just your body.

95
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,255
Because you truly are an idiot.

96
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:49,010
<i>I knew it... Sakura is calling
Naruto only by his first name...</i>

97
00:07:49,491 --> 00:07:52,744
That's harsh, Sakura.

98
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,602
N-Naruto, S-Sakura...

99
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,899
Could you guys include me
in the conversation, too?

100
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:08,404
Oh! Well, I read in a book...

101
00:08:08,429 --> 00:08:10,514
about how to open up to
other people right away...

102
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:14,327
And in the book, it said to call people
by their first names only

103
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,204
and to use nicknames and
terms of endearment...

104
00:08:16,665 --> 00:08:19,000
It said if I did that there would
be a sense of friendliness

105
00:08:19,025 --> 00:08:20,860
and we'd be able
to get along right away.

106
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:27,256
Oh, so you're concerned
about stuff like that, huh?

107
00:08:27,756 --> 00:08:29,632
So that's what you were doing
in the library...

108
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,220
Yeah.

109
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,722
And... I was thinking about nicknames

110
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,516
and terms of endearment
for you guys...

111
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,268
But I couldn't really come up
with anything good...

112
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,854
So I'll just call you guys by
just your first names for now...

113
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,482
You don't need to think about stuff
like that.

114
00:08:44,507 --> 00:08:46,509
It just happens naturally!

115
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,819
For nicknames or terms of endearment,

116
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,988
You should just use one
of their defining traits.

117
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,783
For example,
if you're talking about Naruto...

118
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,537
Like "Idiot Naruto" or "Moron Naruto"!

119
00:08:57,562 --> 00:09:00,857
Sakura, you're taking things
too far with that.

120
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,669
<i>I get it... A person's character trait...</i>

121
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,173
<i>I can't believe this is Sai...</i>

122
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,509
<i>He's totally different from
when I first met him...</i>

123
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,393
Thank you. I've got
the hang of it now...

124
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:22,216
Ugly.

125
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,733
Sai, you're really taking things
too far with that!

126
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,402
Huh? What do you mean?

127
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,614
Sakura, why'd you have to
hit me, too...?

128
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,204
I see... You're the new team member.

129
00:09:40,527 --> 00:09:42,362
Sai, was it? Nice to meet you.

130
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,709
Right.

131
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,588
Kakashi-sensei...
About our previous mission...

132
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,048
I heard about everything
from Yamato.

133
00:09:52,135 --> 00:09:53,470
About Sasuke, too...

134
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,141
We don't have time...

135
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,311
At this rate, he'll soon be...

136
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:08,733
But I can't bring Sasuke back
with the power I have now...

137
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,235
He's gotten too powerful...

138
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:16,490
Well then, you just have to get
more powerful, right?

139
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:24,123
But... the speed of Sasuke's development
was extraordinary even in my eyes.

140
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,542
When I asked Lady Tsunade,

141
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:29,253
she said there's a possibility
they're using Forbidden Jutsu

142
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,713
and perhaps drugs in his training...

143
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,799
And they've got Kabuto with them, so...

144
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:37,136
There's probably no way to find out,
in a book like this,

145
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,472
how people who conduct
experiments on humans think...

146
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:44,810
Then we just have to
rapidly get more powerful.

147
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,481
But how do we do that?

148
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:51,275
Did you think I was just lying here
not thinking about anything?

149
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,736
I thought about that the whole time.

150
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,030
And... I figured it out.

151
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,952
However, this approach is
suited for Naruto...

152
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:08,084
Or rather, it's a method only
Naruto can use.

153
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,836
With this training...

154
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:14,965
You might even surpass me, Naruto.

155
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:19,199
I'll... surpass you, Kakashi-sensei?

156
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:20,513
That's right.

157
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,557
I'll be with you the whole time
on this training.

158
00:11:24,582 --> 00:11:27,710
And it will be a different
type of training...

159
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,212
Wh-What are we going to do...?

160
00:11:31,903 --> 00:11:34,698
We're going to create an
ultimate ninjutsu just for you.

161
00:11:36,516 --> 00:11:37,351
In other words,

162
00:11:37,376 --> 00:11:40,421
you're going to learn a new ninjutsu
that will exceed the Rasengan.

163
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:44,537
However, the acquisition
of such a power

164
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:47,915
will require an enormous amount
of time and effort.

165
00:11:48,668 --> 00:11:50,420
An enormous amount of time...

166
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:55,133
But I just said we don't have time!
Sasuke will be...

167
00:11:55,158 --> 00:11:59,412
What I'm saying is, I figured out a way
to do it in a short amount of time.

168
00:12:02,236 --> 00:12:03,153
How do we do it...?

169
00:12:03,282 --> 00:12:04,283
Well...

170
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:06,563
How're you doing, Kakashi?

171
00:12:07,063 --> 00:12:10,150
Asuma-sensei, you could
at least knock!

172
00:12:10,358 --> 00:12:11,359
Hello.

173
00:12:13,798 --> 00:12:16,426
Oh, it's Naruto and Sakura...

174
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,320
Is your mission already...

175
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,777
You're that guy from back then...

176
00:12:26,937 --> 00:12:28,105
Wh-Who is he...?

177
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,417
<i>Why is all of this happening
so suddenly today...?</i>

178
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,754
<i>Relax. First, smile...</i>

179
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:37,028
Hello.

180
00:12:41,964 --> 00:12:44,967
Oh, so that's what was going on.

181
00:12:45,287 --> 00:12:46,789
I buy that.

182
00:12:48,015 --> 00:12:51,268
My name's Sai.
Please just call me by my first name.

183
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:57,147
Hey, he's pretty cute...
He kind of resembles Sasuke, too.

184
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:01,197
On the outside.
But he's quite different on the inside.

185
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,178
He's not very good at reading the room.

186
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,963
I heard about Sasuke from Lady Tsunade.

187
00:13:08,265 --> 00:13:11,393
I'll help you guys out in the future
should something happen.

188
00:13:11,713 --> 00:13:14,174
I'm finished with those troublesome
Chunin Exams, after all.

189
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,329
You missed out on becoming
a Chunin again, huh?

190
00:13:20,461 --> 00:13:21,462
Yeah...

191
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:26,363
Well, I guess that was the least
of your problems, huh...?

192
00:13:29,735 --> 00:13:32,863
What are you doing here
with the whole gang in town?

193
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,205
This isn't a break room, you know.

194
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:36,650
That's right...

195
00:13:36,987 --> 00:13:39,740
You guys go on ahead to the barbecue.

196
00:13:40,392 --> 00:13:43,311
You guys from Team Kakashi
should go too if you want.

197
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,783
Yay! Barbecue!

198
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,243
I second that!

199
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,996
<i>I'll sit next to Sai!</i>

200
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,335
I need to talk to Kakashi alone
about a few things.

201
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,088
The barbecue is on me, okay?

202
00:14:00,251 --> 00:14:01,961
Hey, just a minute!

203
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,425
Listen! Listen!

204
00:14:03,637 --> 00:14:07,516
What about the rest of the discussion
about my training?!

205
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,080
That's right... Hmm...

206
00:14:11,827 --> 00:14:13,287
Well, we'll get to that later.

207
00:14:13,348 --> 00:14:17,019
Later?! I'm really curious about it!

208
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,957
Well, we can't start training while
I'm still in the hospital.

209
00:14:21,622 --> 00:14:22,737
Don't be so impatient.

210
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,663
What a nice day.

211
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,875
Hm? Yeah... it is.

212
00:14:37,636 --> 00:14:40,806
Naruto and Sakura are
coming along very well.

213
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:44,499
And so are Shikamaru,
Choji and Ino...

214
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,988
The next generation is
growing up quickly.

215
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,890
They'll overtake us just like that...

216
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:54,894
Come on.
I still won't be giving in to them.

217
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:01,275
But this is something the Hidden Leaf
should be very pleased about.

218
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,030
So...

219
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,490
What did you want to talk about?

220
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,702
Hm? Oh, as it happens...

221
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,540
There you are...
I finally found you.

222
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:20,085
Kurenai...
Did you need something?

223
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,421
I heard Asuma was here, you see...

224
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:25,925
No kidding...?

225
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,178
So, Asuma...
What did you want to talk about?

226
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:36,852
Uh, I'll tell you later... Sorry.

227
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,070
<i>Now I really want to know...</i>

228
00:15:51,374 --> 00:15:52,917
What took you so long, Sakura?

229
00:15:53,573 --> 00:15:55,116
What? Where's Shikamaru?

230
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:56,678
He said he was going home

231
00:15:56,703 --> 00:16:00,626
to help his father to collect
deer antlers for medecine.

232
00:16:01,032 --> 00:16:02,450
No kidding?

233
00:16:02,902 --> 00:16:06,948
He always shows up
for end-of-mission parties...

234
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,418
This is a first for him...

235
00:16:08,997 --> 00:16:11,041
<i>She isn't taking my advice...</i>

236
00:16:11,243 --> 00:16:14,580
All right! I'll eat Shikamaru's share!

237
00:16:14,704 --> 00:16:15,705
Hey, Choji!

238
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:20,980
We have to introduce ourselves
to Sai before we eat.

239
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,273
Oh, oh... right.

240
00:16:23,812 --> 00:16:24,813
Hi...

241
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:29,238
<i>First meetings are very important
in order to quickly open up to people...</i>

242
00:16:29,816 --> 00:16:32,444
<i>I have to decide on nicknames
and terms of endearment right away...</i>

243
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:36,581
Uh, I'm Choji Akimichi
of the Akimichi Clan.

244
00:16:36,869 --> 00:16:39,788
Nice to meet you.
Uh, you're Sai, right?

245
00:16:40,403 --> 00:16:42,364
Nice to meet you... uh...

246
00:16:42,813 --> 00:16:44,356
<i>Character trait... character trait...</i>

247
00:16:45,203 --> 00:16:46,204
<i>Don't tell me...</i>

248
00:16:46,745 --> 00:16:48,455
<i>He's not going to say
that taboo word, is he?!</i>

249
00:16:49,073 --> 00:16:50,074
Fa...

250
00:16:52,408 --> 00:16:57,538
Sai! The word "fatty" is absolutely
forbidden around Choji! Got it?!

251
00:16:58,033 --> 00:17:00,344
Did he... start to say something just now?

252
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:02,552
No, it's nothing...

253
00:17:02,577 --> 00:17:03,578
I see.

254
00:17:06,511 --> 00:17:08,471
<i>It sure is tough coming up
with nicknames...</i>

255
00:17:09,956 --> 00:17:12,542
My name's Ino Yamanaka.

256
00:17:12,571 --> 00:17:14,489
My family owns
the Yamanaka Flower Shop.

257
00:17:14,514 --> 00:17:15,807
Nice to meet you.

258
00:17:18,595 --> 00:17:20,013
<i>In the case of a girl,</i>

259
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:22,874
<i>saying a character trait
just makes them angry...</i>

260
00:17:24,347 --> 00:17:28,768
<i>In other words, if I say the opposite...</i>

261
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:34,515
Nice to meet you... beautiful.

262
00:17:41,609 --> 00:17:44,070
Why do you say that
when it's Ino?!

263
00:17:46,638 --> 00:17:48,807
Stop it, Sakura!

264
00:18:23,124 --> 00:18:26,461
It's already been thirty minutes.
Aren't you done yet, Hidan?

265
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:29,338
Shut up!
Don't interfere with the ritual!

266
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,444
Ouch...

267
00:18:34,512 --> 00:18:37,473
Can't you skip some of that

268
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,785
perverse praying
you do each and every time?

269
00:18:40,032 --> 00:18:41,533
Let's get right to the next one.

270
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,040
This is a pain in the neck for me too.

271
00:18:44,065 --> 00:18:46,151
But I have no choice
but to follow the commandments.

272
00:18:46,787 --> 00:18:49,122
And what do you mean by skip?!

273
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,713
That's blasphemy against God!

274
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,220
One more to go for our mission.

275
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,351
One by one...

276
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,188
Next is the Land of Fire.

277
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,071
Zetsu, huh?

278
00:19:16,637 --> 00:19:19,348
<i>It appears it's done.</i>

279
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:22,703
<i>Finally finished with
your drawn-out ritual, huh?</i>

280
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:29,334
Nothing but annoying atheist jerks
who don't understand prayer!

281
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,477
When you're sad and alone,

282
00:19:32,501 --> 00:19:35,757
<i>you can only trust in yourself.</i>

283
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,801
No, you're wrong.

284
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:41,075
You can only trust in money.

285
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,476
Oh, here we go!

286
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,392
We've fallen behind with
our Jinchuriki hunt

287
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,728
mostly because of your side job!

288
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,900
I teamed up with you because
you said religion is profitable.

289
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:55,360
I've been left in charge
of Akatsuki finances.

290
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,862
Put yourself in my shoes.

291
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,781
Money is important.

292
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:03,827
<i>More importantly,
search for the next one immediately.</i>

293
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,955
<i>I'll take care of the Two-Tails...</i>

294
00:20:09,995 --> 00:20:12,289
How deep into the mountains is it?

295
00:20:12,443 --> 00:20:13,653
We're almost there.

296
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:16,696
You've been saying that
the whole time!

297
00:20:19,569 --> 00:20:23,073
Come on. Give me a break!
We've got to climb again?!

298
00:20:23,371 --> 00:20:26,207
What if it turns out
there's no Jinchuriki?!

299
00:20:26,232 --> 00:20:27,650
I'll be really upset!

300
00:20:28,124 --> 00:20:32,795
I don't give a damn about you.
If you keep wailing like a little kid...

301
00:20:34,204 --> 00:20:35,330
I'll kill you.

302
00:20:35,794 --> 00:20:39,756
Come on.
Don't give me that, Kakuzu!

303
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:45,410
Oh, man!
What an anti-social jerk.

304
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:53,502
This is a temple.
Is there a Jinchuriki in a place like this?

305
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,795
Who knows?

306
00:20:55,379 --> 00:21:00,592
But this isn't an ordinary temple,
so there's a good possibility.

307
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:15,524
What was that?!

308
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,609
Someone destroyed the Iron Wall Seal!

309
00:21:17,634 --> 00:21:19,386
Report this to Lord Chiriku!

310
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:25,075
It doesn't look like these guys
want to convert to Jashinism.

311
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,851
None of these guys do...

312
00:21:27,824 --> 00:21:30,660
That cloak... It's the rumored...

313
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:33,000
No doubt about it! It's the Akatsuki!

314
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:38,964
We have intruders!

315
00:21:39,118 --> 00:21:40,286
Who are they?

316
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,551
They are with the Akatsuki!

317
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,388
<i>I knew they'd come here eventually, but...</i>

318
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,891
I'll go!
Everyone else provide backup.

319
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,864
Looks like we've got another
virtuous looking one...

320
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,699
He's not just virtuous.

321
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:11,163
He's got a 30 million-ryo bounty
on his head in our Bingo Book.

322
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:17,002
Hey...
You're not after money, are you?

323
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:20,297
You'll go to hell if you kill
a monk for something like that.

324
00:22:20,446 --> 00:22:24,909
Money is the key that opens all doors.
That's just what I want.

325
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:29,431
I don't know what you guys want.
But please leave quietly.

326
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,476
No meaningless slaughter, huh?

327
00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:35,745
But it doesn't work like that
in my religion.

328
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:40,442
The Fire Temple is the greatest
shinobi temple in the Land of Fire.

329
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:44,697
And it is said that all the monks
control the special power

330
00:22:44,722 --> 00:22:46,640
known as the Gift of the Sages.

331
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,701
And the 30 million-ryo man is a ninja

332
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,954
who was once chosen as a member
of the Guardian Shinobi Twelve

333
00:22:52,979 --> 00:22:56,649
who protected the Feudal Lord
of the Land of Fire.

334
00:22:57,093 --> 00:23:01,472
And the proof is that sash with
the Land of Fire emblem on it.

335
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:05,008
No kidding? Is he that incredible?

336
00:23:05,226 --> 00:23:07,770
Don't get careless. You'll die.

337
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:11,264
Don't give me that...

338
00:23:11,878 --> 00:23:13,087
Kakuzu!

339
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,996
What's that?!

340
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:38,166
I don't care.
Let's keep going.

341
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:03,775
You're mine!

342
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:15,078
- Oh.
- Lord Chiriku won!

343
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:25,297
I'll give you a funeral.

344
00:24:26,182 --> 00:24:30,311
Who would accept
a different religion's funeral?

345
00:24:30,862 --> 00:24:33,823
I'd receive divine retribution
from Lord Jashin...

346
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:35,927
Now I'm mad...

347
00:24:35,952 --> 00:24:39,623
Hey...
If this guy isn't a Jinchuriki...

348
00:24:39,668 --> 00:24:43,297
I can defend my commandments, right?

349
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:49,156
Do as you like.
But his body is worth money.

350
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:53,867
Don't go overboard...
Make sure he's recognizable.

351
00:24:55,535 --> 00:25:00,394
Trading a life for money...
that's not what a person does.

352
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:01,670
Good grief.

353
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,127
Kakuzu! Stay out of this!

354
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:07,464
I'll take care of... this guy!

355
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:14,471
Chiriku of the Fire Temple will
not lose to wicked men like you!

356
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,596
<i>Raigo:</i>

357
00:25:18,621 --> 00:25:19,914
<i>A Thousand Hand Strike!</i>

358
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,776
Okay, time for some training.

359
00:25:30,019 --> 00:25:31,020
What is it?

360
00:25:31,801 --> 00:25:36,159
Well, it's been a long time
since I've trained with you...

361
00:25:36,342 --> 00:25:39,512
I don't really know why,
but I'm glad...

362
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:40,872
I see.

363
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,901
Laugh it up while you can.

364
00:25:48,396 --> 00:25:50,773
Time won't wait for us, so...

365
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,553
As I told you at the hospital,

366
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,889
the purpose of this training is
to create a ninjutsu

367
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,100
of ultimate power just for you.

368
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,061
A jutsu that will exceed
the Rasengan.

369
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,900
Two techniques,
"Change in Chakra Nature"

370
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,570
and "Change in Chakra Form,"
are crucial for that...

371
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:16,241
Change in chakra form
and change in... chakra nature?

372
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,369
Let's see...
Take Chidori for example...

373
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,750
This is a jutsu activated
by simultaneously creating

374
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,337
both the change in chakra nature
and change in chakra form...

375
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,882
Watch this. I concentrate
chakra in my right hand...

376
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:39,681
I change the nature of this chakra
to lightning.

377
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:44,102
So this is the change in chakra nature...

378
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:45,604
That's right.

379
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,814
And now I shift the form
so it will discharge electricity

380
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:51,301
and then I determine the range
and strength of the attack.

381
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:58,325
In order to learn a jutsu above
that of the Rasengan,

382
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:02,104
this combination of
the change in chakra form

383
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:06,291
and change in chakra nature is absolutely
necessary, like with the Chidori.

384
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:10,420
Then I'll be able to complete
a new jutsu in a flash

385
00:27:10,445 --> 00:27:15,658
if I add that change in chakra nature
to my Rasengan!

386
00:27:16,238 --> 00:27:19,408
Listen. That's easier said than done.

387
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:24,184
And you don't even know your own
chakra nature, do you?

388
00:27:24,661 --> 00:27:26,955
Huh?! What's a chakra nature?

389
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,859
Well, I figured I'd have to start
explaining from there...

390
00:27:33,931 --> 00:27:34,932
Listen up.

391
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:39,574
There are five basic chakra natures...

392
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:44,996
The five types are Fire, Wind,
Water, Lightning and Earth.

393
00:27:45,825 --> 00:27:47,785
These basic properties are the basis

394
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:50,605
for the names of the "Five Great Nations"

395
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,171
and they're also the foundations
of all ninjutsu.

396
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:56,091
No kidding. Really...?

397
00:27:56,841 --> 00:28:00,804
Everyone generally has chakra
that falls under one of these properties.

398
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:06,226
For example, the Uchiha clan
has the property of Fire,

399
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:08,587
and Fire Style jutsu is their strength.

400
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:13,817
Wind has the Wind Style.
And lightning has the Lightning Style.

401
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:17,654
Chidori is a Lightning Style jutsu.

402
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:23,977
So that means Sasuke has two natures:
Fire and Lightning?

403
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:26,498
And you currently don't have any.

404
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:31,459
Plus, we don't know your
natural chakra affinity.

405
00:28:32,372 --> 00:28:34,791
I'll find that out with
this strip of paper.

406
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:36,918
How are you going to do that...?

407
00:28:43,412 --> 00:28:46,498
The paper gets wrinkled if you have
a Lightning nature.

408
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,644
It'll get cut if it's Wind.

409
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,022
It'll burn if it's Fire.

410
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:55,859
It'll get wet if it's Water.

411
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,112
It'll crumble if it's Earth.

412
00:29:00,441 --> 00:29:03,152
This is litmus paper that reacts
easily to chakra.

413
00:29:03,751 --> 00:29:06,712
It's made from a special tree
that grows while absorbing chakra.

414
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,540
If you flow your chakra into this paper,

415
00:29:10,565 --> 00:29:12,692
you'll find out what your nature is.

416
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,131
All right...

417
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:29,684
Now I get the feeling...

418
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:33,271
I kind of understand what
you were talking about.

419
00:29:34,889 --> 00:29:38,946
I'm sorry I left the Hidden Leaf...
and just did whatever I wanted.

420
00:29:44,828 --> 00:29:46,872
I have no regrets, though.

421
00:29:56,586 --> 00:30:01,549
Now I feel like it wasn't so bad
being born into the Sarutobi Clan.

422
00:30:03,022 --> 00:30:06,776
You properly fulfilled your duty
as leader of the village...

423
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,897
You were a cool dad...

424
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,877
Your chakra nature is Wind.

425
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:40,296
<i>Wind...</i>

426
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:43,049
It tears and cuts through
all sorts of things.

427
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,510
It's chakra with
outstanding battle strength.

428
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,930
Ooh! I'm awesome!

429
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:52,350
No, you've still only just figured
out your property...

430
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:53,834
Now at last,

431
00:30:53,897 --> 00:30:57,342
we've come to the training for learning
the change in chakra nature for Wind...

432
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:58,363
Right!

433
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:03,903
However, it will take an enormous
amount of time to learn that technique.

434
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:10,923
And so I hit upon a way to
drastically reduce that time.

435
00:31:11,213 --> 00:31:12,214
Awesome!

436
00:31:12,664 --> 00:31:14,500
And the way to do that is...

437
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,334
Captain Yamato!

438
00:31:18,524 --> 00:31:20,275
Huh? Why, why?

439
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:25,091
Kakashi asked me to help out
with this training.

440
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:29,470
I'm sorry for interrupting you,
Kakashi-senpai...

441
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,139
No problem...

442
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,433
- And you see...
- Hey! Hey!

443
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,312
What type of change in chakra nature
is your Wood Style, Captain Yamato?

444
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,230
Huh?

445
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:41,858
Well...

446
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:44,652
Uh-huh...

447
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:46,149
Then...

448
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,324
<i>Earth Style: Rampart of Flowing Soil</i>

449
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,496
Whoa! What?!

450
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,416
<i>Water Style: Waterfall Basin Jutsu!</i>

451
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,174
He made a waterfall...

452
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:12,388
I have two chakra natures:
Earth and Water.

453
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:16,643
What?! You have two of them,
Captain Yamato?!

454
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:20,980
Jonin-class ninja generally
have two or more.

455
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,692
I've also got properties other
than Lightning that I can use.

456
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,153
Then, Captain Yamato has

457
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,822
three natures including the Wood Style?

458
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,076
No, that's not how it works.

459
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,118
Huh?

460
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:37,413
I can only use Earth and Water.

461
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:41,459
There is no fundamental nature
known as "Wood" to begin with.

462
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,878
Then how do you do it?

463
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,546
He does it simultaneously.

464
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:50,176
He does the change in chakra nature
for Earth and Water at the same time

465
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,887
and generates the new Wood nature.

466
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,014
Earth with my right hand...

467
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:57,016
and Water with my left hand.

468
00:33:07,213 --> 00:33:08,297
That's awesome...

469
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:12,240
If you have two chakra natures...

470
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:15,952
it's not that difficult to use
each one independently.

471
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:19,455
But when it comes to generating

472
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,791
two change in chakra natures
at the same time...

473
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,585
It's a different story...

474
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:28,840
The power to generate a
new chakra nature

475
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:31,634
by using two change in chakra natures
simultaneously

476
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,845
is called Kekkei Genkai.

477
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:37,265
You've at least heard of
that expression, haven't you?

478
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,114
Yeah...

479
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,520
That boy you once fought, Haku, used it.

480
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:47,900
He was able to use the Kekkei Genkai
known as the Ice Style...

481
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,404
But he generated "Ice" by using

482
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:54,348
the two change in chakra natures
of Wind and Water at the same time.

483
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:57,410
It's a special jutsu

484
00:33:57,435 --> 00:34:00,229
only those from a clan possessing
the Kekkei Genkai can use.

485
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:02,957
Haku, too, huh...?

486
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:07,628
So I couldn't copy it even with
my Sharingan...

487
00:34:10,718 --> 00:34:13,262
Then what about Shikamaru's
Shadow Possession Jutsu

488
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:15,289
or Choji's Expansion Jutsu?

489
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:20,099
And what about medical ninjutsu
and genjutsu?

490
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:21,642
Kakashi-senpai...

491
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:26,898
Why don't you save the Yin and Yang of
change in chakra nature for another time?

492
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:30,860
Yin? And Yang?
What's that?

493
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:32,820
Right.

494
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:35,615
You wouldn't understand even
if I told you now.

495
00:34:36,152 --> 00:34:38,696
Now, what were we talking about again?

496
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:43,998
Oh... Something about a shortcut
for my training time...

497
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,375
Reduce the time.

498
00:34:46,855 --> 00:34:49,608
Yeah, that. So, how do we do that?

499
00:34:50,144 --> 00:34:52,188
Multiple Shadow Clones.

500
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,091
Huh?

501
00:34:53,904 --> 00:34:54,905
Listen up...

502
00:34:55,644 --> 00:34:58,897
You know that the Shadow Clone Jutsu
doesn’t create illusions

503
00:34:58,922 --> 00:35:02,403
like the ordinary Clone Jutsu does, right?

504
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,561
Yeah, of course I do!

505
00:35:05,951 --> 00:35:09,747
Well, you can also call it a ninjutsu
for creating a copy of yourself.

506
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:14,512
I know because I can also use the Shadow
Clone Jutsu, though not to your extent.

507
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:19,242
There is a particular effect this
jutsu has on the caster.

508
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:24,080
And since you're always using it,
I'm sure you've picked up on this...

509
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:28,334
Anything experienced by
the shadow clone

510
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:32,463
is also experienced by the caster

511
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:35,508
after the clone has returned
to the original's body.

512
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:39,137
I knew you hadn't picked up on it.

513
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:42,890
I mean, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

514
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:47,436
Then let's both try
creating shadow clones.

515
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,689
Oh, one clone will be enough.

516
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:51,983
Right.

517
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,734
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

518
00:35:56,404 --> 00:36:01,117
All right! Now let's split up into
"original" and "shadow clone" teams...

519
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:06,831
The shadow clone team will
hide in the woods over there.

520
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,333
Come with me, shadow clone Naruto.

521
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,335
Right!

522
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,640
The originals can't see us shadow clones

523
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,726
here in the woods now.

524
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,688
Now, just the two of us will play
rock-paper-scissors.

525
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,731
What for?

526
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,316
Just do it.

527
00:36:37,351 --> 00:36:40,104
What are the shadow clones doing?

528
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,408
You'll find out soon.

529
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:45,536
Yes!

530
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:48,873
I won! You owe me a meal, Kakashi-sensei!

531
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:53,169
Okay, okay. Now we're going to
break the jutsu and vanish.

532
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:54,420
Right.

533
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,300
What were they doing?

534
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:03,512
You have to treat me to Ichiraku Ramen,
Kakashi-sensei!

535
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,556
I beat you at rock-paper-scissors!

536
00:37:06,228 --> 00:37:08,438
What are you doing, making promises
on my behalf?

537
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:10,563
Now you get it, right?

538
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,897
Shadow clone experiences

539
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:15,066
are accumulated within
the original's body.

540
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,610
I get it...

541
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,904
I never realized it at all
because I was just sort of using

542
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,906
the shadow clones
without really thinking about it.

543
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:26,160
Normally, this jutsu is used for
scouting dangerous locations

544
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:30,623
and gathering information by infiltrating
an enemy hideout, you see.

545
00:37:31,636 --> 00:37:34,085
But even having figured that out,

546
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:37,380
what does that have to do with
reducing the training time?

547
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:42,468
To put it a different way, it also means,
if you use two people,

548
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:45,471
it'll take half the time it takes
to train alone.

549
00:37:45,976 --> 00:37:48,562
And it'll take one-third
the time if you use three.

550
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:51,936
One-thousandth with a thousand.

551
00:37:52,362 --> 00:37:55,616
In other words, training that would
take two days alone

552
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:58,109
will take one day with two people.

553
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:01,324
Even training that would take
twenty years alone

554
00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:03,852
will take around a week with
a thousand people.

555
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:07,243
That's awesome!
So we can do it that way!

556
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,246
He finally got it, huh...?

557
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:14,041
Now I know why you're so strong,
Kakashi-sensei!

558
00:38:14,419 --> 00:38:17,172
So this is
how you did your training, huh?

559
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:21,882
No, I've never even once
trained using this approach.

560
00:38:21,907 --> 00:38:22,992
Huh?! Why not?

561
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:26,053
You can also make
shadow clones, can't you?

562
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:27,805
Indeed, I can...

563
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:31,600
But I don't have as much
chakra as you do.

564
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:34,437
And I can't sustain
my shadow clones as long, either.

565
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:39,275
And the only types
of jutsu suitable for me,

566
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,235
since I don't have much chakra,

567
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,404
are the ones requiring an
even distribution of chakra.

568
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:48,576
For real? I have more chakra than you,
Kakashi-sensei?

569
00:38:49,189 --> 00:38:51,024
You've got around four times
more than me.

570
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:56,001
Huh?! I've got that much?!
I'm pretty awesome, aren't I?!

571
00:38:56,136 --> 00:38:58,305
If you didn't suppress the power
of the Nine-Tails chakra,

572
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,087
you'd have around
a hundred times more.

573
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:04,675
That's why this is a training approach
only you can do.

574
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:09,430
But since it requires
a large amount of chakra,

575
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:12,516
there's a possibility of rousing
the Nine-Tails chakra.

576
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:18,731
And so I was summoned here in order
to control the Nine-Tails chakra.

577
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,069
I'm ready!

578
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:30,659
All right! First, you must train
to strengthen your chakra nature.

579
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,203
Right!

580
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:36,540
Sandwich a leaf between your palms
and cut it just with chakra.

581
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,168
Keep it there until you cut it right
in half, okay?

582
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,629
All right! Let's do this!

583
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,839
And as I said before,

584
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,717
you'll do this training with shadow clones
at all times.

585
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:50,137
How many clones should I make?

586
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:54,350
Well, if you take
one person for one leaf...

587
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:56,936
Maybe around that many.

588
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:58,562
Huh?!

589
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,321
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

590
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,568
<i>Already got a little cut in, huh?</i>

591
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:48,362
<i>This might be quicker than I thought.</i>

592
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:02,251
It appears there was no Jinchuriki here.

593
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:05,754
Let's move on to the next one as soon
as I'm done with my prayer.

594
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:07,131
No...

595
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:12,219
I'm taking this body to trade in for money.

596
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:16,015
Money comes first.

597
00:41:18,623 --> 00:41:23,628
Listen, you're really starting
to irritate me. Really...

598
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,363
<i>I've got to inform the Hidden Leaf...</i>

599
00:41:32,758 --> 00:41:35,177
Then let's get going.

600
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:39,671
The Land of Fire is huge.
Let's take our time.

601
00:41:40,715 --> 00:41:44,344
I knew we were falling behind
because of you.

602
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:45,861
Ow!

603
00:41:49,121 --> 00:41:51,123
Wait! Hey!

604
00:42:06,245 --> 00:42:07,246
How's it going?

605
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,486
Are you able to control
the Nine-Tails chakra okay, Tenzo?

606
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,821
There are no problems so far.

607
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:16,784
Also, please call me Yamato,
not Tenzo.

608
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:18,344
Okay, okay.

609
00:42:22,013 --> 00:42:25,224
Yes! It cut quite a bit!

610
00:42:25,463 --> 00:42:29,342
Damn it!
And mine still hasn't cut at all!

611
00:42:30,572 --> 00:42:33,116
I'm much better than you guys!

612
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,719
We're the same person, idiot!

613
00:42:35,744 --> 00:42:36,745
Yes!

614
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:43,018
Damn it...
That me over there's pretty good...

615
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,271
I've got to do something...

616
00:42:47,725 --> 00:42:48,851
Say! Say!

617
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:51,110
I've got something I want to ask you,
Kakashi-sensei...

618
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:52,402
What is it?

619
00:42:52,427 --> 00:42:56,055
Is there anyone in the Leaf who has
a Wind nature?

620
00:42:57,099 --> 00:42:58,642
You're looking for the trick to it?

621
00:42:58,951 --> 00:42:59,724
Yeah!

622
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:03,455
Well, you could say
there's a person...

623
00:43:04,521 --> 00:43:06,689
Right about now
he's probably playing shogi...

624
00:43:10,534 --> 00:43:11,910
That's a first for you,

625
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,882
going with a climbing silver
right off the bat.

626
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,052
Let's take it nice and slow.
We've got the time, after all.

627
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:21,015
It's an advance guard for
breaking through the enemy's defense.

628
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,767
Sometimes you have to be able
to make moves like this.

629
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:29,690
I thought you didn't like moves like that.
Just like me.

630
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:35,279
Sacrifice is required in order to protect
the king when your opponent is skilled.

631
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:41,118
I just now started to understand
the importance of the "king."

632
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:45,581
Well... The game is over if
you get your king taken in shogi.

633
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:49,501
If you were to liken the Hidden
Leaf shinobi to a shogi piece...

634
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:53,088
Shikamaru...
In the end, you would be a knight.

635
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:54,882
Although weak in strength,

636
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:57,718
a knight can advance
by jumping over pieces.

637
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:02,848
This unique movement resembles
your flexible thinking.

638
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,769
Then what would you be?

639
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,729
I'm nothing.

640
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:13,129
Then... do you know who the "king" is?

641
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,321
The Hokage, right?

642
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:20,616
That's what I thought
until just recently...

643
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:23,160
But it's not like that.

644
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,788
Then who is it?

645
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:30,209
You'll understand when the time comes.

646
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:31,318
Hey!

647
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:34,171
Asuma-sensei!

648
00:44:34,696 --> 00:44:36,614
Oh, it's Naruto.

649
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,384
Is there something you need?

650
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:41,720
As it happens,
there's something I want to ask you...

651
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:46,141
The trick to the Wind
change in chakra nature, huh...?

652
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:46,975
Right!

653
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:50,938
Don't tell me you're doing chakra
change in chakra nature training?

654
00:44:51,376 --> 00:44:52,377
Yeah!

655
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:54,692
You've got to have a sense
for that kind of thing...

656
00:44:54,814 --> 00:44:56,357
Can you handle it?

657
00:44:57,069 --> 00:45:00,280
That's why I came here
to ask Asuma-sensei.

658
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:04,660
You've got the same Wind
chakra property as me, right, Sensei?

659
00:45:05,815 --> 00:45:08,443
I never thought you'd have
the Wind chakra property, Naruto...

660
00:45:08,969 --> 00:45:10,136
This is, indeed, a shock.

661
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:14,378
Asuma-sensei, please teach me
the trick to it... right away.

662
00:45:15,405 --> 00:45:16,990
Let me see...

663
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,633
I could think about it if you'd pay
the barbecue bill

664
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:22,720
for Team Asuma's
next end-of-mission party...

665
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,638
Oh! That's dirty!

666
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:25,764
What do you think?

667
00:45:28,478 --> 00:45:31,564
I have no choice.
It's for my training!

668
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,689
All right! It's a deal.

669
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:37,276
This is my chakra blade...

670
00:45:39,314 --> 00:45:41,108
This blade is made from
a special metal

671
00:45:41,142 --> 00:45:43,978
that absorbs
the owner's chakra property.

672
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,702
That's awesome...

673
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,078
Here, take it.

674
00:45:50,131 --> 00:45:52,509
Try pouring your chakra into the blade.

675
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:54,042
Right.

676
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:02,872
My chakra... kind of comes out
different from yours, Asuma-sensei.

677
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:04,511
Listen up.

678
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:07,890
The Wind change in chakra nature
splits chakra in two

679
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,516
and grinds them together.

680
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:10,950
Grinds them together?

681
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:16,273
And then you build up
the two chakra as if steadily honing them.

682
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:20,068
As if steadily ... honing them...

683
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:21,695
That's right...

684
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,323
The trick is steady... and sharp.

685
00:46:25,326 --> 00:46:28,788
Say... um... I was thinking...

686
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:29,745
What is it?

687
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:32,414
Even though we've got
ninja tools to start with...

688
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:35,709
what's the point of this
Wind Nature Transformation?

689
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:40,506
Wouldn't it be quicker just to cut with
something that cuts right from the start?

690
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,549
And is there a point...

691
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:46,303
to pouring chakra into
a weapon that already cuts?

692
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:49,807
Okay. I'll show you whether
or not there's a point to that...

693
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:51,350
Listen up.

694
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:55,854
We'll try throwing these chakra blades
toward that tree at the same time.

695
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:58,315
What for?

696
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,359
Don't worry about that. Let's go.

697
00:47:01,828 --> 00:47:03,538
One, two--!

698
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,870
Th-That's awesome!

699
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,039
It went all the way through...

700
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:17,734
not just the tree but into that
really hard rock and got lodged inside...

701
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,755
It's dangerous,
so I held back just now.

702
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:24,466
It would've gone right through
the rock if I'd gone all out.

703
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:28,470
The quality of the blade
will determine the result

704
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:31,890
in the case of ninja of the same level
getting into a serious battle.

705
00:47:33,102 --> 00:47:34,896
The Wind property has
the most attack power

706
00:47:34,921 --> 00:47:38,008
in close to medium-range battles.

707
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:42,150
There really aren't
that many Wind types.

708
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:43,819
Oh, really...?

709
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:47,197
Come on by if there's ever
anything else you want to ask me...

710
00:47:47,609 --> 00:47:49,820
But you'll have to pay
for the barbecue.

711
00:47:50,369 --> 00:47:51,317
Right!

712
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,761
Thanks!

713
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:57,708
Oh, it was a shadow clone?

714
00:47:58,625 --> 00:47:59,751
That Naruto...

715
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:02,629
He forgot that we've got
Choji on our team.

716
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:04,548
That's harsh...

717
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:11,459
I get it! So that's how to do it!

718
00:48:11,484 --> 00:48:12,568
All right!

719
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:14,182
- Let's do it!
- Let's do it!

720
00:48:15,604 --> 00:48:18,565
<i>It appears he found out the trick
to it from Asuma.</i>

721
00:48:19,866 --> 00:48:21,284
<i>He's already doing a good job</i>

722
00:48:21,309 --> 00:48:24,473
<i>of applying the attributes of
his shadow clones, that Naruto...</i>

723
00:48:28,706 --> 00:48:29,707
What's that?

724
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,761
I see...

725
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:36,830
So they even took down Chiriku...

726
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,792
I was out on patrol...

727
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,503
and by the time I returned,
it was too late.

728
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,506
It was most likely the guys
from the Akatsuki.

729
00:48:47,078 --> 00:48:49,622
They're probably going one by one
to locations in the Land of Fire

730
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,678
where there might be a Jinchuriki.

731
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:56,308
Finally, they've come.

732
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,729
We won't let them out
of the Land of Fire.

733
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:04,232
Contact the twenty newly formed
squads immediately!

734
00:49:05,013 --> 00:49:08,558
All right! We'll go ahead and
have you accumulate experience.

735
00:49:10,685 --> 00:49:13,897
Lock in the experience from your training,
then release the jutsu!

736
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:15,452
- Right!
- Right!

737
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:16,912
All right! Let's go!

738
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:45,065
I can manage this...
I'll be able to do it soon...

739
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,273
The drawback is that

740
00:49:52,298 --> 00:49:55,318
you accumulate mental fatigue
right along with the experience.

741
00:49:56,702 --> 00:50:00,414
I knew that from the start...

742
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,542
But... I'm almost there...

743
00:50:04,113 --> 00:50:06,058
Let's take a short break, Naruto.

744
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:08,714
This isn't the time to be taking it easy!

745
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:11,049
I'm okay, Kakashi-sensei...

746
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:14,928
<i>Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

747
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,472
What...? Oh! Hey...
Just a minute!

748
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,030
We did it!

749
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:39,327
How about that, Kakashi-sensei?!

750
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:42,622
Huh?

751
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:53,800
Are you awake?

752
00:50:54,872 --> 00:50:55,957
Huh...?

753
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:58,346
Again... I...

754
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:00,474
You keep resting.

755
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,769
Fatigue tends to build up

756
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,896
when using the shadow clone
training approach.

757
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:09,066
Let's start the training again
after you've rested a little while.

758
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:11,485
What are we going to do next?

759
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:12,611
Next?

760
00:51:14,582 --> 00:51:16,167
The next step is...

761
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:20,410
to cut that waterfall!

762
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:24,081
Put your hands on the waterfall
and cut it

763
00:51:24,106 --> 00:51:25,983
by hammering it
with your Wind chakra.

764
00:51:27,023 --> 00:51:28,899
Cut... the waterfall?

765
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:32,740
For this, you need to instantly change the
chakra nature of a large amount of chakra.

766
00:51:32,765 --> 00:51:35,559
Or else you won't be able
to cut the waterfall.

767
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:37,886
You'll more or less be able
to use it in real battle

768
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,263
if you can pass this stage of training.

769
00:51:41,453 --> 00:51:42,496
Kakashi-sensei!

770
00:51:42,942 --> 00:51:44,152
If I can do that,

771
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:47,813
that means I've mastered my first
Nature Transformation, right?

772
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:52,818
All right, I'm getting better!

773
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:55,134
<i>I never thought that clumsy Naruto</i>

774
00:51:55,159 --> 00:51:59,538
<i>would be able to create
a change in chakra nature so soon.</i>

775
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:03,703
<i>This training approach...
was a big success.</i>

776
00:52:04,124 --> 00:52:05,667
Break time is over!

777
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:08,333
Let's get right back to training!

778
00:52:08,761 --> 00:52:09,971
<i>Wood Style Jutsu</i>

779
00:52:20,474 --> 00:52:22,434
That will be your training area.

780
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:23,640
Right.

781
00:52:23,665 --> 00:52:24,749
But hold on!

782
00:52:24,774 --> 00:52:27,401
Whoa... What is it?

783
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:32,190
You'll need Yamato's chakra control
at all times during this training.

784
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,733
I'm counting on you, Yamato.

785
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:34,943
Okay.

786
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,888
Preparations complete, Naruto!

787
00:53:04,572 --> 00:53:06,491
<i>Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

788
00:53:22,317 --> 00:53:24,695
<i>Form a mental image
of my Wind chakra and...</i>

789
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,289
<i>Steady and sharp!</i>

790
00:53:29,355 --> 00:53:31,065
Let's go, guys!

791
00:53:31,267 --> 00:53:32,310
Right!

792
00:53:38,523 --> 00:53:42,694
Damn it! The water should
splash just a bit...

793
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:44,512
Let's go to the next one!

794
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:45,513
Right!

795
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:53,396
As to be expected,
this will probably take a while.

796
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:56,608
Well, be patient.

797
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:08,703
You carry him for a while.

798
00:54:09,044 --> 00:54:10,629
Hey, hey, hey.

799
00:54:10,763 --> 00:54:12,932
You're the one always
talking about money.

800
00:54:13,439 --> 00:54:15,441
You carry him all the way.

801
00:54:15,801 --> 00:54:17,678
He's your precious bounty, right?

802
00:54:20,626 --> 00:54:24,254
What's with that look?

803
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:29,266
I swear, I'm going to kill you someday.

804
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:34,020
I told you, don't give me that... Kakuzu.

805
00:55:07,324 --> 00:55:08,325
Here you go...

806
00:55:08,414 --> 00:55:09,415
Thanks...

807
00:55:10,281 --> 00:55:11,366
Who are they for...?

808
00:55:11,455 --> 00:55:13,749
Oh, nobody in particular...

809
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:15,770
See you later...

810
00:55:16,001 --> 00:55:18,212
Say "Hi" to Kurenai-sensei for me!

811
00:55:18,531 --> 00:55:21,409
<i>Wha--?! How did...
you know that?!</i>

812
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:24,763
Oh, there he is...

813
00:55:25,189 --> 00:55:28,204
Sorry to bother you while you're
on your way to Kurenai-sensei's place...

814
00:55:28,229 --> 00:55:30,856
Huh? You guys, too?
How...?

815
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:33,965
Huh? Everybody knows...

816
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:34,950
Shikamaru!

817
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,041
Oh... right...

818
00:55:37,475 --> 00:55:38,977
We received orders
from the Fifth Hokage

819
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:40,670
for everyone from Team Asuma

820
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:44,966
including myself, Choji and Ino
to assemble immediately.

821
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:46,468
What?!

822
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:49,804
What...? All members from...
the old Team 10...?

823
00:55:49,996 --> 00:55:50,810
Yeah...

824
00:55:56,878 --> 00:55:59,381
Does anyone have any questions?

825
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:01,983
What is it?

826
00:56:03,047 --> 00:56:05,466
Chiriku, a former member
of the Guardian Shinobi Twelve,

827
00:56:05,491 --> 00:56:07,035
should be there.

828
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,407
What happened to him?

829
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:15,622
Lord Chiriku died by their hands.

830
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:30,387
<i>Chiriku was killed?
It can't be...</i>

831
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:37,727
For the pride of the Hidden Leaf,
and most of all,

832
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:40,021
for the safety of the Land of Fire,

833
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:43,691
we cannot allow them to move freely
any longer.

834
00:56:46,106 --> 00:56:49,401
I want to know what they're after,
but they're very dangerous.

835
00:56:52,111 --> 00:56:54,572
Don't let them out of the Land of Fire,
no matter what.

836
00:56:54,817 --> 00:56:58,904
Find them without fail and
if you're unable to restrain them,

837
00:56:59,026 --> 00:57:00,111
kill them!

838
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:01,793
Go!

839
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:02,836
Dismissed!

840
00:57:07,667 --> 00:57:08,960
Now then...

841
00:57:08,985 --> 00:57:11,446
Okay, we'll start with
the Temple of Fire.

842
00:57:14,076 --> 00:57:15,994
Someone has to do it.

843
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:20,353
Let's go.

844
00:57:31,765 --> 00:57:33,267
Kakashi-sensei!

845
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:38,788
Don't you think I need
more shadow clones?!

846
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:40,874
You can't cut the waterfall
unless you perform

847
00:57:40,899 --> 00:57:43,277
the change in chakra nature
with a large amount of Wind chakra!

848
00:57:43,629 --> 00:57:47,591
The chakra for each clone will disperse
if there are too many of them!

849
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:52,552
And we can barely line up ten clones
with the width of that waterfall!

850
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:55,555
Do you really want me to learn this or not?

851
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:59,978
Then give us a hint on how to get
even a little better!

852
00:58:00,044 --> 00:58:01,828
You're not holding the chakra

853
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:03,938
you've built up inside
your body long enough!

854
00:58:04,023 --> 00:58:06,276
Take your time and be more efficient!

855
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:10,094
But if we don't get a move on,
this won't be of any use in a real battle.

856
00:58:10,513 --> 00:58:12,474
You're in training right now.

857
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:14,991
You don't need to be thinking
about real battles.

858
00:58:15,232 --> 00:58:16,942
It will get quicker
once you get used to it.

859
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:18,478
But...

860
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:20,555
Listen...

861
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:24,083
Change in chakra nature training
normally takes several years.

862
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,495
Under normal conditions,
it takes six months to even cut a leaf.

863
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:30,632
You completed that in only
a few hours.

864
00:58:31,533 --> 00:58:32,910
No need to be so impatient.

865
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:36,096
You're progressing several times
faster than we expected.

866
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:39,474
It even took a genius like Sasuke
several days to master his

867
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:42,852
Lightning Nature Transformation
when I taught him the Chidori.

868
00:58:44,126 --> 00:58:47,206
I have to catch up with Sasuke!

869
00:58:56,832 --> 00:58:57,958
Good grief...

870
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:04,457
Tenzo...

871
00:59:08,967 --> 00:59:10,343
Understood.

872
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,252
That was a little tough on you, huh?

873
00:59:48,277 --> 00:59:50,154
No! Not at all.

874
00:59:52,529 --> 00:59:53,780
N-Not in the least...

875
00:59:54,717 --> 00:59:56,219
<i>It was tough...</i>

876
00:59:57,176 --> 00:59:58,469
How's that, Naruto?!

877
00:59:58,905 --> 01:00:00,698
Now you've got nothing
to gripe about, right?!

878
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:04,726
<i>Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

879
01:00:32,763 --> 01:00:34,807
<i>Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu.</i>

880
01:00:50,182 --> 01:00:51,392
Damn it!

881
01:00:57,587 --> 01:01:00,715
<i>As long as I don't give in</i>

882
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:03,451
<i>and keep going without
stopping to rest...</i>

883
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,953
<i>I'll arrive at the point where...</i>

884
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:08,581
Here we go!

885
01:01:14,766 --> 01:01:15,934
All right!

886
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:20,677
This training is something else, isn't it?

887
01:01:20,929 --> 01:01:23,098
Naruto is progressing
so quickly.

888
01:01:23,646 --> 01:01:27,900
No... It's not just because
of this training approach.

889
01:01:31,162 --> 01:01:33,539
Sasuke has something
to do with it, too.

890
01:01:35,903 --> 01:01:39,449
- We cut the waterfall!
- We really cut it!

891
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:47,745
Well done.

892
01:01:47,745 --> 01:01:51,582
Now we can start development
of your new original jutsu.

893
01:01:53,073 --> 01:01:55,534
Right... I got it...

894
01:01:59,447 --> 01:02:01,157
You okay, Naruto?!

895
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:03,886
<i>I guess he overdid it a little.</i>

896
01:02:08,015 --> 01:02:09,726
Wh-What is it?

897
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:14,981
I'm... hungry...

898
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:19,944
<i>You really are... something else.</i>

899
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:31,914
We asked neighboring temples
for help recovering the remains.

900
01:02:35,378 --> 01:02:36,629
This is awful.

901
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:39,797
Where's Chiriku?

902
01:02:41,678 --> 01:02:46,015
Actually... we have been unable
to find Lord Chiriku's remains.

903
01:02:48,335 --> 01:02:50,421
Umm... Captain Asuma.

904
01:02:51,931 --> 01:02:54,684
I don't really want to bring this up...

905
01:02:55,396 --> 01:02:58,357
But Chiriku has a 30 million-ryo bounty
on his head

906
01:02:58,357 --> 01:02:59,942
on the black market.

907
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:01,360
A bounty...

908
01:03:02,090 --> 01:03:05,260
If those guys from the Akatsuki
know about the bounty...

909
01:03:05,656 --> 01:03:06,299
Yeah...

910
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:08,993
Izumo, where's the nearest
collection office?

911
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:13,790
Including the closest one,
there are five locations in total.

912
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:23,090
The other teams can rush to the other
four collection offices.

913
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,802
All right, let's hurry.

914
01:03:25,843 --> 01:03:29,222
Please wait a moment,
Lord Asuma Sarutobi.

915
01:03:30,789 --> 01:03:34,960
You have a bounty on your head
for being a former member

916
01:03:35,821 --> 01:03:37,974
of the Guardian Shinobi Twelve...
just like Chiriku.

917
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:44,153
Please allow me to say a prayer
for all of you who are about to fight.

918
01:03:47,318 --> 01:03:48,486
Okay.

919
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:53,621
All right, let's get
right back to training!

920
01:03:53,746 --> 01:03:55,414
No, before that...

921
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:56,541
Huh?

922
01:03:56,822 --> 01:04:01,076
Naruto... I'll show you something cool.

923
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:03,673
Something cool?

924
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:06,008
There are some things
I want to explain to you

925
01:04:06,033 --> 01:04:07,952
while we take a little rest after eating.

926
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:10,855
What?
More complicated explanations?

927
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:16,561
Don't worry... I'm a good teacher,
so you'll get it.

928
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:19,188
Here's your bill.

929
01:04:19,897 --> 01:04:21,983
Yamato, you take care of this.

930
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:25,987
What?! Isn't it usually the senior
who takes care of it?

931
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:29,156
There are no seniors or juniors
regarding the men I respect.

932
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:33,379
Well, you're pretty much
the only junior...

933
01:04:33,404 --> 01:04:35,281
I respect.

934
01:04:37,164 --> 01:04:39,834
But I suppose I really should...

935
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:44,714
- Thank you very much!
- Oh, keep the change.

936
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:49,343
You really are a slick talker.

937
01:04:57,184 --> 01:04:58,394
Asuma-sensei...

938
01:04:59,898 --> 01:05:03,276
What kind of relationship did
you have with that Chiriku guy?

939
01:05:04,201 --> 01:05:05,452
What's the deal all of a sudden?

940
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:09,947
You're a heavy smoker, but you haven't
lit up in two whole days.

941
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:15,077
You always stop smoking...
when something has happened.

942
01:05:15,267 --> 01:05:16,768
You're so observant...

943
01:05:17,438 --> 01:05:21,609
I'm far too soft if you can see
right through to my heart like that.

944
01:05:22,155 --> 01:05:24,658
Well, I can always tell

945
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:26,672
what move you're going to make
when we play shogi.

946
01:05:28,607 --> 01:05:31,485
You haven't looked like this since
the Third Hokage passed away.

947
01:05:36,635 --> 01:05:37,803
Chiriku and I...

948
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:40,853
were part of the
Guardian Shinobi Twelve.

949
01:05:43,269 --> 01:05:48,607
I guess you could say...
we were like you and Choji.

950
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:56,369
You won't stop smoking for long.

951
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:59,747
I won't stop smoking for long... huh?

952
01:05:59,997 --> 01:06:03,542
Shikamaru, I appreciate you
worrying about me.

953
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:07,296
But I didn't stop smoking
because of Chiriku.

954
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:11,968
More importantly, the guys from Akatsuki
are good enough to kill Chiriku.

955
01:06:12,873 --> 01:06:14,917
They're dangerously skilled.

956
01:06:15,596 --> 01:06:16,639
Stay sharp!

957
01:06:24,406 --> 01:06:27,576
Kakashi-sensei,
what are you going to show me?

958
01:06:28,508 --> 01:06:32,971
This is the cool thing...
I wanted to show you.

959
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:40,705
This is...

960
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:51,173
R-Rasengan...?

961
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:58,973
You can also use...
the Rasengan, Kakashi-sensei?!

962
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:05,229
And all I can do is spin it around
into shape with a clone...

963
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:08,024
Man, this is too much trouble...

964
01:07:10,317 --> 01:07:14,030
I didn't show you the Rasengan because
I wanted to brag about it or anything.

965
01:07:14,889 --> 01:07:17,850
Listen up. When you take chakra
and add in change in chakra form

966
01:07:17,875 --> 01:07:20,085
and change in chakra nature...

967
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:22,872
the attack power of a shinobi
rises dramatically.

968
01:07:23,639 --> 01:07:26,558
Well, there are hardly any shinobi
who can use

969
01:07:26,583 --> 01:07:29,378
both change in chakra form
and nature, though.

970
01:07:29,905 --> 01:07:31,865
I knew it. You're bragging.

971
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:35,634
You obtained the Wind Nature
Transformation in your training earlier.

972
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:40,431
And you already possess
the ultimate change in chakra form...

973
01:07:41,515 --> 01:07:42,516
Rasengan?

974
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:43,976
That's right.

975
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:48,856
Then that means...

976
01:07:49,337 --> 01:07:51,673
I already have both?

977
01:07:52,251 --> 01:07:54,628
Well... that's pretty much the case.

978
01:07:56,864 --> 01:08:01,535
All right! Then it looks like I'll be able
to get a new jutsu just like that!

979
01:08:02,179 --> 01:08:04,932
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

980
01:08:06,716 --> 01:08:09,302
This is going to be easy!

981
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:12,213
If it were that easy,

982
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:14,757
it wouldn't have been necessary
for me to develop the Chidori.

983
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:23,057
I wasn't able to combine
the Rasengan's change in chakra form

984
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:25,309
with my Lightning Nature Transformation.

985
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:28,979
Phenomenal technique is
necessary to combine

986
01:08:29,004 --> 01:08:31,965
the change in chakra nature
with the change in chakra form.

987
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:36,529
Well, it might be better to say one needs
a phenomenal "ability" or "sense."

988
01:08:37,293 --> 01:08:39,462
I wasn't the only one who
was not able to get this far.

989
01:08:41,575 --> 01:08:44,662
It was the same even for
the teacher who invented this jutsu.

990
01:08:45,037 --> 01:08:46,038
Teacher?

991
01:08:46,285 --> 01:08:47,286
That's right...

992
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:50,793
Even the Fourth Hokage
couldn't do it.

993
01:08:52,336 --> 01:08:55,464
The Fourth Hokage took
the change in chakra form

994
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:57,216
to the highest possible level.

995
01:08:58,008 --> 01:08:59,844
And that's the Rasengan.

996
01:09:05,492 --> 01:09:08,746
The change in chakra form alone
makes it an A-rank technique.

997
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:12,607
Even I can somehow copy it
if it's just to this degree.

998
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,442
The problem is what comes after that.

999
01:09:16,899 --> 01:09:20,798
The Fourth Hokage originally
developed the Rasengan

1000
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:24,201
intending to add his own
change in chakra nature to it.

1001
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:29,874
So you're saying the Rasengan was
an unfinished jutsu?

1002
01:09:30,916 --> 01:09:32,626
That's pretty much the case.

1003
01:09:33,609 --> 01:09:36,737
Any jutsu beyond that would be

1004
01:09:36,762 --> 01:09:40,265
an S-rank difficulty level or
maybe even higher.

1005
01:09:41,964 --> 01:09:45,218
Furthermore,
it might be impossible to begin with...

1006
01:09:47,224 --> 01:09:48,976
I won't be able to teach you
what comes next.

1007
01:09:49,490 --> 01:09:51,117
You'll have to discover it for yourself.

1008
01:09:53,397 --> 01:09:57,693
Do you know why
I'm telling you this, Naruto?

1009
01:09:59,405 --> 01:10:02,199
It's because
I believe you're the only shinobi...

1010
01:10:02,224 --> 01:10:05,769
who can surpass the Fourth Hokage.

1011
01:10:11,248 --> 01:10:14,043
Well... That's enough talk for now.

1012
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:18,088
I guess we'll start up training again
after a bit more rest.

1013
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:27,681
Just what I'd expect from you, Kakashi.

1014
01:10:27,973 --> 01:10:29,808
You really are a good teacher.

1015
01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:33,103
No...

1016
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:39,735
I really do believe in him.

1017
01:10:42,613 --> 01:10:44,615
<i>Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

1018
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:58,879
This is the collection office.

1019
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:02,967
Why put a secret door in a bathroom?

1020
01:11:04,304 --> 01:11:05,305
This way.

1021
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:15,813
Put it here.

1022
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:17,439
Okay.

1023
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:21,318
Hurry up and get it done!

1024
01:11:28,575 --> 01:11:32,288
No doubt about it.
It's Chiriku.

1025
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:36,041
You got yourself a big one
this time, Kakuzu.

1026
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:37,418
Yeah...

1027
01:11:48,578 --> 01:11:50,663
Hey, this place stinks.

1028
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:53,267
Let's get going, Kakuzu.

1029
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,936
Wait. I'm going to count the money.

1030
01:11:59,773 --> 01:12:01,608
I'm never coming to a place
like this again.

1031
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:04,111
I can't tell if the stench is
from the piss or the corpses.

1032
01:12:06,113 --> 01:12:07,740
I'll be outside.

1033
01:12:14,872 --> 01:12:18,625
Sure enough, he's quick to tire when
using his Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu.

1034
01:12:21,253 --> 01:12:22,254
Damn it...

1035
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:24,131
Let's go!

1036
01:12:24,298 --> 01:12:25,050
Right!

1037
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:30,346
Incorporate Wind chakra into this.

1038
01:12:42,883 --> 01:12:44,343
Damn it!

1039
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:49,741
<i>It's no use.</i>

1040
01:12:50,889 --> 01:12:55,561
<i>And here I need a ton of concentration
just for the Rasengan.</i>

1041
01:12:57,894 --> 01:13:00,938
<i>And then I have to add my
Nature Transformation on top of that...</i>

1042
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:07,341
<i>It's like trying to look left and right
at the same time.</i>

1043
01:13:08,764 --> 01:13:09,765
Damn it!

1044
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:14,264
This isn't the time to be throwing
in the towel already!

1045
01:13:19,603 --> 01:13:21,146
<i>Concentrate...</i>

1046
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:24,858
<i>Like grinding
the two chakra together...</i>

1047
01:13:35,788 --> 01:13:36,873
Hey! Tenzo!

1048
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:38,341
I know.

1049
01:13:48,465 --> 01:13:51,218
If Naruto keeps doing this, he'll...

1050
01:13:51,885 --> 01:13:54,138
And I can't keep stopping that
over and over again...

1051
01:13:54,888 --> 01:13:58,225
- I can't...
- No... This is the only way.

1052
01:13:59,056 --> 01:14:03,352
Whether or not his jutsu
is completed rides on you.

1053
01:14:08,219 --> 01:14:09,220
I understand...

1054
01:14:20,205 --> 01:14:21,540
Ohh, it stinks!

1055
01:14:22,008 --> 01:14:24,010
Being stuck in a dump like that
for five minutes and the stench

1056
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:25,961
would soak right into my clothes.

1057
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:29,715
Took you long enough, Kakuzu.

1058
01:14:44,324 --> 01:14:45,367
Too slow.

1059
01:14:47,705 --> 01:14:48,831
We got one to start.

1060
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:54,781
That hurts, you bastards.

1061
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:59,870
What's the meaning of this?
We pierced his vital spots.

1062
01:15:00,439 --> 01:15:01,815
Don't push it in deeper like that!

1063
01:15:02,873 --> 01:15:04,374
Hey, that hurts!

1064
01:15:04,689 --> 01:15:06,482
Is this guy... immortal?

1065
01:15:06,973 --> 01:15:11,394
Isn't it obvious?
So... who are you guys?

1066
01:15:17,971 --> 01:15:19,306
That mark.

1067
01:15:19,406 --> 01:15:22,028
If I remember correctly, it's from
the Guardian Shinobi or something...

1068
01:15:22,053 --> 01:15:23,604
Are you kidding me?

1069
01:15:24,024 --> 01:15:27,778
Do I have to go back inside that
smelly collection office again?

1070
01:15:27,905 --> 01:15:28,906
<i>Chiriku...</i>

1071
01:15:29,855 --> 01:15:31,398
We're Hidden Leaf shinobi.

1072
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:36,073
We've been ordered to either
capture or eliminate you Akatsuki.

1073
01:15:36,855 --> 01:15:39,357
Akatsuki operate in teams of two.

1074
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:42,079
Our intention was to take down
one of you first

1075
01:15:42,104 --> 01:15:44,023
and then capture the other.

1076
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:48,168
But you're pretty tough,
as was expected.

1077
01:15:48,888 --> 01:15:52,183
<i>So this is the Akatsuki...
Their abilities are insane.</i>

1078
01:15:52,923 --> 01:15:54,591
<i>My Shadow Sewing probably won't...</i>

1079
01:15:56,935 --> 01:16:00,605
You jerks went after us
in the wrong order.

1080
01:16:01,098 --> 01:16:02,349
Where's the other one?

1081
01:16:06,937 --> 01:16:08,522
The jutsu's broken!

1082
01:16:09,749 --> 01:16:11,293
Kotetsu, Izumo, get back!

1083
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:17,155
<i>Sure enough, the guy in the middle...</i>

1084
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:20,325
This is a first, you being interested
in money, Hidan.

1085
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:23,662
Kakuzu...

1086
01:16:24,431 --> 01:16:25,640
You stay out of this.

1087
01:16:25,956 --> 01:16:27,666
I'm going to use these guys for my ritual.

1088
01:16:28,208 --> 01:16:29,710
I'll give you the money.

1089
01:16:29,793 --> 01:16:34,756
Very well... But don't get careless.
You'll die.

1090
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:39,428
I told you.
Don't give me that.

1091
01:16:43,348 --> 01:16:46,018
If they could kill me,
I'd want them to.

1092
01:16:47,227 --> 01:16:49,313
Well... I guess it's impossible, huh?!

1093
01:16:49,869 --> 01:16:50,870
I'll charge him.

1094
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:53,108
Shikamaru, exploit an opening

1095
01:16:53,133 --> 01:16:55,260
and restrain the immortal guy
with your Shadow Sewing.

1096
01:16:55,569 --> 01:16:56,903
It doesn't have to be for long.

1097
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:59,448
I'll take his head off immediately
and stop his movements.

1098
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:03,452
That's too risky.
This isn't like you.

1099
01:17:03,771 --> 01:17:05,023
I should go with you.

1100
01:17:05,662 --> 01:17:06,663
Don't you get it?!

1101
01:17:06,955 --> 01:17:08,832
It's the only move we have right now!

1102
01:17:09,462 --> 01:17:11,506
<i>I've never seen Asuma
look like this before.</i>

1103
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:15,213
These guys are way
stronger than me.

1104
01:17:16,173 --> 01:17:18,817
Izumo, Kotetsu,
you guys back up Shikamaru

1105
01:17:18,842 --> 01:17:21,553
while keeping an eye on
the other Akatsuki guy.

1106
01:17:21,928 --> 01:17:24,598
If we know what they're capable of,
then all the more reason

1107
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,309
we should pull out for now
and plan a strategy.

1108
01:17:27,887 --> 01:17:30,640
They won't let us get away
that easily.

1109
01:17:33,741 --> 01:17:35,159
If we try to escape
without putting up a fight,

1110
01:17:35,192 --> 01:17:36,735
we'll be completely wiped out...

1111
01:17:37,412 --> 01:17:39,897
If that happens, the Hidden Leaf
will be in even greater danger.

1112
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:42,741
It's like sending in an advance unit
to break through enemy lines.

1113
01:17:42,766 --> 01:17:45,268
Sometimes you have to be able
to make a move like that.

1114
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:49,206
A climbing silver doesn't suit you.

1115
01:17:50,415 --> 01:17:54,670
I'm no mere sacrificial pawn.
I've got you with me, after all.

1116
01:17:55,629 --> 01:17:56,630
<i>How pathetic...</i>

1117
01:17:57,089 --> 01:17:59,466
<i>I can't be the bait and I can't put
pressure on the enemy.</i>

1118
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:01,802
<i>But I'll divert the major pieces
like crazy.</i>

1119
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:04,439
Are you done with
your little strategy session?

1120
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:10,875
Getting cut up like that
hurts like hell! you jerks!

1121
01:18:12,838 --> 01:18:15,925
Divine judgment will be passed
upon you bastards

1122
01:18:16,108 --> 01:18:18,402
who know nothing of the pain of others.

1123
01:18:35,972 --> 01:18:37,766
You've got a nice weapon there!

1124
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:56,773
<i>If combo and pinpoint attacks won't hit...</i>

1125
01:18:59,208 --> 01:19:00,834
<i>Burning Ash!</i>

1126
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:28,013
It hurts, doesn't it?

1127
01:19:29,055 --> 01:19:30,056
Well?

1128
01:19:36,313 --> 01:19:38,231
The judgment has been
handed down.

1129
01:19:39,567 --> 01:19:40,568
How about it?

1130
01:19:40,942 --> 01:19:42,819
Has this helped you understand
the pain that other people feel,

1131
01:19:42,861 --> 01:19:43,862
even a little bit?

1132
01:19:45,322 --> 01:19:46,831
<i>Even my arm...</i>

1133
01:19:47,217 --> 01:19:48,968
<i>Has his jutsu done something?</i>

1134
01:19:50,118 --> 01:19:51,119
<i>No, that can't be...</i>

1135
01:19:51,444 --> 01:19:55,239
You have already fallen
under my curse.

1136
01:19:56,447 --> 01:19:58,615
The ceremony will now begin.

1137
01:20:04,743 --> 01:20:05,744
Well, then...

1138
01:20:06,868 --> 01:20:10,539
Why not taste the ultimate pain
with me?!

1139
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:14,684
<i>That's a 35 million ryo bounty.</i>

1140
01:20:17,670 --> 01:20:19,755
All the preparations are now complete!

1141
01:20:19,878 --> 01:20:23,131
It's going to hurt like crazy,
so get ready!

1142
01:20:32,322 --> 01:20:33,428
Take that!

1143
01:20:38,291 --> 01:20:39,751
It hurts, doesn't it?!

1144
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:46,842
But this is nothing.
I haven't got you in a vital spot yet!

1145
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:51,429
Trust me, the REAL pain is
something else entirely!

1146
01:20:51,638 --> 01:20:56,476
The pain another feels while
dying penetrates into my own body!

1147
01:20:56,758 --> 01:21:01,262
I pass through the pain, transcend it,
and turn it into pleasure!

1148
01:21:06,778 --> 01:21:07,779
<i>But of course...</i>

1149
01:21:08,196 --> 01:21:12,409
<i>His body and mine are connected
with some curse.</i>

1150
01:21:13,076 --> 01:21:16,997
<i>In other words, the damage dealt
to our bodies is also linked.</i>

1151
01:21:18,022 --> 01:21:20,733
<i>Furthermore, he is immortal.</i>

1152
01:21:23,813 --> 01:21:26,357
Where would you like to hurt next?

1153
01:21:26,726 --> 01:21:29,812
Hmm? Here? Or here?

1154
01:21:30,383 --> 01:21:32,783
How about both legs
at the same time?!

1155
01:21:34,412 --> 01:21:35,455
Or...

1156
01:21:38,429 --> 01:21:40,562
shall we end now?!

1157
01:21:41,099 --> 01:21:41,933
How about it?!

1158
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:45,912
Die--!

1159
01:21:46,223 --> 01:21:47,891
Do you think I'd let that happen?!

1160
01:21:58,955 --> 01:22:00,540
You did it, Shikamaru!

1161
01:22:02,590 --> 01:22:04,508
This won't stop me for long!

1162
01:22:11,968 --> 01:22:15,371
Izumo, how many minutes have passed
since you requested backup?

1163
01:22:15,528 --> 01:22:16,696
About ten minutes.

1164
01:22:17,223 --> 01:22:19,809
It'll be at least another 20 minutes
before reinforcements arrive.

1165
01:22:19,834 --> 01:22:20,835
That long?!

1166
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:24,314
Damn...! What should we do?!

1167
01:22:24,814 --> 01:22:27,275
If we kill him,
Captain Asuma will also die!

1168
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:31,696
To break a persistent curse-type jutsu,
you usually have to kill the user.

1169
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:34,449
But if that is not possible...

1170
01:22:35,241 --> 01:22:38,356
<i>Every jutsu inevitably has rules
associated with it,</i>

1171
01:22:38,381 --> 01:22:40,717
<i>as well as risks and pitfalls.</i>

1172
01:22:41,456 --> 01:22:44,542
<i>First, I need to calm down
and analyze the opponent.</i>

1173
01:22:45,293 --> 01:22:47,337
<i>I was saved,
thanks to Shikamaru.</i>

1174
01:22:47,712 --> 01:22:51,466
<i>I must take this chance and
think of a way to break this jutsu.</i>

1175
01:22:53,009 --> 01:22:55,553
If this wears on any
longer, I'll lend a hand.

1176
01:22:59,015 --> 01:23:02,644
We can't let all the money get away.

1177
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:05,689
I told you to stay out of this, Kakuzu!

1178
01:23:07,232 --> 01:23:09,526
I can handle this...!

1179
01:23:11,397 --> 01:23:16,569
<i>Remarks, personality, speech patterns...
the clothes they wear...</i>

1180
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:19,035
<i>Grasp their movements
right up to now.</i>

1181
01:23:19,244 --> 01:23:20,954
<i>The significance of
each and every action.</i>

1182
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:24,207
<i>And then the connection between actions.</i>

1183
01:23:24,876 --> 01:23:28,988
<i>Develop a hypothesis about their abilities
that can be drawn from all these factors.</i>

1184
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:31,631
<i>It's all about observation and analysis.</i>

1185
01:23:32,924 --> 01:23:35,135
<i>God's judgment will be handed down!</i>

1186
01:23:35,885 --> 01:23:37,721
<i>God... judgment...</i>

1187
01:23:38,596 --> 01:23:41,391
<i>You have already fallen under my curse.</i>

1188
01:23:42,308 --> 01:23:44,602
<i>The ceremony will now begin.</i>

1189
01:23:44,965 --> 01:23:46,800
<i>A curse... the ceremony...</i>

1190
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:50,316
<i>With this, all preparations are complete!</i>

1191
01:23:50,525 --> 01:23:51,526
<i>Preparations...!</i>

1192
01:24:07,083 --> 01:24:09,169
Did you figure something out, Shikamaru?

1193
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:10,462
Yeah!

1194
01:24:10,756 --> 01:24:12,883
<i>It's amazing that you're capable
of such an analysis</i>

1195
01:24:13,159 --> 01:24:14,911
<i>while still maintaining your jutsu.</i>

1196
01:24:15,341 --> 01:24:17,427
I'm heading out, Captain Asuma...

1197
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:35,487
<i>That shadow jutsu...</i>

1198
01:24:35,695 --> 01:24:39,365
<i>Does it force the person it's used on
to mirror the motions of its caster?</i>

1199
01:24:47,952 --> 01:24:51,039
Why you... Trying to sniff
out the true nature of my jutsu.

1200
01:24:54,016 --> 01:24:55,058
What are you going to do?!

1201
01:24:55,343 --> 01:25:00,015
I'll drag that bastard outside of that
circle he drew on the ground!

1202
01:25:00,613 --> 01:25:03,950
If I do that,
his curse jutsu will be broken.

1203
01:25:05,216 --> 01:25:06,592
What on earth does that mean?!

1204
01:25:07,268 --> 01:25:09,020
His weapon...

1205
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:10,814
That huge scythe with three blades.

1206
01:25:11,084 --> 01:25:14,837
Judging by its shape, I'd say it's not
designed to land a single fatal blow,

1207
01:25:14,984 --> 01:25:17,070
but rather increase
his attack range.

1208
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:22,534
All his weapons are designed to
cause damage from a distance.

1209
01:25:24,202 --> 01:25:27,705
In other words, his tactic is to
only injure his opponent

1210
01:25:27,705 --> 01:25:31,584
and then buy time to deploy
a lethal jutsu.

1211
01:25:32,366 --> 01:25:33,617
And by that you mean the curse?

1212
01:25:34,046 --> 01:25:37,299
But what's the connection between
the enemy's wound and the curse?

1213
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:41,261
It's blood...

1214
01:25:42,146 --> 01:25:44,315
In order to form a link between himself
and his targeted opponent,

1215
01:25:44,430 --> 01:25:48,268
he needs to find a way to incorporate
that opponent's blood into his own body.

1216
01:25:49,787 --> 01:25:54,625
Then if he wounds his opponent and even
a little blood adheres to that sickle...

1217
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,443
he can place his curse.

1218
01:25:58,086 --> 01:25:59,087
<i>But of course...</i>

1219
01:25:59,392 --> 01:26:01,728
After licking the blood,
his body changed color.

1220
01:26:02,327 --> 01:26:07,416
That is a condition for invoking the curse.
But that's not all.

1221
01:26:07,623 --> 01:26:12,127
In order to completely invoke the curse,
one more condition must be met.

1222
01:26:12,603 --> 01:26:13,604
One more?

1223
01:26:14,610 --> 01:26:16,111
<i>This brat knows his stuff.</i>

1224
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:18,609
A little while ago,

1225
01:26:18,798 --> 01:26:21,926
that creep let Asuma's Fire Style jutsu
roll right off him.

1226
01:26:22,164 --> 01:26:23,541
He was unfazed,

1227
01:26:23,566 --> 01:26:26,486
but he hurried back to that strange pattern
drawn on the ground, remember?

1228
01:26:26,511 --> 01:26:29,901
And once he was standing inside that
pattern, he said the ceremony would begin.

1229
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:32,421
And by howling that the preparations
were now complete...

1230
01:26:33,346 --> 01:26:35,515
We can assume the ritual
for his curse jutsu

1231
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:38,943
is only complete once he steps
inside that pattern.

1232
01:26:42,518 --> 01:26:44,103
You little brat!

1233
01:26:45,325 --> 01:26:48,494
You talk too much.

1234
01:26:48,953 --> 01:26:51,039
You little brat!

1235
01:26:51,357 --> 01:26:53,645
Why you! I'll get you later!
I'll tear you limb from limb!

1236
01:26:53,670 --> 01:26:55,505
I'll pulverize you! I'll
turn you inside out!

1237
01:26:55,688 --> 01:26:57,482
There isn't going to be a "later"!

1238
01:27:00,037 --> 01:27:01,080
We got him out!

1239
01:27:01,263 --> 01:27:04,308
All right! The curse is broken!

1240
01:27:07,847 --> 01:27:08,848
<i>All right!</i>

1241
01:27:13,173 --> 01:27:14,132
Wha--?!

1242
01:27:16,475 --> 01:27:17,786
Crap...

1243
01:27:18,117 --> 01:27:19,243
I can't move...

1244
01:27:23,404 --> 01:27:27,950
I'm at my limit! I don't think
I can hold him any longer.

1245
01:27:28,464 --> 01:27:30,883
You did well, Shikamaru.

1246
01:27:36,918 --> 01:27:38,795
Kakuzu! Lend me a hand!

1247
01:27:41,767 --> 01:27:44,361
Hey! Snap to it!

1248
01:27:47,217 --> 01:27:49,845
I told you to keep your wits
about you.

1249
01:28:13,329 --> 01:28:13,997
Shikamaru!

1250
01:28:14,205 --> 01:28:15,206
Are you all right?

1251
01:28:17,834 --> 01:28:20,712
Yeah. Now that leaves...

1252
01:28:22,338 --> 01:28:23,506
Only one more left, huh?

1253
01:28:24,549 --> 01:28:28,511
If you wanted help,
you should have said so sooner.

1254
01:28:29,086 --> 01:28:31,547
You were too slow, Kakuzu!

1255
01:28:32,015 --> 01:28:33,516
You did that on purpose, didn't you?!

1256
01:28:38,210 --> 01:28:41,129
You were the one who told me
to stay out of this at the beginning.

1257
01:28:41,408 --> 01:28:45,653
So are you really in
any position to complain?

1258
01:28:50,701 --> 01:28:55,341
Well, I did order you to hold back.

1259
01:28:56,001 --> 01:28:57,639
But that wasn't because

1260
01:28:57,664 --> 01:29:00,500
I was trying to make a fool of you
or disrespect you.

1261
01:29:01,419 --> 01:29:04,213
Well, never mind about that.
Anyway, bring my body over here.

1262
01:29:07,842 --> 01:29:12,175
Kakuzu...
Will you bring my body...?

1263
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:15,391
Come on Kakuzu, buddy.

1264
01:29:20,563 --> 01:29:23,941
Wha--?! Hey! Wait a minute!

1265
01:29:24,241 --> 01:29:26,368
See here, Kakuzu!
What about my body?

1266
01:29:26,765 --> 01:29:28,927
I thought I told you to bring
my body over here!

1267
01:29:29,548 --> 01:29:31,300
This is lighter.

1268
01:29:31,369 --> 01:29:33,373
That's not the issue now, is it?

1269
01:29:35,034 --> 01:29:36,285
Are you ignoring me? Hey!

1270
01:29:36,871 --> 01:29:39,082
Ouch... it hurts... hey!

1271
01:29:39,582 --> 01:29:42,293
Kakuzu, you're pulling my hair!
Stop that!

1272
01:29:42,877 --> 01:29:45,630
If you are hurting at all,
it should be in your neck.

1273
01:29:45,876 --> 01:29:46,877
You moron!

1274
01:29:47,209 --> 01:29:49,549
The pain in my neck isn't just a tickle!

1275
01:29:49,790 --> 01:29:53,252
It's excruciating!
This is more than just a simple injury.

1276
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:54,639
<i>That guy...</i>

1277
01:29:54,878 --> 01:29:57,923
<i>In that state, he's still alive!</i>

1278
01:29:58,601 --> 01:30:00,561
It hurts like crazy! See here!

1279
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:02,605
The nerve of you,
cutting off my head!

1280
01:30:02,647 --> 01:30:05,691
This is incredibly painful,
you idiot!

1281
01:30:06,192 --> 01:30:08,820
He may be immortal, but right now,
he can't do anything.

1282
01:30:09,448 --> 01:30:10,449
That's for sure.

1283
01:30:10,655 --> 01:30:13,116
So then, there's only one opponent left.

1284
01:30:13,658 --> 01:30:14,659
Yes...

1285
01:30:27,089 --> 01:30:28,090
Shikamaru!

1286
01:30:30,925 --> 01:30:32,885
<i>Shikamaru has really pushed himself
to his limit.</i>

1287
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:38,224
<i>Captain Asuma is injured too.</i>

1288
01:30:38,558 --> 01:30:40,059
<i>We are at an advantage in that</i>

1289
01:30:40,059 --> 01:30:42,854
<i>we've immobilized one of the Akatsuki, but...</i>

1290
01:30:42,854 --> 01:30:44,188
<i>On the other hand,</i>

1291
01:30:44,365 --> 01:30:46,909
<i>you could also say this gives us
the opportunity to escape.</i>

1292
01:31:18,456 --> 01:31:20,958
Since you've now asked me
to lend a hand,

1293
01:31:21,184 --> 01:31:23,186
I'm going to join in too.

1294
01:31:24,533 --> 01:31:26,087
I got it...

1295
01:31:31,591 --> 01:31:33,260
Ow! Ouch!

1296
01:31:33,654 --> 01:31:35,496
Hey, hold still, will you?

1297
01:31:36,542 --> 01:31:37,543
Okay, that should do it.

1298
01:31:43,329 --> 01:31:44,330
His head...

1299
01:31:45,867 --> 01:31:48,244
It's good to be whole again.

1300
01:31:48,878 --> 01:31:51,672
If you move around too much,
it'll come off again.

1301
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:56,802
Kakuzu, you're always such a nag.

1302
01:31:57,563 --> 01:32:00,732
What on earth... are we fighting?

1303
01:32:01,797 --> 01:32:04,216
<i>An immortal man...
and a man who possesses a jutsu</i>

1304
01:32:04,241 --> 01:32:06,618
<i>that can sew back together
a dismembered body...</i>

1305
01:32:07,104 --> 01:32:08,105
<i>Damn!</i>

1306
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:12,351
<i>It's just one thing after another.
How powerful are they?!</i>

1307
01:32:13,629 --> 01:32:18,700
Your fights, your complaining, and
your rituals are way too long.

1308
01:32:19,873 --> 01:32:21,917
You take care of the one with
the price on his head.

1309
01:32:22,411 --> 01:32:23,412
Izumo!

1310
01:32:23,538 --> 01:32:24,539
Got it!

1311
01:32:29,126 --> 01:32:29,957
Right!

1312
01:32:34,451 --> 01:32:36,328
<i>Water Style: Syrup Trap!</i>

1313
01:33:01,712 --> 01:33:03,714
I suppose you meant to grab
your opponent's attention

1314
01:33:03,739 --> 01:33:06,783
with that eye-catching aerial attack
to create an opening.

1315
01:33:07,331 --> 01:33:10,334
And then follow-up with
a land attack

1316
01:33:10,376 --> 01:33:14,255
by coordinating your movements
with this strange liquid, but...

1317
01:33:16,424 --> 01:33:18,009
I think it's half-baked.

1318
01:33:18,843 --> 01:33:20,136
There's too much wasted effort.

1319
01:33:21,345 --> 01:33:22,346
Now!

1320
01:33:37,721 --> 01:33:38,680
Well look at that...

1321
01:33:40,290 --> 01:33:41,583
You're mine!

1322
01:33:51,042 --> 01:33:52,043
Damn...!

1323
01:33:52,921 --> 01:33:53,922
Huh?!

1324
01:34:00,516 --> 01:34:01,517
So long.

1325
01:34:09,131 --> 01:34:10,257
Asuma!

1326
01:34:10,333 --> 01:34:11,418
Behind you!

1327
01:34:19,264 --> 01:34:20,912
It's the same moves
over and over again.

1328
01:34:38,782 --> 01:34:41,540
Not the same, you moron!

1329
01:34:51,102 --> 01:34:51,799
Damn!

1330
01:34:58,254 --> 01:34:59,338
Finally...

1331
01:34:59,904 --> 01:35:02,991
I finally get to taste that pain.

1332
01:35:11,412 --> 01:35:12,413
<i>Captain!</i>

1333
01:35:12,873 --> 01:35:13,916
<i>Damn!</i>

1334
01:35:15,167 --> 01:35:16,168
It's over.

1335
01:36:43,154 --> 01:36:44,614
I-It feels so good...

1336
01:36:57,311 --> 01:36:58,312
Asuma...

1337
01:37:05,827 --> 01:37:07,370
I'm finished.

1338
01:37:08,155 --> 01:37:10,074
I'll just be another minute.

1339
01:37:11,258 --> 01:37:13,594
Damn it...

1340
01:37:17,790 --> 01:37:19,500
Damn it...

1341
01:37:23,504 --> 01:37:25,172
You son of a bitch!

1342
01:37:42,022 --> 01:37:45,985
<i>Damn... I'm so powerless...</i>

1343
01:37:49,405 --> 01:37:50,406
<i>Feathers...?!</i>

1344
01:37:53,367 --> 01:37:54,493
What the hell?!

1345
01:37:57,453 --> 01:38:00,789
Do you think you can beat us
with crows?!

1346
01:38:01,115 --> 01:38:02,587
I wasn't born yesterday!

1347
01:38:07,871 --> 01:38:09,247
Blindfold!

1348
01:38:14,722 --> 01:38:15,848
<i>A back sword!</i>

1349
01:38:23,522 --> 01:38:24,523
Shikamaru!

1350
01:38:25,846 --> 01:38:26,847
We're here to help you.

1351
01:38:27,276 --> 01:38:28,277
Ino...

1352
01:38:28,986 --> 01:38:30,696
Take Shikamaru somewhere safe!

1353
01:38:30,937 --> 01:38:31,938
Yes!

1354
01:38:34,298 --> 01:38:35,924
Don't let your guard down, Choji!

1355
01:38:35,949 --> 01:38:36,950
Okay!

1356
01:38:47,212 --> 01:38:48,505
Reinforcements...

1357
01:38:56,931 --> 01:38:57,932
Are you okay?!

1358
01:38:58,807 --> 01:39:00,768
Forget me.
First... Captain Asuma...

1359
01:39:00,976 --> 01:39:02,102
Asuma-sensei!

1360
01:39:08,776 --> 01:39:10,444
<i>He still has a heartbeat!</i>

1361
01:39:11,153 --> 01:39:13,656
Choji! Take Asuma-sensei to
the Hidden Leaf Hospital right now!

1362
01:39:14,156 --> 01:39:16,075
Ino, you go along with him

1363
01:39:16,116 --> 01:39:18,535
and use your medical ninjutsu
to heal him as much as possible!

1364
01:39:18,619 --> 01:39:19,286
Hurry!

1365
01:39:19,459 --> 01:39:20,204
I got it!

1366
01:39:20,412 --> 01:39:21,126
Right!

1367
01:39:24,331 --> 01:39:26,458
I'm not giving up my bounty.

1368
01:39:26,835 --> 01:39:28,003
Damn...!

1369
01:39:31,090 --> 01:39:32,549
We'll hold them back.

1370
01:39:32,967 --> 01:39:38,430
You can struggle all you like,
but you'll be sacrificed to God...

1371
01:39:38,732 --> 01:39:39,858
That's why...

1372
01:39:40,265 --> 01:39:40,838
Huh?!

1373
01:39:41,558 --> 01:39:43,936
Can't you wait a little longer?!

1374
01:39:44,454 --> 01:39:46,915
Seriously, it was just getting good!

1375
01:39:53,023 --> 01:39:54,816
It's time to seal the Two-Tails...

1376
01:39:55,614 --> 01:39:58,033
Come right away!
This is the top priority.

1377
01:39:59,702 --> 01:40:03,789
See, I told you...
It's almost there!

1378
01:40:03,789 --> 01:40:04,915
Knock it off, Hidan!

1379
01:40:05,853 --> 01:40:07,647
<i>Are they communicating with someone?!</i>

1380
01:40:08,638 --> 01:40:09,426
Tsk...

1381
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:13,135
We'll be right back...
Be prepared!

1382
01:40:15,759 --> 01:40:17,052
Let's go, Hidan.

1383
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:21,457
Damn that pigheaded leader...
I'll curse him next time!

1384
01:40:21,932 --> 01:40:24,768
<i>What's going on?!
Are they pulling back...?!</i>

1385
01:40:27,284 --> 01:40:27,993
Sensei!

1386
01:40:28,397 --> 01:40:29,440
Asuma-sensei!

1387
01:40:29,756 --> 01:40:33,134
Ino, Choji! Hurry up and
get Asuma out of here! Now!

1388
01:40:33,694 --> 01:40:34,820
I'm telling you!

1389
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:39,022
Stay still until we get back!

1390
01:40:39,778 --> 01:40:42,114
He's about to die!

1391
01:40:45,111 --> 01:40:47,405
Later, losers!

1392
01:40:49,944 --> 01:40:51,695
Choji! Ino! Hurry up!

1393
01:40:51,818 --> 01:40:53,319
I'll use my medical ninjutsu!

1394
01:40:53,344 --> 01:40:54,345
Right!

1395
01:40:54,418 --> 01:40:56,253
No... more...

1396
01:40:58,436 --> 01:41:00,271
I'm done...

1397
01:41:01,474 --> 01:41:04,435
Even I know that...

1398
01:41:09,313 --> 01:41:11,899
You all must realize it, too.

1399
01:41:12,436 --> 01:41:14,355
Shut up! Don't speak!

1400
01:41:14,735 --> 01:41:15,444
Ino!

1401
01:41:15,486 --> 01:41:16,487
Okay!

1402
01:41:21,784 --> 01:41:22,743
Ino...

1403
01:41:23,577 --> 01:41:25,120
<i>They got four vital spots.</i>

1404
01:41:30,167 --> 01:41:33,545
<i>There's nothing more I can do...</i>

1405
01:41:44,913 --> 01:41:46,874
Now I think I finally realize...

1406
01:41:47,267 --> 01:41:50,813
why the Third did... what he did...

1407
01:41:54,733 --> 01:41:58,070
I... always took too long...

1408
01:41:59,189 --> 01:42:02,192
I have some last words...

1409
01:42:02,407 --> 01:42:09,665
I'd like to say...
to Ino, Choji and Shikamaru...

1410
01:42:10,168 --> 01:42:12,864
- Sensei, you shouldn't talk anymore!
- Choji!

1411
01:42:14,878 --> 01:42:15,879
Ino, you, too.

1412
01:42:26,014 --> 01:42:28,142
These are Asuma-sensei's last words...

1413
01:42:29,351 --> 01:42:30,435
Listen carefully.

1414
01:42:35,149 --> 01:42:36,150
Ino...

1415
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:37,401
Yes...

1416
01:42:39,486 --> 01:42:43,824
You're strong-willed, but dependable...

1417
01:42:47,452 --> 01:42:49,121
Both Choji and Shikamaru...

1418
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:54,042
They're clumsy...
so please take care of them...

1419
01:42:55,437 --> 01:42:56,253
Yes...

1420
01:42:57,753 --> 01:42:59,838
And don't let Sakura beat you...

1421
01:43:03,343 --> 01:43:06,263
Not in ninjutsu or romance.

1422
01:43:07,806 --> 01:43:08,807
Yes!

1423
01:43:13,604 --> 01:43:14,605
Choji...

1424
01:43:15,522 --> 01:43:18,400
You're a kind man who cares
for his comrades...

1425
01:43:19,651 --> 01:43:20,819
That's why...

1426
01:43:21,778 --> 01:43:24,114
you'll become a shinobi
who's stronger than anyone else.

1427
01:43:25,032 --> 01:43:27,951
Have more confidence... in yourself.

1428
01:43:28,577 --> 01:43:29,578
Okay...

1429
01:43:30,164 --> 01:43:34,001
And... you may need to diet a little.

1430
01:43:34,791 --> 01:43:37,377
That might be impossible... but I'll try!

1431
01:43:42,842 --> 01:43:44,677
And... Shikamaru...

1432
01:43:46,345 --> 01:43:51,516
You're so sharp...
and have great instincts as a shinobi...

1433
01:43:52,643 --> 01:43:54,811
You could definitely become Hokage.

1434
01:43:55,687 --> 01:44:01,693
Well... you're lazy...
so you'd probably hate it...

1435
01:44:06,615 --> 01:44:11,662
I never once... beat you... at shogi...

1436
01:44:12,817 --> 01:44:16,201
Oh yeah... about the "King"...

1437
01:44:21,213 --> 01:44:25,968
I'll tell you who the "King" is...
Lend me your ear.

1438
01:44:32,324 --> 01:44:35,777
Asuma... you...!
That's why...

1439
01:44:36,966 --> 01:44:40,552
I'm counting on you, Shikamaru...

1440
01:44:44,611 --> 01:44:46,071
It doesn't matter now, does it?

1441
01:44:47,155 --> 01:44:48,699
Even though I quit smoking...

1442
01:44:50,575 --> 01:44:52,786
They're in my pouch...

1443
01:44:53,739 --> 01:44:55,866
I want one last smoke...

1444
01:45:11,513 --> 01:45:13,348
<i>Oh! Sorry about that.</i>

1445
01:45:13,974 --> 01:45:17,102
<i>I'm Asuma Sarutobi,
and I'll be leading Team 10 from today.</i>

1446
01:45:17,978 --> 01:45:20,230
<i>It's not going to be easy,
so I hope you're all ready!</i>

1447
01:45:22,149 --> 01:45:26,820
<i>Oh, please don't cry!
All I said was that I'm going to be strict!</i>

1448
01:45:27,112 --> 01:45:29,156
<i>The smoke is getting in our eyes!</i>

1449
01:45:40,459 --> 01:45:44,463
<i>More rice! And four more orders
of barbecue ribs!</i>

1450
01:45:48,860 --> 01:45:50,218
<i>Thanks for waiting!</i>

1451
01:45:57,840 --> 01:46:02,220
<i>Choji, have you ever heard
of the word restraint?!</i>

1452
01:46:02,898 --> 01:46:04,733
<i>The bill went up to at least 3,000 ryo.</i>

1453
01:46:06,943 --> 01:46:09,571
<i>I'm saying this not because I'm stingy.</i>

1454
01:46:10,030 --> 01:46:12,699
<i>I'm just worried about you.</i>

1455
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:18,705
<i>If you keep eating like this,
eventually you're going to be fa--!</i>

1456
01:46:23,950 --> 01:46:25,813
<i>That word is taboo!</i>

1457
01:46:26,338 --> 01:46:29,508
<i>"Fa-" what?!
Is there something wrong, Shikamaru?!</i>

1458
01:46:29,716 --> 01:46:34,346
<i>O-Oh... H-He said
you can order the deluxe course meal.</i>

1459
01:46:34,429 --> 01:46:35,097
<i>What--?!</i>

1460
01:46:35,347 --> 01:46:37,891
<i>Wow! Really?!</i>

1461
01:46:37,916 --> 01:46:40,877
<i>Asuma-sensei, thank you for treating!</i>

1462
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:47,025
<i>Waiter, bring two deluxe course meals
with extra rice, please!</i>

1463
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:52,360
<i>I'm stuffed! I'm satisfied!</i>

1464
01:47:05,752 --> 01:47:06,753
<i>Here...</i>

1465
01:47:06,878 --> 01:47:07,879
<i>Oh...</i>

1466
01:47:08,797 --> 01:47:09,840
<i>Who are they for?!</i>

1467
01:47:09,923 --> 01:47:12,384
<i>Oh... nobody in particular...</i>

1468
01:47:13,885 --> 01:47:15,178
<i>S-See you later...</i>

1469
01:47:15,470 --> 01:47:17,764
<i>Say "Hi" to Kurenai-sensei for me!</i>

1470
01:47:17,889 --> 01:47:20,725
<i>What?! How did... you know that...?!</i>

1471
01:47:33,188 --> 01:47:35,816
<i>Shogi?! What a pain...</i>

1472
01:47:36,783 --> 01:47:39,137
<i>You can create a variety of situations</i>

1473
01:47:39,162 --> 01:47:41,831
<i>by utilizing the individual characteristics
of the various pieces.</i>

1474
01:47:42,622 --> 01:47:44,833
<i>It's the perfect game for
a person like you</i>

1475
01:47:44,875 --> 01:47:47,252
<i>who's good at coming up with strategies.</i>

1476
01:47:48,086 --> 01:47:50,547
<i>You should be able to figure out
most of the rules if you read this book.</i>

1477
01:47:51,381 --> 01:47:53,133
<i>The rest you'll pick up as you play.</i>

1478
01:47:53,633 --> 01:47:57,512
<i>It'll be troublesome, but...
I'll have it down in ten minutes.</i>

1479
01:48:02,434 --> 01:48:04,186
<i>I-I lost...</i>

1480
01:48:05,562 --> 01:48:08,315
<i>You don't have to go easy on me...
Seriously.</i>

1481
01:48:10,650 --> 01:48:13,987
<i>You're the only one who passed
the Chunin Exam this time.</i>

1482
01:48:14,779 --> 01:48:17,616
<i>As your Jonin team leader,
I'm very proud of you.</i>

1483
01:48:18,366 --> 01:48:22,037
<i>Ino and Choji,
you two keep working hard!</i>

1484
01:48:27,546 --> 01:48:30,466
<i>Choji, Ino, you guys did well...</i>

1485
01:48:31,216 --> 01:48:33,552
<i>And now along with Shikamaru
who passed last time,</i>

1486
01:48:33,673 --> 01:48:36,760
<i>all members of Team 10
are legitimate Chunin.</i>

1487
01:48:37,674 --> 01:48:41,761
<i>And now... I will no longer be
in charge of you guys.</i>

1488
01:48:42,849 --> 01:48:43,867
<i>From here on,</i>

1489
01:48:43,892 --> 01:48:48,063
<i>each of you will become a captain
and lead new teams.</i>

1490
01:48:49,481 --> 01:48:52,734
<i>These earrings are a present for you three. Congratulations!</i>

1491
01:48:54,194 --> 01:48:57,989
<i>Don't ever forget that
you were members of Team 10!</i>

1492
01:49:30,647 --> 01:49:32,357
Sensei!

1493
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:15,317
He died as a true shinobi.

1494
01:50:44,179 --> 01:50:47,390
After all... I hate cigarettes...

1495
01:50:49,976 --> 01:50:54,397
The smoke... gets in my eyes...

1496
01:53:05,069 --> 01:53:08,072
Contact the relevant parties
about the funeral.

1497
01:53:09,115 --> 01:53:10,283
I'll tell Kurenai...

1498
01:53:10,366 --> 01:53:12,035
No... I'll do it.

1499
01:53:13,018 --> 01:53:14,227
I'll tell her.

1500
01:53:15,413 --> 01:53:17,665
I have a message for her
from Captain Asuma...

1501
01:53:28,843 --> 01:53:29,844
Yes!

1502
01:53:30,011 --> 01:53:33,181
Yeah! I'm kind of getting
the hang of it!

1503
01:53:39,412 --> 01:53:44,000
I see... So that was
your idea, huh?

1504
01:53:44,945 --> 01:53:46,655
You formed the Rasengan
by using a clone

1505
01:53:46,903 --> 01:53:53,660
to handle the change in form
while you released the chakra.

1506
01:53:54,035 --> 01:53:56,746
Right! I just needed a third clone

1507
01:53:57,038 --> 01:54:00,834
to handle the Wind Nature Transformation.

1508
01:54:01,292 --> 01:54:04,337
If I can't look left and right by myself...

1509
01:54:04,546 --> 01:54:06,798
then I just needed to create clones

1510
01:54:06,898 --> 01:54:11,569
to look left and right and
divide up the responsibility!

1511
01:54:12,425 --> 01:54:15,970
So my shadow clone stunt earlier
gave you a hint, huh?

1512
01:54:16,817 --> 01:54:19,487
<i>That being said,
only Naruto has both the chakra</i>

1513
01:54:19,512 --> 01:54:22,015
<i>and the skill with shadow clones
for that method to work.</i>

1514
01:54:23,099 --> 01:54:24,351
<i>I couldn't do it like that.</i>

1515
01:54:24,691 --> 01:54:27,277
<i>I bet even the Fourth Hokage couldn't.</i>

1516
01:54:28,111 --> 01:54:29,571
<i>But he...</i>

1517
01:54:30,798 --> 01:54:32,257
Just what I'd expect

1518
01:54:32,282 --> 01:54:34,826
from the Number One
Most Unpredictable Ninja, Naruto.

1519
01:54:35,785 --> 01:54:37,203
I'm not sure how to say it...

1520
01:54:38,162 --> 01:54:41,624
I've really started to
take a liking to you!

1521
01:54:44,836 --> 01:54:48,006
Don't say weird stuff like that
out of nowhere, you creep!

1522
01:54:48,172 --> 01:54:50,799
The jutsu I went to the trouble of creating
got messed up because you freaked me out!

1523
01:54:50,824 --> 01:54:52,576
Uhh, I didn't mean it like that...

1524
01:54:52,635 --> 01:54:54,053
Whoa, stay back!

1525
01:54:54,345 --> 01:54:55,763
I don't know quite how to say it...

1526
01:54:55,871 --> 01:54:56,782
Well...

1527
01:54:56,872 --> 01:54:58,665
No!

1528
01:54:59,517 --> 01:55:00,560
<i>For crying out loud...</i>

1529
01:55:01,102 --> 01:55:03,021
<i>What are those two doing...?</i>

1530
01:55:04,522 --> 01:55:05,523
I have a message for you.

1531
01:55:05,773 --> 01:55:06,816
Just a minute...

1532
01:55:11,074 --> 01:55:12,075
What's going on?

1533
01:55:18,828 --> 01:55:19,829
Kakashi-senpai!

1534
01:55:20,705 --> 01:55:23,166
We must stop the training for now
and head back to the village!

1535
01:55:23,333 --> 01:55:24,751
What?!

1536
01:55:38,433 --> 01:55:39,934
Asuma Sarutobi...

1537
01:55:40,475 --> 01:55:41,476
... is dead.
