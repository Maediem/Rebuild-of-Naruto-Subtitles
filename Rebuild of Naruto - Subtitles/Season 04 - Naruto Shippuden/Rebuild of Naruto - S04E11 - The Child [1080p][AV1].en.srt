1
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:32,490
I'm counting on you.
Take it to the Hokage.

2
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,470
You're so reckless...!

3
00:00:53,558 --> 00:00:55,790
Don't get so upset...

4
00:00:55,815 --> 00:00:57,358
And don't talk back!

5
00:00:58,845 --> 00:01:03,343
<i>Scrapes and bruises...
these injuries aren't too serious...</i>

6
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,774
<i>The real problem is this arm.</i>

7
00:01:06,606 --> 00:01:08,483
<i>It's broken in several places.</i>

8
00:01:17,455 --> 00:01:20,208
<i>His body isn't able to withstand
his jutsu.</i>

9
00:02:25,652 --> 00:02:26,653
I see...

10
00:02:27,237 --> 00:02:29,781
So Hidan and Kakuzu are dead.

11
00:02:29,806 --> 00:02:33,601
Yes. It appears Naruto's team killed them.

12
00:02:34,753 --> 00:02:35,921
Oh...?

13
00:02:36,904 --> 00:02:40,282
We thought they would take down
another Akatsuki

14
00:02:40,307 --> 00:02:41,725
if we let them live...

15
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,747
Seems like it went quite well.

16
00:02:45,343 --> 00:02:47,178
Not bad at all.

17
00:02:47,372 --> 00:02:50,566
I'm sure even the Akatsuki
would never have expected

18
00:02:50,591 --> 00:02:55,297
to lose two of their members
at once.

19
00:02:58,316 --> 00:03:01,694
Still, they now have the Two-Tails.

20
00:03:02,423 --> 00:03:06,844
Maybe we should push
a little harder to weaken them.

21
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,461
How is that child?

22
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:11,479
Yes.

23
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,490
I'm planning a final test
in a few days.

24
00:03:15,746 --> 00:03:19,099
But judging from the data,
I'm certain there is no mistake.

25
00:03:19,525 --> 00:03:21,485
I'm looking forward to it.

26
00:03:23,213 --> 00:03:25,883
We're almost at the final step.

27
00:03:26,282 --> 00:03:31,579
But for that to happen,
we need one more pawn.

28
00:03:34,705 --> 00:03:38,125
Say, Kabuto. That woman...

29
00:03:38,515 --> 00:03:41,332
Would you bring her here?

30
00:03:44,463 --> 00:03:45,965
That woman?

31
00:05:24,766 --> 00:05:26,200
All right, done.

32
00:05:26,554 --> 00:05:28,264
Now you just have to take it easy.

33
00:05:28,393 --> 00:05:29,894
Thanks, Sakura.

34
00:05:31,116 --> 00:05:32,243
Say, Naruto.

35
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:35,770
This new jutsu, use it only
when absolutely necessary.

36
00:05:36,353 --> 00:05:37,980
Do not use it too often!

37
00:05:38,262 --> 00:05:42,025
Don't worry.
As long as you're around to heal me-

38
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,093
I'm not talking about that!

39
00:05:44,362 --> 00:05:47,991
Medical ninjutsu can't heal
everything instantly!

40
00:06:00,989 --> 00:06:05,952
But this kind of makes me happy.

41
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,201
Huh?

42
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:11,512
I feel like you and I are
getting closer to Sasuke.

43
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:16,919
Honestly...

44
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,944
Quite the welcome... Guren.

45
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:27,905
Oh, it's just you, Kabuto.
I thought it was an intruder.

46
00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:31,263
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

47
00:07:32,022 --> 00:07:33,273
Of course not.

48
00:07:33,809 --> 00:07:36,979
Besides, I wouldn't want
someone who'd die so easily

49
00:07:37,065 --> 00:07:40,068
to be standing beside
Lord Orochimaru!

50
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,039
An order from Lord Orochimaru...

51
00:08:13,064 --> 00:08:14,524
From Lord Orochimaru...?

52
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:26,398
That is the order of Lord Orochimaru.

53
00:08:34,802 --> 00:08:36,262
Is that so...?

54
00:08:36,943 --> 00:08:41,805
From Lord Orochimaru himself!
So he hasn't forgotten about me!

55
00:08:42,384 --> 00:08:44,970
When I was sent to take care
of this remote hideout,

56
00:08:44,995 --> 00:08:47,247
I was sure I had been forsaken.

57
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,930
Did I say something funny, Guren?

58
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:53,173
Humph... All we have to do is
make them kill each other.

59
00:08:53,687 --> 00:08:56,688
The sound of bones being crushed!
Piercing screams!

60
00:08:56,713 --> 00:08:58,924
Just the thought of it
gives me a thrill.

61
00:08:59,964 --> 00:09:03,750
It's to select members for
Lord Orochimaru's next operation...

62
00:09:03,933 --> 00:09:06,519
There's no point if they all die.

63
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,840
Yes, I know that!

64
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:13,353
Men! You all heard that, didn't you?

65
00:09:13,382 --> 00:09:16,826
If you want to leave this hideout
and breathe free air again, you must win!

66
00:09:17,295 --> 00:09:22,842
Then, you will be able to work
for Lord Orochimaru under my command!

67
00:09:22,867 --> 00:09:25,036
You are such fortunate men!

68
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,918
Now, begin!

69
00:09:47,726 --> 00:09:50,437
Fight all you want!

70
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:06,634
Enter!

71
00:10:11,018 --> 00:10:13,520
A shinobi bird sent by
the ANBU Black Ops has just arrived.

72
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,367
Where is Kakashi?

73
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,287
He is probably with Naruto.

74
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:23,472
Regarding that matter, huh...?

75
00:10:24,075 --> 00:10:26,630
Tell him to see me when he's done.

76
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,629
Have they tracked down
Orochimaru's hideout?

77
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:35,259
No... It says they nearly had him
when they were suddenly attacked.

78
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:39,998
We must select members for
a search team to be sent off immediately.

79
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:40,994
Yes, ma'am.

80
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,907
There's likely no traces left of
the ANBU Black Ops

81
00:10:47,235 --> 00:10:48,904
who sent this message...

82
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:54,779
The ANBU have a rule:
"When you die, leave no corpse behind."

83
00:10:55,577 --> 00:10:59,790
He can't possibly rest in peace
unless we discover that hideout.

84
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,494
Here you go!

85
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,734
Miso-flavored pork bone stock
with roast pork...

86
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,725
The two thick slices of
roast pork are on the house.

87
00:11:09,675 --> 00:11:10,884
Thank you!

88
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,247
Just what I've been waiting for.

89
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:16,591
Oh... It's hot!

90
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:20,990
Be careful.
Our ramen stays hot until the very end.

91
00:11:21,523 --> 00:11:24,067
It's just not easy eating
with my left hand.

92
00:11:30,545 --> 00:11:32,798
Here, lend me those chopsticks.

93
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,967
<i>D-Don't tell me, Sakura...
You're going to feed me...?</i>

94
00:11:39,077 --> 00:11:39,954
Oh!

95
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,142
Say ahh...!

96
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:46,088
This isn't the time for you to interfere!

97
00:11:46,113 --> 00:11:46,701
What...?!

98
00:11:47,554 --> 00:11:48,555
Yo...

99
00:11:48,682 --> 00:11:50,976
Not "What"!

100
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:51,651
Huh...?!

101
00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:53,215
<i>What's going on?</i>

102
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:56,606
Just when Sakura was
about to feed me!

103
00:11:56,631 --> 00:11:59,092
When a friend is in trouble,
you must help him.

104
00:11:59,488 --> 00:12:02,532
That's what a true friend does
according to this book...

105
00:12:02,557 --> 00:12:06,853
Forget what's in your book
and read the room for once!

106
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,395
How can I read something
that I cannot see?

107
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,063
You're such a pain!

108
00:12:13,545 --> 00:12:15,631
What's with all this noise?

109
00:12:16,244 --> 00:12:17,370
Kakashi-sensei!

110
00:12:19,146 --> 00:12:20,814
Naruto can't eat with
his right hand...

111
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:23,550
and we're having a little disagreement
over who's going to feed him.

112
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:27,675
Here, eat!

113
00:12:28,961 --> 00:12:30,880
So in the end, it's Kakashi-sensei?!

114
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:34,249
By the way, Kakashi-sensei,
I'm surprised that

115
00:12:34,274 --> 00:12:38,320
you haven't landed in the hospital
after a huge mission like that.

116
00:12:40,305 --> 00:12:43,003
So that's how people see me now...?

117
00:12:43,967 --> 00:12:45,218
What a shock...

118
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:51,021
Well, this time, I didn't need to use
my Mangekyo Sharingan, you see.

119
00:12:54,877 --> 00:12:59,757
If you all hadn't arrived in time,
I would have used it again for sure.

120
00:13:00,619 --> 00:13:03,997
<i>Sorry... We're late.</i>

121
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,685
Then, just as you imagined,
I'd probably be lying in bed now.

122
00:13:21,723 --> 00:13:25,977
Naruto...
You have definitely gotten stronger.

123
00:13:27,302 --> 00:13:30,388
You're equal to me,
or even stronger...

124
00:13:37,671 --> 00:13:42,008
But keep in mind that the greater
the jutsu you use,

125
00:13:42,229 --> 00:13:45,440
the greater the risk to you.

126
00:13:47,308 --> 00:13:48,309
Yeah...

127
00:13:50,298 --> 00:13:55,178
<i>Kakashi... This new jutsu...
the Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken.</i>

128
00:13:55,203 --> 00:13:56,955
<i>Forbid Naruto from using it again.</i>

129
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,496
<i>If he continues using this new jutsu,</i>

130
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,460
<i>Naruto will lose his ability
to mold chakra.</i>

131
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,919
<i>If the cells are disconnected
from the body's chakra network,</i>

132
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:10,342
<i>even my medical skills won't cure him.</i>

133
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,877
<i>Be certain to emphasize
that to Naruto.</i>

134
00:14:19,664 --> 00:14:20,749
Naruto...

135
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:22,902
That new jutsu of yours...

136
00:14:22,938 --> 00:14:24,148
Kakashi-sensei...

137
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:29,995
I know myself best!

138
00:14:30,562 --> 00:14:32,689
I'm going to be the Hokage one day,
you know.

139
00:14:32,714 --> 00:14:36,301
I'm really powerful,
so there's nothing to worry about!

140
00:14:37,971 --> 00:14:39,973
I shouldn't have bothered
worrying about him.

141
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:47,678
I guess these should be the members
of the search team.

142
00:14:48,131 --> 00:14:49,341
Isn't Kakashi here yet?

143
00:14:49,744 --> 00:14:52,647
He's been notified. He's probably
got his hands full with Naruto.

144
00:14:55,547 --> 00:14:59,176
I wonder if Kakashi will be able
to talk him into it.

145
00:15:00,295 --> 00:15:02,255
We'd better put a guard on him
for a while.

146
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,242
He's sure to start training
on that new jutsu.

147
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,823
I can't just let that slide.

148
00:15:11,315 --> 00:15:13,734
Yo! It's been a while...

149
00:15:13,909 --> 00:15:17,162
Weren't you investigating
the Akatsuki?

150
00:15:17,364 --> 00:15:20,031
I stopped by because
I was a little worried.

151
00:15:20,243 --> 00:15:23,914
Tell me the details on what
you said just now.

152
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,009
Thanks for the ramen, Pops!

153
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,827
Give Kakashi-sensei the bill!

154
00:15:28,852 --> 00:15:29,345
What?!

155
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:30,413
Thanks...!

156
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,916
Thank you.

157
00:15:32,008 --> 00:15:33,426
Wait, what...?

158
00:15:37,761 --> 00:15:41,515
So, you've finally learned
to do the Shadow Clone...

159
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,205
What...? What's going on?

160
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:54,787
Then... Let me see how much
you've improved.

161
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,872
- Here I come, Big Brother Naruto.
- Here I come, Big Brother Naruto.

162
00:15:58,409 --> 00:16:01,203
- <i>Sexy Two-girl Jutsu!</i>
- <i>Sexy Two-girl Jutsu!</i>

163
00:16:01,738 --> 00:16:04,565
Whoa...!
So that's your new move?!

164
00:16:11,241 --> 00:16:13,243
What do you think, big brother?!

165
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,846
The two girls are...

166
00:16:21,771 --> 00:16:24,732
Are you all right, Konohamaru?!

167
00:16:28,212 --> 00:16:30,119
Hey, Moegi, what are you doing?

168
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:33,186
What are you doing in
front of us ladies...?!

169
00:16:35,274 --> 00:16:36,658
<i>This is like déjà vu...</i>

170
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,153
You two!

171
00:16:39,323 --> 00:16:42,285
This isn't what you always do
when you get together, is it?

172
00:16:42,381 --> 00:16:45,786
W-Well, this jutsu is
a good diversionary tactic...

173
00:16:45,811 --> 00:16:47,310
Besides, you could say this is
a serious competition

174
00:16:47,335 --> 00:16:48,419
between the two of us.

175
00:16:48,993 --> 00:16:51,370
You two shouldn't be
escalating things like this.

176
00:16:51,523 --> 00:16:53,999
You two are the only ones who
would fall for a jutsu like this!

177
00:16:54,024 --> 00:16:55,770
You guys...

178
00:16:56,077 --> 00:16:58,413
You seem to be having fun, as usual.

179
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,311
Oh! It's the Pervy Sage!

180
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:06,275
Here's another one
that would fall for it...

181
00:17:06,683 --> 00:17:10,353
Oh... You're looking better
than I expected, Naruto!

182
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:13,507
Oh, well this is nothing.

183
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:18,458
Idiot! The bones haven't healed yet!

184
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,521
You haven't changed at all.

185
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,641
So, was Naruto convinced?

186
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,361
He has matured.

187
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,872
I left the rest up to that man...

188
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:42,516
That is for the best...
There's something I want you to do.

189
00:17:46,463 --> 00:17:47,589
It's a search mission...

190
00:17:48,273 --> 00:17:50,150
It hasn't been confirmed yet,

191
00:17:50,222 --> 00:17:54,476
but the ANBU Black Ops have discovered
what could be Orochimaru's hideout.

192
00:17:54,655 --> 00:17:56,817
However, the operative
has been killed

193
00:17:56,842 --> 00:18:00,595
and the map he sent me only
shows the general area.

194
00:18:01,405 --> 00:18:02,615
I see.

195
00:18:03,469 --> 00:18:06,084
Do you have a problem with
the members that I have chosen?

196
00:18:06,978 --> 00:18:08,104
I'm impressed...

197
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:11,800
You have chosen the best possible
members for this search team.

198
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,978
Enter.

199
00:18:26,683 --> 00:18:29,310
Lord Orochimaru,
it's time for your medicine.

200
00:18:29,627 --> 00:18:31,837
Oh, you're back...?

201
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:33,239
Yes. I returned a little while ago.

202
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,032
How's Guren?

203
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,657
The same...

204
00:18:37,111 --> 00:18:38,738
I just don't understand why

205
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,907
you make such a fuss
over that woman.

206
00:18:42,384 --> 00:18:45,137
You've never liked her, have you?

207
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,673
She may not look it, but at one
time, she was my top candidate.

208
00:18:51,152 --> 00:18:54,280
Of course, time was not on her side

209
00:18:54,305 --> 00:18:56,933
and Genyumaru was chosen instead.

210
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,804
I am aware of that.

211
00:18:59,197 --> 00:19:03,368
When Sasuke achieves
the skills he needs...

212
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,911
The time for my reanimation
will be near.

213
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:10,109
When that happens, both the Akatsuki
and the Leaf will be a hindrance...

214
00:19:10,672 --> 00:19:14,652
Our current operation is preparation
for when that happens.

215
00:19:15,302 --> 00:19:19,159
Lord Orochimaru, it's because of
the plans scheduled after your reanimation

216
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,439
that I believe there are too many
flaws in that woman's character...

217
00:19:23,261 --> 00:19:29,307
This job can be carried out by
no one but Guren.

218
00:19:31,465 --> 00:19:34,099
Speed up that test...

219
00:19:34,953 --> 00:19:37,330
Yes, sir...
We may be able to leave today.

220
00:19:39,114 --> 00:19:39,902
I'm coming in.

221
00:20:18,172 --> 00:20:21,941
Tell me... Do you like red camellias?
White camellias?

222
00:20:22,683 --> 00:20:26,062
Camellias don't lose their petals;
the whole flower falls off.

223
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:31,117
You can get oil from the nuts, and
the tree makes very good charcoal.

224
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:34,814
Don't come in here...
Go back!

225
00:20:35,763 --> 00:20:36,722
Go back?

226
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:40,065
I wonder where I can go back to?

227
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,866
Where should I go back to?

228
00:20:42,382 --> 00:20:45,051
Is this where I'm supposed
to return to?

229
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,155
But, something's not right.

230
00:20:49,704 --> 00:20:52,498
This is not the place where
I'm supposed to return to.

231
00:20:54,244 --> 00:20:57,413
That's right...
You wouldn't know that, would you?

232
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:00,458
Say, do you have somewhere
to go back to?

233
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,319
Such a place does not exist for me.

234
00:21:05,481 --> 00:21:10,069
So here you are, Yuukimaru...
It's time to leave.

235
00:21:10,473 --> 00:21:11,432
All right.

236
00:21:11,587 --> 00:21:12,922
Sorry to bother you.

237
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:20,405
See you again, Sasuke...

238
00:21:22,446 --> 00:21:24,782
<i>In order to carry out
Lord Orochimaru's plan,</i>

239
00:21:24,905 --> 00:21:27,616
<i>it is necessary to draw out
Yuukimaru's power...</i>

240
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,790
<i>I must produce results with these tests
before handing him to Guren.</i>

241
00:21:32,701 --> 00:21:35,078
<i>I'll use whatever measures
are necessary to do it...</i>

242
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,505
You really can't tell until you try it.

243
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:39,127
Huh?

244
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:45,423
You can't tell where to tie gaiters until
you've wrapped them around a few times...

245
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:50,267
You're supposed to be able
to tell when you put it on.

246
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,911
But you don't know until
you finish wrapping it around.

247
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,024
Let's go.

248
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,322
It's almost time.

249
00:22:13,974 --> 00:22:15,058
Kakashi-sensei...

250
00:22:15,362 --> 00:22:16,696
Is everyone here?

251
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,671
I'm sure you've already heard
about our mission.

252
00:22:19,807 --> 00:22:24,144
Yes... It is to pinpoint the hideout
that's thought to belong to Orochimaru.

253
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:29,473
Yes... With all of your abilities,
it should not be very difficult to do.

254
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:37,877
First, I'll get a head start and
release my parasitic insects

255
00:22:37,902 --> 00:22:40,571
to search out the area where chakra
is in the highest concentration.

256
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:47,574
Akamaru and I will do the rest!
His nose will pinpoint their hideout.

257
00:22:48,983 --> 00:22:50,818
Once we find the hideout,

258
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:54,722
I should search out the enemies' chakra
using my Byakugan, right?

259
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:56,833
I'm counting on you...

260
00:22:57,245 --> 00:23:01,332
If that is really
Orochimaru's hideout,

261
00:23:01,357 --> 00:23:03,776
there's a chance that Sasuke is there...?

262
00:23:04,312 --> 00:23:05,272
Yes...

263
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,440
Does Naruto know that?!

264
00:23:07,607 --> 00:23:09,693
That's a silly question.

265
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:15,929
If he knew that,
he'd never sit still.

266
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,979
That's true.

267
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:22,234
Yes. Naruto hasn't been told
about this mission...

268
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:29,991
<i>Orochimaru, huh...</i>

269
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:31,952
<i>Multiple Legs Barrage!</i>

270
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,083
<i>I swore to myself that</i>

271
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:41,207
<i>I'd never let Akamaru
go through anything like that again.</i>

272
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:43,922
<i>Akamaru...</i>

273
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,091
Kiba, what are you thinking?

274
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:49,553
Well, I was just thinking about
our mission to rescue Sasuke.

275
00:23:49,879 --> 00:23:53,165
But this time... if it's really
going to be at Orochimaru's hideout,

276
00:23:53,357 --> 00:23:56,068
maybe the same type of people
will appear...

277
00:23:56,615 --> 00:23:58,659
What? Getting nervous?

278
00:23:58,684 --> 00:24:00,478
Just the opposite, Kakashi-sensei!

279
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:05,251
In addition to Shikamaru, word has it that
even Naruto beat the Akatsuki.

280
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,195
I've been training hard too.

281
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,222
I have to show the others
that I won't lose either!

282
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:13,869
Then I'll have to demonstrate
the results of my training too.

283
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,036
Huh?

284
00:24:15,171 --> 00:24:17,840
That's because unlike you guys,

285
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:21,960
I've rarely been on missions consistently
with the same members.

286
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:26,339
Are you still bitter because you
couldn't be a part of the last mission?

287
00:24:26,563 --> 00:24:31,193
That plus the fact that Naruto didn't
even recognize his comrade's face.

288
00:24:31,373 --> 00:24:33,917
Of course, Naruto wouldn't
recognize you!

289
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:36,892
Your face is practically
covered in that get-up!

290
00:24:36,966 --> 00:24:40,428
That shouldn't matter...
among comrades.

291
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:44,232
C'mon, let's all do our best together.

292
00:24:45,691 --> 00:24:47,068
<i>I won't lose either!</i>

293
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,530
<i>I've done my best
so that Naruto will acknowledge me.</i>

294
00:24:51,175 --> 00:24:54,309
<i>Before I knew it, they've all
become so strong and reliable.</i>

295
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,661
<i>Even him.</i>

296
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,252
Tsunade told me about it.

297
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,259
You've perfected
the Wind Style: Rasen-shuriken...

298
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,037
Well done!

299
00:25:09,823 --> 00:25:10,907
It's no good...

300
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,962
Huh? What do you mean?

301
00:25:14,077 --> 00:25:17,720
You have accomplished a feat not
even the Fourth Hokage was able to.

302
00:25:17,941 --> 00:25:19,994
Have more confidence in yourself.

303
00:25:20,387 --> 00:25:23,557
If this is the result,
then it's no good.

304
00:25:25,605 --> 00:25:28,316
I mastered an instant kill jutsu.

305
00:25:28,413 --> 00:25:31,515
But... it's pointless
if I'm only going to waste

306
00:25:31,709 --> 00:25:33,877
my chakra on top of getting injured!

307
00:25:34,268 --> 00:25:35,269
I see...

308
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:38,806
This isn't a jutsu that can
be used over and over.

309
00:25:39,062 --> 00:25:44,634
I have to learn a couple jutsu that
use less chakra but are effective.

310
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:54,919
Is that what you were
worrying about?

311
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:58,056
In that case, all you have to do
is train some more.

312
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:01,935
At your current level, there are sure
to be other jutsu that you can master.

313
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,428
What do you say?

314
00:26:03,494 --> 00:26:06,288
Will you come with me on another journey
to gather writing material?

315
00:26:07,346 --> 00:26:10,849
I'm asking you if you have the will
to train with me once more.

316
00:26:11,345 --> 00:26:13,305
Yeah! Take me with you!

317
00:26:13,695 --> 00:26:17,338
All right. Then we'll leave at once!

318
00:26:17,705 --> 00:26:19,064
Where are we going?

319
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,304
First, we must heal that arm!

320
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:24,682
Shall we visit a hot spring?

321
00:26:25,554 --> 00:26:27,075
What do you mean, "hot spring"?!

322
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:30,505
I can see exactly where your thoughts
are headed, you Pervy Sage!

323
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:35,176
But I found a mixed hot spring and
that's good for healing broken bones...

324
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:37,929
See, that is your motive, after all!

325
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:42,726
Yes, well that's too bad.
Maybe I'll invite Sakura, then.

326
00:26:43,013 --> 00:26:44,014
What?!

327
00:26:44,231 --> 00:26:48,444
Yes, yes, I'll go.
Wait for me!

328
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,063
Come on, take me with you.

329
00:26:50,088 --> 00:26:53,634
I'm injured, you know...
Don't leave me behind, Pervy Sage!

330
00:26:58,361 --> 00:26:59,326
This is...

331
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:01,312
the ANBU Black Ops who
sent the message...

332
00:27:04,074 --> 00:27:06,201
What is it? You sense something?

333
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:09,170
This is more than just a sense,
right, Akamaru?

334
00:27:10,189 --> 00:27:11,315
The smell of death.

335
00:27:11,635 --> 00:27:14,012
There're quite a few dead bodies
up ahead.

336
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:18,237
My nose is pretty sharp,
but... Which way?

337
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:19,780
This way.

338
00:27:31,292 --> 00:27:32,585
Proceed with caution.

339
00:27:42,347 --> 00:27:43,253
This is...!

340
00:27:46,335 --> 00:27:48,129
H-Help...

341
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,280
A Curse Mark!

342
00:27:51,249 --> 00:27:54,294
This guy has Orochimaru's Curse Mark!

343
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:00,965
Without a doubt,
this is Orochimaru's hideout.

344
00:28:01,501 --> 00:28:04,421
However...
What happened here?!

345
00:28:05,174 --> 00:28:06,634
Faint traces of chakra!

346
00:28:07,698 --> 00:28:10,576
One... two... There are so many!

347
00:28:10,954 --> 00:28:12,497
Let's go, Kakashi-sensei!

348
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,585
We have no time to waste.

349
00:28:16,462 --> 00:28:18,714
Be wary of traps. Let's go.

350
00:28:22,943 --> 00:28:23,913
How terrible...

351
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:25,372
What is this?!

352
00:28:25,602 --> 00:28:28,564
Looks like they fought each other.

353
00:28:28,777 --> 00:28:29,945
A split in the ranks?

354
00:28:30,605 --> 00:28:33,065
We'd better find out from them.

355
00:28:35,617 --> 00:28:36,585
What's the matter, Akamaru?!

356
00:28:37,327 --> 00:28:37,991
Damn it!

357
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:51,921
We'd have been in big trouble if
Akamaru hadn't found an escape route.

358
00:28:53,536 --> 00:28:55,829
Heh heh, Good boy, Akamaru!

359
00:28:57,246 --> 00:28:59,873
But to think they laid a trap.

360
00:29:00,089 --> 00:29:01,507
I don't think so.

361
00:29:02,412 --> 00:29:06,375
I don't think the enemy
knew that we were close.

362
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:10,299
That trap was set to
destroy any evidence;

363
00:29:10,324 --> 00:29:12,618
to destroy the hideout itself.

364
00:29:13,071 --> 00:29:14,948
But there were survivors...!

365
00:29:15,091 --> 00:29:17,134
Yeah... What a cruel thing to do.

366
00:29:17,516 --> 00:29:20,227
I can't forgive him,
that Orochimaru!

367
00:29:24,322 --> 00:29:25,627
Quit wasting time!

368
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:33,087
We've succeeded in our mission
to locate Orochimaru's hideout, but...

369
00:29:33,479 --> 00:29:35,731
We can't say we succeeded.

370
00:29:37,426 --> 00:29:40,512
Because we can't return
to the village

371
00:29:40,537 --> 00:29:42,956
without any information
about Orochimaru.

372
00:29:43,113 --> 00:29:45,074
He's right, Kakashi-sensei!

373
00:29:45,215 --> 00:29:48,510
Um... We can still gather information.

374
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:52,290
The enemy set a time device here...

375
00:29:52,907 --> 00:29:56,160
In other words, there are people
who left this site.

376
00:29:59,844 --> 00:30:03,723
You're right. The enemy who
has information is still close by.

377
00:30:04,146 --> 00:30:06,398
Then it's decided!
Let's pursue them.

378
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:08,251
Leave the enemy search to me.

379
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:12,652
This is a specialty of
my Parasitic Insects.

380
00:30:12,804 --> 00:30:17,059
Hey! Don't forget
my Akamaru's sharp nose!

381
00:30:17,445 --> 00:30:19,155
E-Even I...!

382
00:30:26,314 --> 00:30:28,524
Where are we headed?

383
00:30:29,204 --> 00:30:31,748
Heh, isn't it Orochimaru's hideout?

384
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:35,252
Do you understand what
that means?

385
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,602
<i>S-Stop... Please stop!</i>

386
00:30:44,868 --> 00:30:46,495
There's no guarantee we're safe

387
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,522
if he messes around
with our bodies again.

388
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:50,141
That's for sure...

389
00:30:50,192 --> 00:30:54,988
B-But I'm scared of Orochimaru...
I can't defy him...

390
00:30:55,407 --> 00:30:57,409
Right now, it's only that woman.

391
00:30:59,049 --> 00:31:00,467
Y-You're right...

392
00:31:01,085 --> 00:31:04,255
If we kill that one woman,
we'll be free!

393
00:31:04,649 --> 00:31:05,441
Yeah!

394
00:31:05,701 --> 00:31:06,994
Let's kill her!

395
00:31:07,803 --> 00:31:09,554
Who said you can take a break?

396
00:31:11,793 --> 00:31:12,794
I did!

397
00:31:14,818 --> 00:31:16,111
One, two, three...

398
00:31:16,136 --> 00:31:18,305
We won't listen to you anymore.

399
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:23,081
We'll kill you and go free!
It's decided!

400
00:31:23,453 --> 00:31:29,084
Ten, eleven, twelve... sixteen of you.

401
00:31:29,378 --> 00:31:32,673
Are you scared...?!
Well, are you?

402
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,548
Fool.

403
00:31:34,854 --> 00:31:39,150
You think you can beat
all of us here?! Woman!

404
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:46,197
How pitiful! You're not able to
judge your opponent's strength!

405
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,158
<i>Crystal Style:</i>

406
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,365
<i>Crystal Prison!</i>

407
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,574
My insects have detected the enemy.

408
00:32:01,917 --> 00:32:04,230
Well, since they don't even know

409
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,174
if they're a match for their opponent...

410
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,969
They're not just weak, they're being stupid.

411
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:14,630
Are you trying to say you're smarter?

412
00:32:20,527 --> 00:32:22,821
What will you do? Are you coming?

413
00:32:23,072 --> 00:32:24,108
I-I...

414
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:26,069
Of course! We're coming.

415
00:32:26,641 --> 00:32:32,063
We didn't run away...
We just wanted to avoid a fight.

416
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:41,626
<i>I can't face Lord Orochimaru
if I don't have any henchmen.</i>

417
00:32:42,684 --> 00:32:44,602
I pledge my loyalty.

418
00:32:44,967 --> 00:32:48,163
No need to.
If you betray me, you'll just die.

419
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,433
A jutsu that ensnares
the enemy in green crystal?

420
00:32:57,514 --> 00:32:58,807
Earth Style?

421
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,062
I've never seen anything
like it before...

422
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:04,273
My parasitic insects have been
destroyed in the same way.

423
00:33:13,537 --> 00:33:15,223
This couldn't be...

424
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:25,545
Young lady,
the dango here is truly wonderful!

425
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,171
Of course, with a beautiful lady
like you serving it,

426
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,090
there is no way
it can't be delicious!

427
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,509
Oh dear, don't call me
beautiful like that.

428
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,302
The dango sure is good,

429
00:33:33,327 --> 00:33:36,080
but I'll bet you're much tastier,
ain't that right?

430
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:47,442
We're finally here!
Pervy Sage, let's start training!

431
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:48,651
What are you saying?

432
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,820
First, we wash off the dirt
from our travels.

433
00:33:52,225 --> 00:33:55,061
Healing your arm is also
part of training.

434
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,744
The hot spring here is
good for broken bones.

435
00:33:58,619 --> 00:33:59,704
Besides...

436
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,040
Hot springs... are so much fun.

437
00:34:03,696 --> 00:34:05,698
It's research... Research!

438
00:34:07,933 --> 00:34:10,018
You haven't changed, Pervy Sage.

439
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,497
Weren't you nearly killed
by Grandma Tsunade

440
00:34:12,522 --> 00:34:14,107
for peeking into the women's bath?

441
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,971
No!

442
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:20,391
The last time I came,
I'm sure it was a mixed bath.

443
00:34:20,727 --> 00:34:22,186
Funny...

444
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:25,480
Maybe they separated the bath
because of guys like you?

445
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:29,984
Huh? Just what have you
been learning from your teacher?

446
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:33,071
Why do you think I do these things?

447
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:34,572
'Cuz you're a pervert.

448
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:35,865
You idiot!

449
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:39,327
The research for
the Make-Out series is a cover.

450
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:41,245
This is actually ninja training

451
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:44,415
to make oneself go unnoticed
by women who are on guard.

452
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,250
Yeah yeah.

453
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,253
Ahem... Anyway, being here
at these hot springs

454
00:34:49,278 --> 00:34:51,697
is really to treat your broken bone.

455
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,842
Think of soaking in the bath
as part of training.

456
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:59,222
Pervy Sage, hurry and train me...!

457
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:02,809
Seriously... You're such an annoying kid!

458
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:04,640
Huh?

459
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:14,779
No need to worry about this now.

460
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:22,078
I've trained so that instead of...
relying on Nine-Tails' power...

461
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:24,722
rather than use a power
that hurts everyone...

462
00:35:24,847 --> 00:35:30,044
I've trained to attain the power
to protect, but it's just not enough!

463
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:35,550
Pervy Sage, isn't there a
long-distance type jutsu that I can learn?

464
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,932
Talking as though
he's a full-fledged ninja...

465
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:50,106
Pervy Sage, do you think I've gotten
a bit stronger at least?

466
00:35:51,054 --> 00:35:52,512
What are you saying?

467
00:35:52,537 --> 00:35:55,332
You're the same novice
you were three years ago.

468
00:35:55,357 --> 00:35:58,986
I see... I guess so...

469
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:08,787
<i>If that's what being wise means,</i>

470
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,032
<i>then I don't care if I'm a fool
for the rest of my life.</i>

471
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:14,507
<i>Even without a teacher,</i>

472
00:36:14,532 --> 00:36:18,373
<i>I'll create some awesome jutsu
and rescue Sasuke, no matter what!</i>

473
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:23,431
Tell me... Have your feelings changed
since three years ago?

474
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:28,019
I never take back my word.
That's my ninja way!

475
00:36:28,274 --> 00:36:30,652
Hmm, I guess so.

476
00:36:32,324 --> 00:36:33,997
<i>I was concerned about my friend,</i>

477
00:36:34,022 --> 00:36:37,317
<i>and what I gained from it was
a sense of helplessness and regret.</i>

478
00:36:37,943 --> 00:36:39,697
<i>Yet Naruto has lived</i>

479
00:36:39,994 --> 00:36:42,413
<i>with the same regret for three years
without giving up</i>

480
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,354
<i>on his friend...</i>

481
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:48,080
<i>He has never forgotten Sasuke
and has continued to train...</i>

482
00:36:48,374 --> 00:36:51,586
<i>Earnest in his desire to bring
Sasuke back home to Hidden Leaf Village.</i>

483
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:54,240
<i>Even if his own body is battered...</i>

484
00:36:57,256 --> 00:37:00,676
The idiot has matured in his idiot way.
I'll acknowledge that.

485
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,221
Just a little bit.

486
00:37:03,246 --> 00:37:04,372
Really?

487
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:08,309
But in order to bring him back,
I've have to get much stronger.

488
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,687
<i>Maybe he can...</i>

489
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,388
They say, "a place where
someone still thinks of you;

490
00:37:15,413 --> 00:37:17,666
that's a place you can call home."

491
00:37:21,705 --> 00:37:22,256
Yeah.

492
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:30,549
What is it, Kakashi?

493
00:37:31,566 --> 00:37:32,706
Take this to the village.

494
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:36,229
Have the Fifth Hokage analyze it.

495
00:37:38,585 --> 00:37:39,753
What is this...?

496
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,526
One of Shino's parasitic insects
which fell victim to a jutsu...

497
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:45,012
It was an enemy believed to be
a follower of Orochimaru.

498
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,223
Orochimaru?!

499
00:37:47,764 --> 00:37:48,975
According to the footprints,

500
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:53,729
there are five or six more
that we must pursue.

501
00:37:54,557 --> 00:37:55,675
Move quickly.

502
00:37:57,115 --> 00:37:58,282
Leave it to me!

503
00:37:59,727 --> 00:38:00,611
I'm counting on you.

504
00:38:03,329 --> 00:38:05,662
All right, we're going to
pursue the enemy.

505
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:10,253
Increase the range...
spread out and search.

506
00:38:11,224 --> 00:38:12,969
Don't miss a single trace of them!

507
00:38:13,339 --> 00:38:13,858
Right!

508
00:38:14,507 --> 00:38:15,030
Yeah.

509
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:26,470
Don't worry. I, Rinji, will handle
things while you're away.

510
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,787
I'm counting on you.

511
00:38:29,994 --> 00:38:33,352
I guess she still
can't trust us.

512
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,564
She doesn't want us to learn
about Orochimaru's hideout,

513
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:39,108
so we're shoved into
a place like this...

514
00:38:39,642 --> 00:38:42,611
She's extremely cautious.

515
00:38:43,035 --> 00:38:45,990
It's why she rarely
makes mistakes.

516
00:38:47,185 --> 00:38:49,410
So conversely, we can trust her.

517
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:51,763
The ones who were killed
were trying to run away

518
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:54,604
because they didn't want
to see Orochimaru.

519
00:38:55,457 --> 00:38:57,235
Can you really trust her?

520
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,368
Those are cattails.

521
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:31,410
Huh?

522
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,662
Grab the tips.

523
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,654
This is the lake.

524
00:40:19,547 --> 00:40:23,009
It's true, lake water
isn't salty at all.

525
00:40:23,404 --> 00:40:24,721
It's different from the ocean.

526
00:40:25,432 --> 00:40:29,263
Although... I've never seen
the ocean either.

527
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,070
Just now...

528
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:49,157
Hmm?

529
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:07,114
Well, around here should do...

530
00:41:12,733 --> 00:41:13,995
What's so funny?

531
00:41:17,106 --> 00:41:19,718
I have a feeling something fun
is about to start.

532
00:41:20,085 --> 00:41:22,938
Yeah, we're going to
have some fun.

533
00:41:23,691 --> 00:41:25,359
Can you put this on?

534
00:41:40,061 --> 00:41:43,239
This is a special medicine,
which will draw out your power...

535
00:41:43,472 --> 00:41:46,225
no, make something
interesting happen.

536
00:42:23,321 --> 00:42:24,209
<i>It's coming...</i>

537
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,908
<i>That's the limit.</i>

538
00:42:48,603 --> 00:42:51,933
<i>It's there... no doubt about it.
In this lake...</i>

539
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,154
<i>And... this child...</i>

540
00:42:54,768 --> 00:42:56,336
<i>we can use him.</i>

541
00:42:58,577 --> 00:42:59,731
<i>Lord Orochimaru...</i>

542
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:03,539
Well now, shall we begin training?

543
00:43:03,697 --> 00:43:05,740
Yeah! I'm ready!

544
00:43:05,765 --> 00:43:10,854
Maybe we'll do a simple jutsu using
your Wind chakra this time.

545
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:12,506
A simple jutsu?!

546
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:18,178
Do you remember the training
we did during our last journey?

547
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:22,308
I remember doing all kinds of things...

548
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,227
Remember,
you trained with the toad?

549
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:42,032
Th-That's the one character
I couldn't handle.

550
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:43,980
You remember?

551
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:46,242
I figured it was a bit
too early back then,

552
00:43:46,267 --> 00:43:47,602
but you can do it now.

553
00:43:49,097 --> 00:43:51,474
It's a collaboration ninjutsu with a toad!

554
00:43:51,896 --> 00:43:56,317
Combining two jutsu to transform them
into one stronger jutsu

555
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:57,676
is known as a collaboration jutsu.

556
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,220
Hey, I know that!

557
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:03,365
When we beat that Akatsuki fellow,

558
00:44:03,467 --> 00:44:06,890
Captain Yamato combined
his Water Style with my Wind Style

559
00:44:07,203 --> 00:44:09,955
to form the Hurricane Vortex Jutsu.

560
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,274
Good, that makes it easier.

561
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,986
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

562
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,658
Oh Jira-chan... it's been so long.

563
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,703
Gamariki, sorry to make you
come so far.

564
00:44:25,007 --> 00:44:29,595
Oh, don't mention it.
You and I are old friends.

565
00:44:31,165 --> 00:44:33,020
Why... Why is Gamariki here...?!

566
00:44:33,162 --> 00:44:35,640
Oh, Naruto. You're here too?

567
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:42,359
Unless the ninja duo is completely
in sync,

568
00:44:42,529 --> 00:44:44,281
a combination ninjutsu is impossible.

569
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:48,477
Yamato must have had perfect timing
with his Hurricane Vortex jutsu.

570
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:50,187
Oh, then it's useless.

571
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:54,274
Not him... there's no way
he can synchronize with me.

572
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:58,070
Shut up! Shut up!
If we can't, then it's your fault!

573
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:01,907
Besides, why do I have to sync up
with Gamariki?!

574
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:05,202
To perfect a new jutsu, right?

575
00:45:06,242 --> 00:45:07,596
From this moment on,

576
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:14,586
you will train to synch your timing
with Gamariki's timing.

577
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:20,175
Well, I guess if you insist,
Jiraiya, I have no choice...

578
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:25,422
B-But! Don't you think it'll be
an even greater Combination ninjutsu

579
00:45:25,447 --> 00:45:26,907
if you and I did it, Pervy Sage?

580
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:29,309
I can't be with you all the time.

581
00:45:29,398 --> 00:45:32,485
But you can summon the toad.

582
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:38,444
But, you know...
is this jutsu really strong?

583
00:45:41,308 --> 00:45:42,447
Gamariki...

584
00:45:44,334 --> 00:45:45,711
Watch carefully.

585
00:45:45,736 --> 00:45:47,029
Be gentle, okay?

586
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:57,713
Wow... I didn't know you were
so strong, Gamariki.

587
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:04,386
With perfect timing, my chakra flowed
into Gamariki's Water Pistol.

588
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:10,350
Your Wind chakra will go well
with the Water.

589
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:13,353
If you practice, you'll be able to perfect
an even stronger jutsu.

590
00:46:13,874 --> 00:46:15,439
An even stronger jutsu...

591
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:19,943
All right! I'll do it! Just bring it on!

592
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:21,945
First comes special rhythm training.

593
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:23,930
S-Special rhythm training?

594
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:26,658
- One, two, one, two...
- One, two, one, two...

595
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:29,203
- One, two, one, two...
- One, two, one, two...

596
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:32,706
- One, two, one, two...
- One, two, one, two...

597
00:46:33,686 --> 00:46:35,980
- One, two, one-!
- One, two, one-!

598
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,296
Gamariki and I...

599
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:40,631
Naruto and I...

600
00:46:41,019 --> 00:46:43,141
- aren't compatible!
- Aren't compatible!

601
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:46,261
Maybe it's not possible.

602
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:48,639
One, two... One, two...

603
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,808
One, two... One, two...

604
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:54,995
You're working hard, Naruto.

605
00:46:55,020 --> 00:47:00,901
Gamariki's sternness will temper you
like steel and nurture you...

606
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:02,861
– Awesome!
– An outdoor bath!

607
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:06,240
And before long, your body
will be tough enough...

608
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:08,992
to repel any temptation
of the world--!

609
00:47:10,913 --> 00:47:14,041
Can't repel...
any temptation of the world...

610
00:47:14,685 --> 00:47:18,669
Goodness! Can you even do
something this simple?!

611
00:47:18,694 --> 00:47:23,032
What're you saying?!
It's the way you teach that's bad!

612
00:47:23,365 --> 00:47:27,361
Oh? You're blaming me?
You think you're better than me?

613
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:29,931
Humph! Forget it!
I can't take this anymore!

614
00:47:29,956 --> 00:47:32,167
Hey! Stop right there!
Love Smack!

615
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,688
Damn it!
Coming at me from behind...

616
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:39,439
That's cowardly!

617
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:43,318
– Take this! And that!
– Stop!

618
00:47:52,238 --> 00:47:53,877
What is this?!

619
00:47:53,902 --> 00:47:55,612
The water's all gone.

620
00:47:56,068 --> 00:47:57,236
Let's go.

621
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:01,712
No!

622
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:05,549
You call this training?!
Slobbering around like that--?!

623
00:48:05,853 --> 00:48:07,396
This is the Love Smack!

624
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:10,415
Forget your Love Smack!
This duo is disbanded!

625
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,067
Fine with me!

626
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:15,017
That's enough! Both of you!

627
00:48:17,437 --> 00:48:23,942
As if Naruto isn't enough...
But you too, Gamariki...

628
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:28,614
Well, you know Jira-chan,
it's not like I don't understand.

629
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:30,324
I do, but...

630
00:48:30,799 --> 00:48:33,427
For a collaboration ninjutsu using
the Wind Style and Water Style,

631
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:36,413
nothing is more important
than synchronizing with the toad.

632
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,290
All the more reason why...

633
00:48:38,433 --> 00:48:42,723
our bodies must be compatible,
or it's useless for me.

634
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:45,230
Yeah well, we aren't compatible,

635
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:49,092
so it'll be faster if
we find someone who is.

636
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:52,679
Hmm... That may be a good idea.

637
00:48:53,325 --> 00:48:57,935
However... you can't summon
with that arm, can you?

638
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:02,272
Hah! You haven't forgotten
how fast I recover, have you?

639
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:03,548
Pervy Sage!

640
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:14,813
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

641
00:49:18,111 --> 00:49:19,676
H-Huh?!

642
00:49:20,845 --> 00:49:22,638
Long time no see...

643
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:25,754
Hello, Naruto!

644
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:28,090
Huh?! Gamakichi and Tatsu...?

645
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:31,385
Oh, you've grown!

646
00:49:34,035 --> 00:49:37,057
You guys have gotten pretty big.

647
00:49:37,325 --> 00:49:38,785
Of course we have!

648
00:49:39,015 --> 00:49:41,851
It's because of all the snacks
we've eaten.

649
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:45,399
Anyway, why'd you summon us?

650
00:49:45,627 --> 00:49:49,277
Oh yeah, I have some
important business!

651
00:49:49,373 --> 00:49:51,208
I want to work on our compatibility.

652
00:49:52,001 --> 00:49:52,777
What?!

653
00:49:53,635 --> 00:49:55,553
Does that taste good?

654
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,107
<i>Lord Orochimaru!</i>

655
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:13,885
<i>That's...</i>

656
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:36,709
<i>You're late.</i>

657
00:50:37,554 --> 00:50:40,516
<i>Lord Orochimaru has
chosen Genyumaru.</i>

658
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,124
<i>And that was Sasuke Uchiha
just now...</i>

659
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:46,933
<i>Lord Orochimaru's next vessel...</i>

660
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:10,442
Sasuke, let me see the results
of your training thus far.

661
00:51:10,879 --> 00:51:12,965
You're my opponent?

662
00:51:13,955 --> 00:51:14,873
By no means.

663
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:23,096
How impressive.

664
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:27,626
A thousand enemies stand before you,
and you don't even flinch.

665
00:51:33,436 --> 00:51:36,815
<i>That man... How strong is he...?</i>

666
00:51:37,894 --> 00:51:38,817
Begin.

667
00:51:47,908 --> 00:51:51,579
Sasuke... You are truly...

668
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:14,965
<i>The power you have...
I'm interested.</i>

669
00:52:17,696 --> 00:52:19,349
<i>Come with me.</i>

670
00:52:25,867 --> 00:52:26,993
<i>Back then...</i>

671
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:30,188
<i>I was the one captivated
by your power...</i>

672
00:52:30,717 --> 00:52:32,240
<i>Your strength...</i>

673
00:52:32,544 --> 00:52:35,339
<i>To become like you... was my dream.</i>

674
00:52:38,709 --> 00:52:41,344
There's only one reason
why you were summoned...

675
00:52:42,217 --> 00:52:45,328
I need you to do something for me.

676
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:50,792
Of course. That is the reason
why I serve you, Lord Orochimaru.

677
00:52:51,536 --> 00:52:55,958
I really want you
for this mission.

678
00:52:57,183 --> 00:53:01,312
In fact... you're the only one
who can do it.

679
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:03,263
Only me?

680
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:07,851
Then perhaps,
I may want to reconsider.

681
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:15,650
Who... is most worthy of
becoming my vessel.

682
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:42,469
<i>He's quite fatigued...
Perhaps we should rest a bit.</i>

683
00:53:55,357 --> 00:54:00,320
Damn it! How am I supposed to
keep up with those ridiculous moves?!

684
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:03,823
I guess trying to connect
heart-to-heart is crazy...

685
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:04,991
especially with the toads.

686
00:54:05,243 --> 00:54:07,017
Can you... connect hearts?

687
00:54:07,598 --> 00:54:09,516
Wh-Who the hell are you?!

688
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:12,415
Where'd you come from...?

689
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,920
What does it mean to
connect heart-to-heart?

690
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,172
Huh?! W-Well...

691
00:54:19,197 --> 00:54:21,240
My feelings are understood
by someone else...

692
00:54:21,265 --> 00:54:23,475
and that person's feelings
reach me as well.

693
00:54:23,663 --> 00:54:25,415
Then it happens?

694
00:54:25,532 --> 00:54:27,492
Y-Yeah, well sure.

695
00:54:29,844 --> 00:54:32,347
I mean, if you really focus
on it hard...

696
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:36,324
Then one day... one day,
it will work.

697
00:54:36,777 --> 00:54:38,446
And even Sasuke...

698
00:54:38,759 --> 00:54:42,137
Then that person you're thinking
about will know where home is.

699
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:48,034
Oh... You wouldn't know
what I mean, would you...

700
00:54:48,344 --> 00:54:50,308
if I start rambling on like that?

701
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:54,107
So if someone is thinking about me,

702
00:54:54,436 --> 00:54:56,813
then that's the place I go back to?

703
00:54:57,502 --> 00:55:00,880
Yeah... that's home.

704
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:03,137
That's good to know.

705
00:55:03,294 --> 00:55:04,712
Yeah, right?

706
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:12,726
By the way, what's your name–

707
00:55:13,263 --> 00:55:14,555
Huh? Hey?

708
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:25,488
That kid... Where'd he disappear to?

709
00:55:33,133 --> 00:55:34,468
Do you smell something, Akamaru?

710
00:55:38,005 --> 00:55:39,632
Did you find anything, Kiba?

711
00:55:40,178 --> 00:55:43,348
No, we haven't picked up any scents.

712
00:55:43,941 --> 00:55:46,235
I used my Byakugan,
but couldn't see anything.

713
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:47,960
Oh!

714
00:55:51,404 --> 00:55:52,405
A bat?

715
00:55:53,667 --> 00:55:54,793
There are some signs.

716
00:55:55,205 --> 00:55:57,249
Huh? Where?!

717
00:55:57,953 --> 00:56:02,165
I'm talking about my insects.
So don't get so excited.

718
00:56:02,854 --> 00:56:05,481
Your insects?
Don't get me excited like that.

719
00:56:05,954 --> 00:56:08,831
Well, you had tens of thousands
of insects,

720
00:56:08,856 --> 00:56:11,817
so I wouldn't be surprised
if one of them is still alive.

721
00:56:12,095 --> 00:56:15,139
But that one insect
out of tens of thousands

722
00:56:15,353 --> 00:56:19,315
that managed to survive
becomes a huge asset to us.

723
00:56:19,932 --> 00:56:21,559
... Asset to us?

724
00:56:21,844 --> 00:56:26,266
Because it has survived despite
incurring the enemy's jutsu.

725
00:56:26,929 --> 00:56:30,558
You mean the insects are
now immune to the enemy's jutsu...

726
00:56:31,085 --> 00:56:35,548
My insects' life span is only
a few hours at most.

727
00:56:35,879 --> 00:56:39,966
And the immune insects can breed
in a very short period.

728
00:56:40,194 --> 00:56:41,862
That's amazing!

729
00:56:42,322 --> 00:56:45,868
But it's just a possibility.
I'm not sure if it'll be successful.

730
00:56:46,506 --> 00:56:49,676
Anyway, I must find as many
surviving insects as possible.

731
00:56:50,391 --> 00:56:51,892
We'll help you.

732
00:56:52,184 --> 00:56:54,186
Yeah! Count on us!

733
00:56:54,325 --> 00:56:55,201
There's no need.

734
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:56,777
What?!

735
00:56:56,802 --> 00:57:00,306
Only I can search for
the insects.

736
00:57:00,951 --> 00:57:06,290
I can't have you stepping on them
while you're searching around blindly.

737
00:57:06,977 --> 00:57:10,272
Can't you refuse our help
with a little more finesse?

738
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:14,139
I don't want to waste time
by being vague.

739
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,141
That's fine.

740
00:57:16,684 --> 00:57:18,895
Shino, you go find the insects
that survived.

741
00:57:19,471 --> 00:57:22,099
And we'll continue our search.

742
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,941
All right, let's go, Akamaru!

743
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:51,676
Sorry, but I've had a series
of snake eyes.

744
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:57,307
Hey man, I hope you're not cheating.

745
00:57:58,057 --> 00:57:59,058
No way!

746
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:03,897
I was born lucky,
and I'm totally different from you.

747
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,942
No wonder I'm losing.

748
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:11,404
Since your luck is so strong,

749
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:13,448
let me roll the dice
that you just used!

750
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:15,033
She's late.

751
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:20,330
Ahh! Almost!
Just one more roll!

752
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:29,458
Want to try?
It's a good way to kill time.

753
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:35,178
You're ignoring me?

754
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:36,804
Fine.

755
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,766
Fine. But I'm a little surprised...

756
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:44,771
That you're waiting for Guren
to come back.

757
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:49,526
You seemed defiant to me,

758
00:58:49,846 --> 00:58:52,172
so I thought you'd take advantage
of this chance to escape.

759
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:55,365
Even if I could escape,
I couldn't beat her.

760
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:58,451
That's a surprising answer.

761
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:02,580
I didn't know you had decided
to obey Guren.

762
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:06,006
How about you guys?

763
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:07,627
Us?

764
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:11,005
You knew from the beginning...

765
00:59:11,717 --> 00:59:15,178
that a fight for survival
would occur in that hideout.

766
00:59:17,662 --> 00:59:22,375
I thought you had already
joined forces with them.

767
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:29,607
You're sharp! That's right!

768
00:59:29,932 --> 00:59:31,851
But it's not surprising.

769
00:59:31,876 --> 00:59:35,213
It's better to have people who help
each other in dangerous situations.

770
00:59:35,372 --> 00:59:38,618
So we promised to help each other
when things got rough.

771
00:59:42,878 --> 00:59:46,173
Those who overestimated
their own abilities

772
00:59:46,371 --> 00:59:48,378
and acted thoughtlessly have died.

773
00:59:49,331 --> 00:59:52,960
So I say, our wisdom has
helped us to survive.

774
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:57,510
Though, at the rate we were going
in that battle royal,

775
00:59:57,677 --> 01:00:01,931
we might've fought each other.

776
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:13,318
It's true that you were really strong
out there all by yourself.

777
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:19,490
While we were fighting individually,
we had to keep away from you...

778
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:22,410
But we are four here.

779
01:00:23,034 --> 01:00:26,121
We won't be beaten
if we stay together, not even by you.

780
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:30,668
Now we all work for Guren...

781
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:34,380
You'd better socialize with the others.

782
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:41,259
Man, why couldn't they find
a better hideout?

783
01:00:42,102 --> 01:00:47,691
Guren isn't nice to us.
She left us in this old shack.

784
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:58,112
I'm going on patrol.

785
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:38,027
Did you find something?

786
01:01:46,893 --> 01:01:48,020
What's wrong, Akamaru?!

787
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,626
Deliver this information quickly.

788
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:12,979
I thought you were out
on patrol.

789
01:02:13,309 --> 01:02:17,563
I had something to think about.
I'm just setting out.

790
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:21,487
I'll go with you.

791
01:02:23,717 --> 01:02:27,971
Does that mean...
you're heeding my advice?

792
01:02:31,797 --> 01:02:32,798
A dog whistle?

793
01:02:32,870 --> 01:02:36,457
Right. Akamaru said
he definitely heard it.

794
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:39,556
Do you think the enemy
has a dog?

795
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,841
I doubt it,

796
01:02:41,966 --> 01:02:46,429
because it's harder to mask
a dog's scent than a human's.

797
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:48,723
And if they have a dog,

798
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:51,058
Akamaru and I would've
caught its scent long ago.

799
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:53,561
Then, why the dog whistle?

800
01:02:54,099 --> 01:02:55,183
I don't know.

801
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:57,145
Do you know which direction
it came from?

802
01:02:57,217 --> 01:03:01,221
No, but I'm sure they're not far away.

803
01:03:03,822 --> 01:03:05,115
A new enemy?

804
01:03:05,534 --> 01:03:08,120
Right. The enemy seems
really hard to beat.

805
01:03:08,383 --> 01:03:10,677
I saw that the team
was really flustered.

806
01:03:11,636 --> 01:03:13,304
Therefore, you're giving this to me?

807
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:16,584
There's something inside the crystal.

808
01:03:17,134 --> 01:03:20,304
It's Shino's Parasitic Insect that was
overcome by the enemy's jutsu.

809
01:03:20,743 --> 01:03:23,704
Kakashi requested an
analysis right away.

810
01:03:24,557 --> 01:03:25,934
<i>This can't be...</i>

811
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:29,469
<i>I've only heard about it
through rumors...</i>

812
01:03:30,463 --> 01:03:33,049
Shizune, take this to the forensics team.

813
01:03:33,493 --> 01:03:34,494
It's urgent!

814
01:03:34,724 --> 01:03:35,308
All right!

815
01:03:38,753 --> 01:03:42,381
<i>Frog... I'm a frog...</i>

816
01:03:44,391 --> 01:03:46,935
<i>Gamatatsu's... mind...</i>

817
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:50,827
I can hear... the frog song.

818
01:03:51,623 --> 01:03:55,627
<i>Read his mind...
and respond to it...</i>

819
01:03:56,712 --> 01:04:00,424
- I can hear...
- the frog song.

820
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:04,556
- Chinchiro chinchiro chinchirorin.
- I can hear...

821
01:04:04,873 --> 01:04:06,833
Chinchiro chinchiro...

822
01:04:06,858 --> 01:04:09,611
- ... chinchirorin.
- I can hear...

823
01:04:09,816 --> 01:04:13,110
- ... the frog song.
- I can hear... the frog song.

824
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:16,308
- Chinchiro chinchiro chinchirorin.
- I can hear... the frog song.

825
01:04:16,477 --> 01:04:19,730
Naruto, you don't look like you've
opened up your mind yet!

826
01:04:19,926 --> 01:04:22,470
Don't get swept up by
Gamatatsu's movements!

827
01:04:23,626 --> 01:04:26,087
Communicate with Gamatatsu's mind,

828
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:28,781
arrange things your way,
then just express yourself!

829
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:29,801
Yeah!

830
01:04:30,567 --> 01:04:30,980
Huh?

831
01:04:36,455 --> 01:04:37,195
Sorry...

832
01:04:38,767 --> 01:04:44,314
- Look Gamakichi is singing.
- Look Gamakichi is singing.

833
01:04:44,530 --> 01:04:47,449
- Gero gero gero gero gero...
- Gero gero gero gero gero...

834
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:53,393
- Look Gamatatsu is singing too.
- Look Gamatatsu is singing too.

835
01:04:53,943 --> 01:04:56,946
- Kero kero kero kero kero...
- Kero kero kero kero kero...

836
01:04:57,984 --> 01:05:01,321
<i>Gamatatsu's... mind...</i>

837
01:05:03,544 --> 01:05:08,507
Ah, that cloud...
looks like a cream puff...

838
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,660
It looks yummy!

839
01:05:12,573 --> 01:05:15,451
<i>They've finally reached
each other's mind...</i>

840
01:05:16,374 --> 01:05:20,336
Oh? Did you feel something
just now, Gamatatsu?

841
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:23,044
Why are you asking me this?

842
01:05:26,796 --> 01:05:28,547
A butterfly!

843
01:05:28,861 --> 01:05:29,703
What?!

844
01:05:30,274 --> 01:05:31,980
- Rock, paper, scissors, go!
- Rock, paper, scissors, go!

845
01:05:32,165 --> 01:05:33,958
- Rock, paper, scissors, go!
- Rock, paper, scissors, go!

846
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:35,313
- Go!
- Go!

847
01:05:35,737 --> 01:05:36,864
- Go!
- Go!

848
01:05:36,952 --> 01:05:37,828
- Go!
- Go!

849
01:05:37,853 --> 01:05:40,272
- Go! Go! Go!
- Go! Go! Go!

850
01:05:41,851 --> 01:05:44,479
- What's your name?
- Gamatatsu!

851
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:47,961
This doesn't mean
you're on the same wavelength.

852
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:55,048
- ? I can hear... the frog song.
- ? I can hear... the frog song.

853
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:58,409
-? Chinchiro chinchiro chinchirorin
-? Chinchiro chinchiro chinchirorin

854
01:06:08,069 --> 01:06:10,071
I can't move anymore...

855
01:06:19,137 --> 01:06:19,796
Here!

856
01:06:21,271 --> 01:06:22,731
Eat it!

857
01:06:25,135 --> 01:06:25,916
Thanks.

858
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:44,543
I think we all have to
acknowledge you.

859
01:06:45,547 --> 01:06:46,548
What?

860
01:06:47,299 --> 01:06:53,096
Gamatatsu, Gamakichi,
Sakura, Tsunade... and I...

861
01:06:53,795 --> 01:06:56,924
We all admit you've worked
really hard.

862
01:06:58,403 --> 01:07:00,572
I wonder what's pushing you forward.

863
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:05,716
Well, I never give up and I have guts!

864
01:07:09,574 --> 01:07:10,909
Sasuke...

865
01:07:11,371 --> 01:07:12,116
Hmm?

866
01:07:13,036 --> 01:07:15,581
I wonder if Sasuke will...

867
01:07:16,789 --> 01:07:19,709
acknowledge that about me...?

868
01:07:21,311 --> 01:07:23,522
I hope he does...

869
01:08:08,228 --> 01:08:09,229
What...?

870
01:08:14,850 --> 01:08:19,104
<i>I can't tell him about the Akatsuki...</i>

871
01:08:20,697 --> 01:08:22,240
Hey, all of you!

872
01:08:23,806 --> 01:08:27,017
I have something to do,
so I must leave.

873
01:08:27,657 --> 01:08:30,577
Can you go back to the village

874
01:08:30,951 --> 01:08:34,330
and help with the rest
of Naruto's training?

875
01:08:34,517 --> 01:08:36,519
We'll take care of it!

876
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:39,446
I'll do it if you give me
some snacks.

877
01:08:39,471 --> 01:08:42,140
All right, all right.
I'm counting on you!

878
01:08:47,294 --> 01:08:49,432
<i>Good luck, Naruto!</i>

879
01:08:50,153 --> 01:08:53,281
<i>Work hard and truly become...
the Hokage...</i>

880
01:08:58,843 --> 01:09:03,598
<i>Naruto, good luck with
your never-say-die spirit...</i>

881
01:09:08,512 --> 01:09:11,641
What?! The Pervy Sage disappeared?!

882
01:09:12,134 --> 01:09:15,804
Yeah, he asked me
to give this to you.

883
01:09:16,358 --> 01:09:17,359
Give it to me!

884
01:09:21,437 --> 01:09:24,440
We're going back to our village.
Pack up!

885
01:09:26,325 --> 01:09:27,534
You summoned me?

886
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:31,375
Yamato, I want you to go
and assist Team Kakashi.

887
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:33,043
Kakashi-senpai?

888
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:35,588
I heard it was just a scouting mission.

889
01:09:35,650 --> 01:09:36,984
Has something happened?

890
01:09:37,009 --> 01:09:40,888
The problem is that
they had a run-in with the enemy.

891
01:09:41,604 --> 01:09:43,647
This foe uses a jutsu
we've never seen before.

892
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:45,806
A jutsu we've never seen before?

893
01:09:46,173 --> 01:09:48,188
We don't understand everything
about it yet.

894
01:09:48,718 --> 01:09:53,208
I'm having the sample Kakashi sent
analyzed right away.

895
01:09:53,870 --> 01:09:55,165
Who shall I take?

896
01:09:55,816 --> 01:10:01,655
Sai who can search from the sky,
and Sakura in case anyone is injured.

897
01:10:02,072 --> 01:10:05,034
But Sakura has gone on
an errand for me.

898
01:10:05,550 --> 01:10:07,511
She's to return at dawn.

899
01:10:07,795 --> 01:10:09,923
Set out as soon as
Sakura comes back.

900
01:10:10,367 --> 01:10:11,493
Understood.

901
01:10:11,682 --> 01:10:15,644
But if this involves Orochimaru,
won't Naruto want to go too?

902
01:10:15,791 --> 01:10:19,279
Now listen! Naruto is not
to find out about this.

903
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:22,927
And...?

904
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:26,972
Yes, there should be no problem
with Yuukimaru's strength.

905
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:29,808
All that remains is
to modify the drug.

906
01:10:30,189 --> 01:10:32,191
When will that be completed?

907
01:10:32,638 --> 01:10:34,473
It won't take very long.

908
01:10:34,789 --> 01:10:39,377
Then order Guren and Yuukimaru
to set out ahead.

909
01:10:39,594 --> 01:10:43,515
I know I've asked before,
but are you sure about that woman?

910
01:10:45,103 --> 01:10:47,021
We have no choice.

911
01:10:47,046 --> 01:10:50,341
This is something
only Guren can do.

912
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:55,903
This strategy will bear fruit

913
01:10:56,299 --> 01:11:00,047
once Guren and Yuukimaru's powers
become one.

914
01:11:16,552 --> 01:11:18,512
How long are you going
to make me wait?

915
01:11:20,114 --> 01:11:21,824
No more waiting.

916
01:11:21,849 --> 01:11:23,935
Lord Orochimaru has given his order.

917
01:11:24,422 --> 01:11:25,423
Really?!

918
01:11:26,441 --> 01:11:28,193
<i>So naïve.</i>

919
01:11:37,754 --> 01:11:38,755
Yuukimaru!

920
01:11:43,428 --> 01:11:47,015
Are we returning somewhere?
Will that be my home?

921
01:11:47,379 --> 01:11:48,880
Who is this kid?

922
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:52,167
You're taking him.
This boy.

923
01:11:53,012 --> 01:11:55,389
You expect me to babysit?

924
01:11:57,207 --> 01:11:58,917
Already complaining?

925
01:11:59,358 --> 01:12:02,152
Were you lying about being loyal
to Lord Orochimaru?

926
01:12:02,192 --> 01:12:06,530
Although, with that attitude,
no child will take to you.

927
01:12:19,727 --> 01:12:23,416
Don't act smug just because
you're Lord Orochimaru's aide.

928
01:12:23,631 --> 01:12:26,092
I can kill you anytime.

929
01:12:26,682 --> 01:12:31,103
<i>I see. She's able to instantly
crystallize anything that's nearby.</i>

930
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:35,642
<i>Although she looks unarmed,
everything around her is a weapon.</i>

931
01:12:35,932 --> 01:12:37,266
<i>So that is the Crystal Style.</i>

932
01:12:37,903 --> 01:12:40,572
<i>No wonder she caught
Lord Orochimaru's eye.</i>

933
01:12:41,973 --> 01:12:46,477
If I die, your reincarnation
will be in jeopardy.

934
01:12:47,821 --> 01:12:50,574
You want to become one
with Lord Orochimaru, don't you?

935
01:12:56,611 --> 01:12:57,862
So pretty!

936
01:12:58,832 --> 01:13:01,085
What are you saying?

937
01:13:02,202 --> 01:13:03,954
Isn't it going to rain more?

938
01:13:04,362 --> 01:13:07,198
Humph, what a weird kid.

939
01:13:08,237 --> 01:13:09,863
You make a nice pair.

940
01:13:10,181 --> 01:13:10,926
Whoa.

941
01:13:11,303 --> 01:13:15,342
I'll catch up right away.
So go on ahead with Yuukimaru.

942
01:13:16,383 --> 01:13:17,593
All right.

943
01:13:17,618 --> 01:13:20,954
But if he gives me any lip,
I'll let him have it.

944
01:13:21,222 --> 01:13:24,893
Be careful. Someone's approaching
from over that way.

945
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:28,153
What?! How would you know that?

946
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:30,072
I didn't tell you, did I?

947
01:13:30,462 --> 01:13:33,715
On the way to your hideout,
I took care of an ANBU Black Ops

948
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:36,326
from the Hidden Leaf Village
who was checking out the area

949
01:13:36,721 --> 01:13:38,472
The Leaf Village is sure
to be on the move.

950
01:13:39,134 --> 01:13:40,943
You don't want to get involved
with them.

951
01:13:40,968 --> 01:13:42,303
Make sure you give them the slip.

952
01:13:42,515 --> 01:13:44,351
I'll be the judge of that.

953
01:13:44,777 --> 01:13:47,363
Remember, if you fail
in this mission with Yuukimaru,

954
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:50,884
all discussion of
your reincarnation ends.

955
01:13:56,181 --> 01:13:57,724
The Hidden Leaf...

956
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:04,565
<i>Those guys! They'd better not betray me
and run to the Hidden Leaf!</i>

957
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:08,110
Am I going home?

958
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:11,864
I hope I can return home...

959
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:17,494
But is there a place I can return to?

960
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:22,291
<i>A place where someone thinks of you,
that's where home is.</i>

961
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:25,534
I'm sure there is.

962
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:45,022
Look over here.
These are dog tracks.

963
01:14:46,873 --> 01:14:48,375
A dog...

964
01:14:48,819 --> 01:14:50,154
<i>That was a bad move.</i>

965
01:15:05,792 --> 01:15:08,545
They've become so weak,
I can't feel their response.

966
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:36,281
Found one!

967
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:55,175
All right! It's got eggs.

968
01:15:56,243 --> 01:15:57,328
If I can make them hatch...

969
01:16:29,501 --> 01:16:31,461
Is it true the enemy
is prowling around?

970
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:34,965
I'm sure of it.
They're hiding in this mountain.

971
01:16:35,173 --> 01:16:36,550
Just who are they?

972
01:16:36,967 --> 01:16:37,801
I don't know.

973
01:16:37,801 --> 01:16:41,013
But if they're searching for
Orochimaru's hideout...

974
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:43,682
Either the Akatsuki...
or the Hidden Leaf.

975
01:16:43,974 --> 01:16:46,268
What'll we do? Should we attack?

976
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:51,231
Without Guren, there's no guarantee
that we can pull it off.

977
01:16:51,481 --> 01:16:52,774
I was wrong...

978
01:16:52,774 --> 01:16:54,443
About what?

979
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:59,906
I figured this was your chance...
to make a run for it.

980
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:01,408
A run for it?

981
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:04,286
Your chance to run over
to the Hidden Leaf's side

982
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:06,496
with information
about Orochimaru as a gift.

983
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:12,919
I see. Well, I never gave it
a thought...

984
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:16,673
I get it. You want to turn yourself in
to the Hidden Leaf?

985
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:19,259
Not at all.

986
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:23,013
Then what's your reason
for sticking with Guren?

987
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,433
It's personal.

988
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:27,726
Hmm...?

989
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:36,943
Damn...

990
01:17:36,943 --> 01:17:41,073
If I were alone,
I'd already be there by now.

991
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:48,705
I don't want to go there anymore.

992
01:17:49,414 --> 01:17:54,670
I get headaches...
No, I want to go back.

993
01:17:55,962 --> 01:17:59,132
But I don't have a place to return to.

994
01:17:59,466 --> 01:18:02,094
Oh... But that person said...

995
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:09,100
If someone is thinking about me...
that's the place to go home to.

996
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:17,567
But how do I go about getting
someone to think about me?

997
01:18:17,934 --> 01:18:21,562
Can't you quit babbling
and start walking faster?

998
01:18:22,614 --> 01:18:25,117
<i>Seriously! Just what's with this kid?</i>

999
01:18:45,804 --> 01:18:49,015
A red camellia or a white one.
Which do you prefer?

1000
01:18:52,431 --> 01:18:53,432
A camellia...

1001
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:55,230
Camellia?

1002
01:18:57,274 --> 01:18:58,358
That...

1003
01:19:02,362 --> 01:19:04,823
Oh. Yes, this is a camellia, all right.

1004
01:19:06,199 --> 01:19:07,701
Do you like camellias?

1005
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:08,827
Camellias...

1006
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:12,914
I don't like camellias.

1007
01:19:14,207 --> 01:19:15,250
This is just coincidence.

1008
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:23,300
Hey!

1009
01:19:23,884 --> 01:19:25,010
What's the matter?!

1010
01:19:39,357 --> 01:19:40,442
Damn!

1011
01:19:48,825 --> 01:19:52,954
<i>Damn! There's no way we can go back
to the hideout in this rain.</i>

1012
01:19:58,768 --> 01:20:00,603
I-It's cold.

1013
01:20:00,628 --> 01:20:02,797
What? You're cold?

1014
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:08,567
A fever...!

1015
01:20:34,657 --> 01:20:36,701
How did it go? Find anything?

1016
01:20:37,113 --> 01:20:38,864
No, nothing...

1017
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,794
I found nothing either.

1018
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:42,796
Especially when it rains,

1019
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:45,549
these conditions make it impossible
to catch any scents.

1020
01:20:46,258 --> 01:20:48,093
So... no progress at all.

1021
01:20:49,719 --> 01:20:50,720
Huh?!

1022
01:20:51,745 --> 01:20:53,997
Even the bats are inside...

1023
01:20:54,198 --> 01:20:56,492
Huh? Bats?!

1024
01:20:56,738 --> 01:20:59,198
I'll go out and search once more.

1025
01:20:59,223 --> 01:21:01,145
No wait! Don't move.

1026
01:21:01,898 --> 01:21:03,400
What's the matter, Kiba?

1027
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:06,236
Well, I've been thinking about it
this whole time...

1028
01:21:06,343 --> 01:21:07,928
About that mysterious
dog whistle.

1029
01:21:08,321 --> 01:21:09,906
The mysterious dog whistle?

1030
01:21:09,906 --> 01:21:12,607
Yeah... There's an animal that uses
ultrasonic waves

1031
01:21:12,632 --> 01:21:14,842
with the same frequency
as a dog whistle...

1032
01:21:14,911 --> 01:21:15,912
These guys here.

1033
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:19,040
I see.

1034
01:21:20,792 --> 01:21:23,712
You're saying the enemy
is manipulating a bat?

1035
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:25,380
But which bat?

1036
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:28,550
Well, I don't know that.

1037
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:30,176
The more we move in the shadows,

1038
01:21:30,176 --> 01:21:32,846
the greater the chance
of our being detected.

1039
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:35,807
In fact, they may already
have spotted us.

1040
01:21:36,224 --> 01:21:40,103
Once the crystal sample
we sent to the village is analyzed,

1041
01:21:40,103 --> 01:21:42,314
we'll know what steps
can be taken next.

1042
01:21:42,814 --> 01:21:46,151
Right now, we have to place
our hopes on Shino's insects.

1043
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:08,340
<i>I have to deliver good news
to Lord Orochimaru...!</i>

1044
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:11,676
<i>I can't have you die right now!</i>

1045
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:13,553
<i>You got that? Don't die!</i>

1046
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:24,940
She's late!
When's she coming back?

1047
01:22:25,273 --> 01:22:28,610
Yeah, she should have returned by now.

1048
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:37,744
<i>I should've brought Rinji and Gozu.</i>

1049
01:22:38,453 --> 01:22:42,123
<i>Be careful. Someone's approaching
from over that way.</i>

1050
01:22:42,874 --> 01:22:46,127
<i>I can't waste time
in a place like this...</i>

1051
01:22:59,224 --> 01:23:00,306
Are you all right?

1052
01:23:02,801 --> 01:23:04,135
So warm.

1053
01:24:04,542 --> 01:24:06,955
This is the Parasitic Insect
we got from Shino, isn't it?

1054
01:24:07,081 --> 01:24:07,766
Yes.

1055
01:24:11,212 --> 01:24:12,505
What's this?!

1056
01:24:19,452 --> 01:24:21,955
What is this hexagonal pattern?!

1057
01:24:23,698 --> 01:24:26,659
Well, according the report from
the research team...

1058
01:24:27,243 --> 01:24:31,372
It means that even the body fluids of
Shino's parasitic insect have crystallized.

1059
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:35,681
I see...

1060
01:24:36,613 --> 01:24:38,573
What's the matter, Lady Tsunade?

1061
01:24:39,449 --> 01:24:41,910
I never thought it truly existed...

1062
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:44,120
Do you know something about this?

1063
01:24:44,788 --> 01:24:45,914
Yes.

1064
01:24:47,624 --> 01:24:50,502
In the past, a rumor had spread

1065
01:24:50,527 --> 01:24:53,405
about the existence of a ninjutsu
that crystallizes all materials.

1066
01:24:54,252 --> 01:24:57,214
It was said to even crystallize
human blood.

1067
01:24:58,665 --> 01:25:01,167
It's a ninjutsu technique
called Crystal Style.

1068
01:25:01,304 --> 01:25:05,433
It was said that an entire village
disappeared in one night because of it...

1069
01:25:05,718 --> 01:25:07,511
After it happened,

1070
01:25:07,732 --> 01:25:10,105
there were no reports by witnesses,
so it was dismissed as rumor.

1071
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:13,775
Then, you're saying that
Crystal Style actually existed?

1072
01:25:14,079 --> 01:25:17,832
Yes. If we relate the fact that
there were no witnesses for a long time

1073
01:25:18,096 --> 01:25:21,398
and the contact that Kakashi
and the others had,

1074
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:25,036
this could possibly be
one of Orochimaru's group.

1075
01:25:25,703 --> 01:25:28,248
Does that mean that Orochimaru
has begun moving?

1076
01:25:29,624 --> 01:25:32,210
It's already been three years
since Sasuke left the village.

1077
01:25:32,710 --> 01:25:36,881
It's about time for Orochimaru's
next reincarnation.

1078
01:25:37,882 --> 01:25:41,219
We should consider that Orochimaru
has begun making preparations for it.

1079
01:25:41,845 --> 01:25:44,889
We must use that Crystal Style ninja
as a lead to...

1080
01:25:45,718 --> 01:25:47,636
to learn Sasuke's whereabouts!

1081
01:25:58,903 --> 01:26:00,071
Damn!

1082
01:26:51,414 --> 01:26:52,630
What are you doing?

1083
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:54,334
Guren...

1084
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:58,171
Are you feeling better?

1085
01:27:00,806 --> 01:27:03,487
I can't have you disappearing
like that.

1086
01:27:04,151 --> 01:27:07,471
Lord Orochimaru entrusted you to me.

1087
01:27:12,602 --> 01:27:13,488
What's that?

1088
01:27:18,609 --> 01:27:19,458
My mom...

1089
01:27:21,694 --> 01:27:24,489
By the way, where's... your family?

1090
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:27,700
My mother... didn't return...

1091
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:32,455
So... I don't have anywhere to go.

1092
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:52,934
Camellias... You like them, right?

1093
01:27:53,768 --> 01:27:56,187
This camellia will never wither.

1094
01:27:57,939 --> 01:27:59,899
As long as I'm alive.

1095
01:28:03,475 --> 01:28:04,390
Let's go.

1096
01:28:17,047 --> 01:28:19,549
Milk is the best after training!

1097
01:28:20,049 --> 01:28:20,591
Oh?

1098
01:28:21,067 --> 01:28:22,235
Thank you, come again.

1099
01:28:24,377 --> 01:28:24,961
Sai!

1100
01:28:25,376 --> 01:28:26,058
Naruto...

1101
01:28:26,083 --> 01:28:28,460
What are you doing here?

1102
01:28:28,702 --> 01:28:31,038
I just ran out of ninja tool ink...

1103
01:28:31,669 --> 01:28:35,006
This store's ink works really well
for molding my chakra.

1104
01:28:35,401 --> 01:28:36,819
I see... Oh?

1105
01:28:37,567 --> 01:28:39,486
But if you need a refill of ink,
that means...

1106
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:41,600
Did you get a new mission?

1107
01:28:44,202 --> 01:28:46,704
<i>Today's mission is supposed
to be a secret.</i>

1108
01:28:47,733 --> 01:28:50,486
<i>I think that when a person tells a lie,
they avert their eyes...</i>

1109
01:28:51,234 --> 01:28:52,360
<i>Then I'll do the opposite...</i>

1110
01:28:54,203 --> 01:28:54,620
What?

1111
01:28:54,924 --> 01:28:57,385
I didn't get a new mission.

1112
01:28:58,082 --> 01:29:00,877
So continue your training
without worrying.

1113
01:29:01,002 --> 01:29:02,128
O-Oh...

1114
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:04,464
But why are you telling me
that all of a sudden?!

1115
01:29:05,548 --> 01:29:07,884
By any chance...
Are you hiding something from me?

1116
01:29:08,885 --> 01:29:10,053
Well... Not really...

1117
01:29:10,219 --> 01:29:13,389
Really?! Are you sure?

1118
01:29:13,389 --> 01:29:14,515
N-Nothing like that...

1119
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:18,227
"Practical use of a lie"?

1120
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:24,734
What's going on here?!

1121
01:29:25,109 --> 01:29:27,236
I heard about the mission, Grandma!

1122
01:29:27,573 --> 01:29:28,238
Really?

1123
01:29:28,363 --> 01:29:31,616
Please! Let me join this mission!

1124
01:29:31,657 --> 01:29:35,453
Naruto, we didn't tell you
because we were worried about you.

1125
01:29:35,495 --> 01:29:36,162
But...!

1126
01:29:36,382 --> 01:29:38,527
I understand how you feel, but even if
you manage to find Sasuke,

1127
01:29:38,552 --> 01:29:40,387
you're not skilled enough
to bring him back.

1128
01:29:41,088 --> 01:29:44,258
Besides, if you use that new jutsu...

1129
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:47,882
I won't use that jutsu...
Wind Style: Rasen shuriken.

1130
01:29:48,257 --> 01:29:50,468
I know more about
my body than anyone.

1131
01:29:50,551 --> 01:29:52,053
- Then...
- Naruto!

1132
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:56,307
Can you tell me
why you applied for this mission?

1133
01:29:56,724 --> 01:29:57,725
Because...

1134
01:29:59,519 --> 01:30:03,439
I know I'm not strong enough
to bring back Sasuke...

1135
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:06,943
But when Pervy Sage said something,
I thought...

1136
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:10,348
<i>The place where someone
still thinks of you,</i>

1137
01:30:10,373 --> 01:30:13,042
<i>that's called home...</i>

1138
01:30:14,276 --> 01:30:16,236
I believe that
if you think about someone,

1139
01:30:16,261 --> 01:30:17,596
your feelings will reach them...

1140
01:30:18,667 --> 01:30:20,635
I want to tell him...

1141
01:30:20,997 --> 01:30:25,042
that this is the place...
where he can return.

1142
01:30:35,805 --> 01:30:36,931
Do whatever you want.

1143
01:30:37,473 --> 01:30:39,350
Yes! That's the spirit!

1144
01:30:39,559 --> 01:30:41,144
An outline of the mission is...

1145
01:30:44,355 --> 01:30:46,190
Is this all right with you,
Lady Tsunade?

1146
01:30:46,524 --> 01:30:50,153
That Jiraiya...
he knew this would happen.

1147
01:30:54,323 --> 01:30:56,159
<i>Sorry, Tsunade!</i>

1148
01:30:56,576 --> 01:30:59,787
<i>Naruto is still in training,
but I received some urgent information.</i>

1149
01:31:00,371 --> 01:31:02,665
<i>I'll keep track
of the information.</i>

1150
01:31:03,166 --> 01:31:04,750
<i>I'm counting on you.</i>

1151
01:31:05,209 --> 01:31:09,422
<i>But... Naruto is still an idiot.</i>

1152
01:31:09,964 --> 01:31:12,758
<i>But he has a power
to change people.</i>

1153
01:31:13,132 --> 01:31:18,387
<i>Someday, he'll change
into something bigger.</i>

1154
01:31:20,685 --> 01:31:25,648
<i>Tsunade, a person grows up
when he's able to overcome hardships.</i>

1155
01:31:25,938 --> 01:31:28,107
<i>Protection is important,</i>

1156
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:30,651
<i>but there are some things
that a person must learn on his own.</i>

1157
01:31:31,736 --> 01:31:33,988
<i>Don't worry,
he got his guts from me...</i>

1158
01:31:34,057 --> 01:31:38,353
<i>So I hope you'll trust him
when the time comes...</i>

1159
01:31:42,498 --> 01:31:43,708
Lord Jiraiya...

1160
01:31:43,974 --> 01:31:46,959
In this mission... Yamato and
Kakashi are also team members.

1161
01:31:50,461 --> 01:31:54,298
And... he's not just a kid anymore...

1162
01:31:54,907 --> 01:31:58,244
I really need to use
that jutsu for this mission!

1163
01:32:08,328 --> 01:32:10,372
A place to return to...

1164
01:32:23,984 --> 01:32:24,985
What's that?

1165
01:32:26,013 --> 01:32:27,639
If they hadn't betrayed me,

1166
01:32:27,710 --> 01:32:30,546
there would be someone
holding down the fort.

1167
01:32:30,628 --> 01:32:31,629
Oh...

1168
01:32:36,175 --> 01:32:41,013
Hey... Where are you returning to?
Is there anybody waiting for you?

1169
01:32:41,931 --> 01:32:43,724
Hey, let's go, Yuukimaru!

1170
01:32:46,727 --> 01:32:47,728
Oh...

1171
01:32:49,939 --> 01:32:53,025
Hey... If there was a place where
someone was thinking about you,

1172
01:32:53,025 --> 01:32:54,485
that would be home, right?

1173
01:32:54,610 --> 01:32:55,611
Huh?

1174
01:33:12,275 --> 01:33:14,652
Now, Naruto has found out...

1175
01:33:14,967 --> 01:33:15,968
I'm sorry...

1176
01:33:16,299 --> 01:33:20,303
That's all right.
I didn't think we'd be able to hide it.

1177
01:33:20,803 --> 01:33:23,514
I was surprised he went to negotiate
with the Hokage himself...

1178
01:33:23,598 --> 01:33:26,726
But Lady Tsunade is not
a person who gives in to pressure.

1179
01:33:27,354 --> 01:33:29,689
She made a final decision to
allow him to join the mission.

1180
01:33:29,787 --> 01:33:31,456
So don't worry.

1181
01:33:31,584 --> 01:33:36,380
Right. And with everyone on board,
it'll be easier to communicate.

1182
01:33:36,902 --> 01:33:40,573
Still... Naruto is late.

1183
01:33:40,740 --> 01:33:42,116
I wonder what he's doing?

1184
01:33:48,247 --> 01:33:51,500
All right! I kind of feel like
I can do it!

1185
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:53,502
That's the spirit, Naruto.

1186
01:33:53,502 --> 01:33:56,589
All right! Gamatatsu, one more time.

1187
01:34:03,976 --> 01:34:04,977
<i>All right...</i>

1188
01:34:07,391 --> 01:34:08,559
<i>I feel it...</i>

1189
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:11,646
<i>Gamatatsu's chakra!</i>

1190
01:34:27,703 --> 01:34:30,873
<i>When he stores it up and spits it out...</i>

1191
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:44,637
Naruto, are you all right?!

1192
01:34:48,015 --> 01:34:51,640
I think I just got some sort of clue!

1193
01:34:52,902 --> 01:34:53,945
I see!

1194
01:34:55,309 --> 01:34:57,456
<i>Things have gotten interesting...</i>

1195
01:35:00,991 --> 01:35:05,257
All right! I've got to practice while
the sensation's still fresh...

1196
01:35:06,325 --> 01:35:07,910
Naruto!

1197
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:08,769
- Huh?
- Huh?

1198
01:35:13,207 --> 01:35:14,917
Oh! Sakura!

1199
01:35:15,118 --> 01:35:18,898
Come on! Don't waste your time here!

1200
01:35:22,866 --> 01:35:24,493
You smell terrible.

1201
01:35:24,836 --> 01:35:28,465
Anyway, why are you so sticky
and worn out?!

1202
01:35:28,514 --> 01:35:30,266
Well, umm, this is...

1203
01:35:30,808 --> 01:35:33,018
This is really important...

1204
01:35:33,018 --> 01:35:35,730
Anyway, everyone's tired
of waiting for you!

1205
01:35:35,856 --> 01:35:36,364
Let's go!

1206
01:35:36,389 --> 01:35:38,099
W-Wait a second, Sakura!

1207
01:35:38,232 --> 01:35:39,596
I need to practice right now--!

1208
01:35:39,621 --> 01:35:40,498
No excuses!

1209
01:35:41,461 --> 01:35:43,129
Gamakichi, Gamatatsu...

1210
01:35:43,237 --> 01:35:45,322
I'll call you again...!

1211
01:35:45,823 --> 01:35:47,158
Huh? Sure.

1212
01:35:47,158 --> 01:35:48,117
Work hard.

1213
01:35:48,117 --> 01:35:50,661
Big Brother, can I clean out my mouth?

1214
01:35:55,166 --> 01:35:55,707
Damn!

1215
01:35:56,083 --> 01:35:58,836
It looks like the rain
washed away the scent.

1216
01:36:00,337 --> 01:36:05,301
Don't be so pessimistic!
They're using bats to observe us.

1217
01:36:05,593 --> 01:36:07,906
We know that their base is around here,

1218
01:36:08,137 --> 01:36:11,640
or they were forced to stay here
for some reason.

1219
01:36:11,918 --> 01:36:16,464
You mean, there's a possibility
we'll have to face them?

1220
01:36:16,937 --> 01:36:17,646
Yes...

1221
01:36:17,773 --> 01:36:19,150
Oh, you're back...

1222
01:36:28,407 --> 01:36:30,409
Oh! You were able to find it!

1223
01:36:30,826 --> 01:36:32,411
We're really lucky.

1224
01:36:32,953 --> 01:36:36,415
I found a female insect that
survived with her eggs.

1225
01:36:36,946 --> 01:36:41,409
And they just hatched.
It's the next-generation of insects.

1226
01:36:42,046 --> 01:36:45,049
This insect is resistant to that jutsu?

1227
01:36:45,299 --> 01:36:48,344
There's a good possibility that
it has a high tolerance.

1228
01:36:48,803 --> 01:36:49,804
However...

1229
01:36:50,318 --> 01:36:51,987
The problem is, how many...

1230
01:36:52,211 --> 01:36:52,978
Right.

1231
01:36:54,225 --> 01:36:57,270
I thought you had some
great countermeasure against them.

1232
01:36:58,395 --> 01:37:01,440
Kakashi-sensei, we need more time.

1233
01:37:01,975 --> 01:37:02,976
What are you going to do?

1234
01:37:04,944 --> 01:37:07,655
I'm going to increase the number
of these insects... all at once.

1235
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:10,241
All right.

1236
01:37:10,783 --> 01:37:13,536
We need to have a countermeasure
as soon as possible.

1237
01:37:13,925 --> 01:37:14,926
Get on it right away.

1238
01:37:15,538 --> 01:37:16,539
All right.

1239
01:37:17,174 --> 01:37:18,175
Well...

1240
01:37:18,624 --> 01:37:20,125
What about us?

1241
01:37:21,234 --> 01:37:23,236
The enemy already knows about us.

1242
01:37:23,955 --> 01:37:26,374
They could take action
at any moment.

1243
01:37:27,468 --> 01:37:29,220
It's possible they'd leave

1244
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:33,697
to avoid wasting time contacting us
or provoking a fight...

1245
01:37:33,949 --> 01:37:35,057
In either case,

1246
01:37:35,057 --> 01:37:39,228
our mission is to capture the enemy
and obtain information.

1247
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:42,857
If we lose track of the enemy,

1248
01:37:43,159 --> 01:37:46,044
they may pose a
threat to the Hidden Leaf later.

1249
01:37:46,723 --> 01:37:48,215
We'll keep searching for the enemy.

1250
01:37:48,907 --> 01:37:49,709
Right.

1251
01:37:50,302 --> 01:37:51,679
It is time to leave.

1252
01:37:51,797 --> 01:37:54,090
Shino, try to catch up with me
very soon, okay?

1253
01:37:54,135 --> 01:37:55,052
Of course.

1254
01:37:55,103 --> 01:37:56,521
Good luck, Shino!

1255
01:38:06,881 --> 01:38:08,674
<i>Secret Jutsu: Insect Cocoon</i>

1256
01:38:20,853 --> 01:38:21,937
I'm back.

1257
01:38:22,271 --> 01:38:23,272
Guren!

1258
01:38:24,565 --> 01:38:28,235
I'm surprised a ragtag bunch
like you didn't betray me...

1259
01:38:28,611 --> 01:38:30,112
You know us better than that.

1260
01:38:30,404 --> 01:38:35,200
We decided to follow you
when we left the hideout.

1261
01:38:35,993 --> 01:38:39,496
Hey, which do you like better,
a red camellia or a white camellia?

1262
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:41,332
Who is he?

1263
01:38:41,582 --> 01:38:42,708
He's Yuukimaru,

1264
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:45,669
the one Lord Orochimaru asked us
to take good care of.

1265
01:38:45,836 --> 01:38:47,463
Lord Orochimaru said that?

1266
01:38:50,220 --> 01:38:51,805
Listen, guys!

1267
01:38:52,089 --> 01:38:55,218
Lord Orochimaru gave us
an important mission.

1268
01:38:55,437 --> 01:38:59,274
That is, we're responsible for
delivering him safely to the lake.

1269
01:38:59,610 --> 01:39:01,653
We can't afford to fail!

1270
01:39:03,352 --> 01:39:07,648
But... I know some strangers
are following us from the hideout.

1271
01:39:07,971 --> 01:39:10,349
That's just what
I'd expect from you, Guren.

1272
01:39:10,374 --> 01:39:12,125
You're already aware of them.

1273
01:39:12,387 --> 01:39:14,431
We've done some investigating too.

1274
01:39:14,763 --> 01:39:15,764
Tell me!

1275
01:39:16,016 --> 01:39:16,683
Right.

1276
01:39:16,992 --> 01:39:19,662
The enemy has four people
and one ninja Hound.

1277
01:39:20,030 --> 01:39:22,908
Gozu and I identified
ninja Hound paw prints.

1278
01:39:24,662 --> 01:39:28,332
Currently three people and one dog
are a couple of kilometers away,

1279
01:39:28,357 --> 01:39:30,985
and they're slowly heading towards us.

1280
01:39:31,420 --> 01:39:34,215
What?! What's wrong with Kihou's jutsu?

1281
01:39:34,416 --> 01:39:39,254
I'm sure Kihou's jutsu made
the ninja Hound's nose ineffective.

1282
01:39:39,566 --> 01:39:40,776
Because of that,

1283
01:39:41,009 --> 01:39:45,722
the Hidden Leaf Village sent
skilled trackers after the enemy.

1284
01:39:46,563 --> 01:39:48,941
As we expected,
the Hidden Leaf Village is our enemy...

1285
01:39:49,566 --> 01:39:50,567
What should we do?

1286
01:39:52,574 --> 01:39:53,658
I know just the thing.

1287
01:39:53,904 --> 01:39:57,825
I don't want them to
follow us anymore.

1288
01:39:58,742 --> 01:40:01,662
Find them! I'll defeat them here!

1289
01:40:04,790 --> 01:40:05,582
Did you find anything?

1290
01:40:05,624 --> 01:40:07,334
No. I didn't find anything.

1291
01:40:07,376 --> 01:40:08,377
Me neither.

1292
01:40:08,895 --> 01:40:10,730
Well... What should we do now?

1293
01:40:11,547 --> 01:40:14,174
We can't lose track of our enemy.

1294
01:40:15,009 --> 01:40:18,470
There's no guarantee we'll find them
after we lose track of them.

1295
01:40:19,013 --> 01:40:21,473
Since they know about us,

1296
01:40:21,515 --> 01:40:23,976
the chances of
a confrontation increase dramatically.

1297
01:40:25,436 --> 01:40:28,397
But it's better not to fight at this point.

1298
01:40:28,978 --> 01:40:32,398
That's why we had better
find them first.

1299
01:40:38,312 --> 01:40:42,191
Kiba, can you sniff out the bats' scent?

1300
01:40:42,619 --> 01:40:43,337
Huh?

1301
01:40:55,257 --> 01:40:56,258
Hey, just now...!

1302
01:40:57,722 --> 01:41:00,642
I have something to take care of.
You stay here and wait for me.

1303
01:41:02,347 --> 01:41:04,475
I'll come back here when I'm done.

1304
01:41:05,350 --> 01:41:06,852
Don't run around...

1305
01:41:07,227 --> 01:41:09,354
Lord Orochimaru asked me
to take care of you...

1306
01:41:10,355 --> 01:41:14,026
<i>Stay here and wait for me...
I'll come back to pick you up.</i>

1307
01:41:28,248 --> 01:41:29,007
But...

1308
01:41:30,084 --> 01:41:32,002
my mother never returned.

1309
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:33,545
Huh?

1310
01:41:34,088 --> 01:41:37,132
I wanted to see a red camellia...

1311
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:39,426
But that was not the right one...

1312
01:41:40,302 --> 01:41:42,596
Actually, that was a white camellia.

1313
01:41:43,251 --> 01:41:44,647
Everyone has left.

1314
01:41:45,766 --> 01:41:47,893
<i>Is he talking about his hometown?</i>

1315
01:41:52,022 --> 01:41:53,023
Here...

1316
01:41:53,190 --> 01:41:54,691
You... This is...!

1317
01:41:55,484 --> 01:41:56,985
I have this, so...

1318
01:41:57,569 --> 01:41:58,570
You know...

1319
01:41:58,737 --> 01:42:00,614
This one is for you, Guren.

1320
01:42:02,724 --> 01:42:04,059
You want to exchange it, right?

1321
01:42:04,284 --> 01:42:05,369
All right.

1322
01:42:12,515 --> 01:42:15,977
Kakashi-sensei, I smell something
at our two o'clock.

1323
01:42:16,371 --> 01:42:19,166
All right. We'll take a detour.

1324
01:42:19,424 --> 01:42:20,425
All right.

1325
01:42:21,925 --> 01:42:25,095
But I never thought we'd have
to slip past a formation of bats...

1326
01:42:25,889 --> 01:42:28,684
There's a limit on how far away
a bat can sense something.

1327
01:42:29,397 --> 01:42:31,608
There're many things to
shield us in the woods,

1328
01:42:31,687 --> 01:42:36,191
so if we keep a certain distance,
it won't be easy for them to find us.

1329
01:42:36,525 --> 01:42:37,526
I see...

1330
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:43,407
But we can't get completely out
of their search area...

1331
01:43:18,358 --> 01:43:22,196
It's bad luck to say that.
You think I'll die?

1332
01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:35,575
I sense him!
This is a ninja's chakra.

1333
01:43:39,309 --> 01:43:40,310
Look out!

1334
01:43:41,256 --> 01:43:43,300
So you're their leader!

1335
01:43:44,343 --> 01:43:45,677
Kakashi-sensei!

1336
01:43:52,346 --> 01:43:53,305
Sensei!

1337
01:43:53,363 --> 01:43:54,364
Don't, Kiba!

1338
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:56,882
What?!

1339
01:43:58,038 --> 01:43:59,707
I missed.

1340
01:43:59,775 --> 01:44:04,163
But since Gozu is taking care
of their boss,

1341
01:44:04,188 --> 01:44:06,023
it looks like things will be easy.

1342
01:44:07,763 --> 01:44:13,894
You've got quite the tracking ability...
It really is unfortunate.

1343
01:44:17,084 --> 01:44:19,920
Could it be... Is it them?

1344
01:44:20,170 --> 01:44:21,880
Yeah. Probably...

1345
01:44:22,339 --> 01:44:24,549
They were in that hideout.

1346
01:44:28,170 --> 01:44:30,005
Be careful, okay?

1347
01:44:30,030 --> 01:44:32,574
Okay. We're up against three of them.

1348
01:44:32,599 --> 01:44:33,725
What should we do, Kiba?

1349
01:44:34,685 --> 01:44:37,551
Akamaru and my jutsu are linked.

1350
01:44:37,980 --> 01:44:42,484
We've got to defeat one of them first
and reduce their numbers.

1351
01:44:43,068 --> 01:44:44,236
And after that?

1352
01:44:44,653 --> 01:44:47,364
It would be good if we could
defeat them by ourselves,

1353
01:44:47,364 --> 01:44:52,353
but our best bet is to stall for time
until Kakashi-sensei gets here.

1354
01:44:53,645 --> 01:44:54,555
Okay.

1355
01:44:56,204 --> 01:44:59,249
We need to go after one
of the two in front...

1356
01:44:59,710 --> 01:45:01,712
But from what I can see,
we should avoid that masked guy.

1357
01:45:01,712 --> 01:45:03,297
He looks like he's hiding something.

1358
01:45:05,385 --> 01:45:06,469
Which means...

1359
01:45:07,739 --> 01:45:08,897
Let's go, Akamaru!

1360
01:45:14,891 --> 01:45:16,226
<i>Fang Over Fang!</i>

1361
01:45:19,771 --> 01:45:21,273
Kigiri, smoke screen!

1362
01:45:25,541 --> 01:45:26,235
Kiba!

1363
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:31,575
Crap! Poison Smoke?!

1364
01:45:33,870 --> 01:45:36,290
I see. Thank you, Akamaru!

1365
01:45:37,489 --> 01:45:39,552
<i>But does the fact that
it's not poisonous...</i>

1366
01:45:39,577 --> 01:45:41,412
<i>mean that it's just a diversion?</i>

1367
01:45:45,714 --> 01:45:47,507
<i>What--?! What's this?!</i>

1368
01:45:48,633 --> 01:45:52,846
All the scents around me... are gone?

1369
01:45:54,139 --> 01:45:55,349
<i>I see.</i>

1370
01:45:55,349 --> 01:45:59,686
<i>They use this to erase traces
of their movements...</i>

1371
01:46:10,009 --> 01:46:10,962
<i>This is bad...</i>

1372
01:46:11,281 --> 01:46:14,076
<i>Aside from the fact that I can't see,
I can't smell anything either...</i>

1373
01:46:16,119 --> 01:46:19,089
<i>Wait. It should be the same
for our enemies as well.</i>

1374
01:46:19,410 --> 01:46:24,030
<i>So how do they know exactly
where I am?!</i>

1375
01:46:26,767 --> 01:46:28,242
Go, Nurari!

1376
01:46:37,057 --> 01:46:37,936
<i>They're going to get me!</i>

1377
01:46:40,805 --> 01:46:41,575
Duck!

1378
01:46:46,608 --> 01:46:47,461
Hinata?!

1379
01:46:52,744 --> 01:46:53,995
Stand back, Kiba!

1380
01:46:54,603 --> 01:46:55,604
I'll handle this...

1381
01:47:00,906 --> 01:47:02,491
Be careful, Hinata!

1382
01:47:02,545 --> 01:47:07,592
I'm not sure how,
but they can move freely in this smoke!

1383
01:47:07,933 --> 01:47:08,976
It's all right!

1384
01:47:09,047 --> 01:47:11,100
Even if they take away my sense
of sight and smell,

1385
01:47:11,364 --> 01:47:13,100
they cannot take away my Byakugan!

1386
01:47:18,550 --> 01:47:19,551
All right.

1387
01:47:20,725 --> 01:47:21,726
Stand back, Akamaru!

1388
01:47:30,193 --> 01:47:32,479
I'm your opponent...

1389
01:47:45,333 --> 01:47:49,629
What?! Could it be that even
in this smoke screen...?

1390
01:47:49,913 --> 01:47:53,325
That's right.
I can see all of your attacks!

1391
01:47:58,305 --> 01:47:59,389
Right here!

1392
01:48:06,356 --> 01:48:07,732
Just kidding.

1393
01:48:14,640 --> 01:48:15,975
<i>It can't be! I missed?!</i>

1394
01:48:25,511 --> 01:48:28,305
<i>That's impossible. But how?!</i>

1395
01:48:30,107 --> 01:48:30,859
<i>What's this...?</i>

1396
01:48:39,466 --> 01:48:40,666
<i>What strength!</i>

1397
01:48:51,441 --> 01:48:53,610
Die!

1398
01:49:06,039 --> 01:49:07,624
A Shadow Clone...

1399
01:49:07,624 --> 01:49:08,712
Correct.

1400
01:49:10,293 --> 01:49:14,506
I can't fight someone as
dangerous as you right away.

1401
01:49:15,632 --> 01:49:18,301
You've enhanced your muscles
to their limit.

1402
01:49:18,635 --> 01:49:20,512
Did Orochimaru do that for you?

1403
01:49:22,806 --> 01:49:25,976
Even if you run away,
you can't defeat me.

1404
01:49:26,476 --> 01:49:27,602
From what I can see,

1405
01:49:27,602 --> 01:49:29,813
your weapons are your speed
and your strength.

1406
01:49:29,813 --> 01:49:34,442
You've got destructive power,
but I specialize in predicting movements.

1407
01:49:34,901 --> 01:49:38,863
There's no point in resisting.
You're coming back to the village with us.

1408
01:49:41,074 --> 01:49:42,117
I refuse.

1409
01:49:53,169 --> 01:49:54,921
It looks like it's begun...

1410
01:49:55,338 --> 01:49:58,675
First, I need to see how skilled
my enemies and allies are.

1411
01:49:59,676 --> 01:50:03,638
I should take action as well...

1412
01:50:15,353 --> 01:50:16,610
How unfortunate.

1413
01:50:16,610 --> 01:50:19,404
Even though you can see me,
it's pointless.

1414
01:50:21,781 --> 01:50:25,452
<i>Something's surrounding his body...</i>

1415
01:50:26,703 --> 01:50:29,039
<i>That's why he's not affected,</i>

1416
01:50:29,039 --> 01:50:30,832
<i>no matter how much chakra
I hit him with...</i>

1417
01:50:33,710 --> 01:50:36,338
It seems that you use
the Gentle Fist.

1418
01:50:36,338 --> 01:50:38,214
I'm a bad match for you.

1419
01:50:40,675 --> 01:50:43,928
Do you want that boy to help you?

1420
01:50:47,025 --> 01:50:51,279
<i>No. If I call for Kiba,
I'll be playing right into his hands...</i>

1421
01:51:03,518 --> 01:51:04,519
Hinata!

1422
01:51:14,513 --> 01:51:17,558
<i>Crap! Isn't there something I can do?!</i>

1423
01:51:32,227 --> 01:51:33,228
That's it!

1424
01:51:33,412 --> 01:51:37,124
This just might work!
Let's go, Akamaru!

1425
01:51:51,547 --> 01:51:52,327
Over here!

1426
01:52:06,928 --> 01:52:08,388
<i>He's even faster than before...</i>

1427
01:52:16,563 --> 01:52:20,400
<i>But his attacks are straightforward!
They're easy to read!</i>

1428
01:52:24,904 --> 01:52:25,905
What?!

1429
01:52:29,752 --> 01:52:30,753
Will I make it?!

1430
01:52:49,589 --> 01:52:51,650
Finish her off, Nurari!

1431
01:52:52,997 --> 01:52:53,932
Understood.

1432
01:53:07,370 --> 01:53:08,371
Wh-What's this...?!

1433
01:53:12,787 --> 01:53:14,579
Once more!

1434
01:53:14,579 --> 01:53:16,113
<i>Fang Over Fang!</i>

1435
01:53:18,458 --> 01:53:19,515
K-Kiba...?

1436
01:53:37,769 --> 01:53:39,521
What is this?!

1437
01:53:39,854 --> 01:53:40,599
Hinata!

1438
01:53:42,941 --> 01:53:45,443
Sorry I'm late.

1439
01:53:47,278 --> 01:53:49,489
H-Hey, are you all right?

1440
01:53:50,949 --> 01:53:53,201
Kiba, how did you find me?

1441
01:53:53,201 --> 01:53:56,563
Well, I used the spin of
my Fang Over Fang

1442
01:53:56,588 --> 01:53:58,339
to stir the air around me.

1443
01:53:58,521 --> 01:54:04,527
Once the air circulation improved,
that annoying smoke cleared up.

1444
01:54:06,047 --> 01:54:09,133
With my sense of sight and smell back,
we've got the advantage.

1445
01:54:09,384 --> 01:54:11,803
You may have done
whatever you wanted before,

1446
01:54:11,803 --> 01:54:14,403
but prepare yourselves!

1447
01:54:15,765 --> 01:54:17,756
Are you sure you're not the ones
who should be prepared?

1448
01:54:25,735 --> 01:54:28,947
Crap! Others were waiting
to ambush us...?

1449
01:54:29,487 --> 01:54:30,768
Too bad.

1450
01:54:40,874 --> 01:54:44,669
Well, now that we know all about you...

1451
01:54:45,336 --> 01:54:47,213
We're going to kill them
with our next attack!

1452
01:54:47,422 --> 01:54:48,428
- Understood!
- Understood!

1453
01:54:52,781 --> 01:54:53,630
What?!

1454
01:54:56,097 --> 01:54:57,682
That's impossible...

1455
01:55:06,065 --> 01:55:08,387
<i>This feeling. We're surrounded...</i>

1456
01:55:09,652 --> 01:55:11,321
Hey, man?!

1457
01:55:11,321 --> 01:55:14,449
Kigiri, a smoke screen! Retreat!

1458
01:55:14,850 --> 01:55:15,478
What?!

1459
01:55:20,371 --> 01:55:22,916
What the hell are they doing?

1460
01:55:22,916 --> 01:55:27,045
It seems that the enemy
has good senses as well.

1461
01:55:32,988 --> 01:55:33,898
Shino!

1462
01:55:34,998 --> 01:55:36,838
How unfortunate...

1463
01:55:42,091 --> 01:55:46,220
I was just about to finish casting
a net around them...

1464
01:55:50,735 --> 01:55:51,923
Is everyone all right?

1465
01:55:52,772 --> 01:55:53,801
Kakashi-sensei!

1466
01:55:54,989 --> 01:55:56,950
We're all together.

1467
01:55:57,200 --> 01:55:59,577
Yeah. But Hinata is...

1468
01:56:00,244 --> 01:56:02,288
How is it? Can you move?

1469
01:56:04,123 --> 01:56:05,959
Yes, somewhat...

1470
01:56:10,088 --> 01:56:12,842
Sensei, did you get that big guy?

1471
01:56:15,376 --> 01:56:16,105
No...

1472
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:18,421
I couldn't get him...

1473
01:56:19,138 --> 01:56:20,065
I see...

1474
01:56:22,058 --> 01:56:24,002
They got away from us too.

1475
01:56:25,687 --> 01:56:28,350
Then the battle's not over yet.

1476
01:56:29,997 --> 01:56:33,423
There should be
another jutsu user nearby...

1477
01:56:35,242 --> 01:56:37,156
Oh? How interesting.

1478
01:56:37,740 --> 01:56:42,424
I never expected to be pursued by
the Copy Ninja, Kakashi...

1479
01:56:43,162 --> 01:56:46,625
It may have been too much
for Gozu and Rinji.

1480
01:56:48,918 --> 01:56:53,667
My preparation went well.
I guess it's my turn!

1481
01:57:51,314 --> 01:57:52,356
Mother...

1482
01:58:00,716 --> 01:58:01,366
Halt!

1483
01:58:07,300 --> 01:58:11,138
If things were going according to plan,
he would have left some sign.

1484
01:58:11,959 --> 01:58:14,962
I didn't see anything like that...

1485
01:58:15,399 --> 01:58:19,484
Man! They better not have forgotten
about the group behind them!

1486
01:58:19,688 --> 01:58:21,229
They're not you, you know!

1487
01:58:21,715 --> 01:58:24,203
We should assume something happened
to the search team!

1488
01:58:24,806 --> 01:58:26,179
- Sai.
- Yes?

1489
01:58:27,058 --> 01:58:29,060
Can you do reconnaissance from the sky?

1490
01:58:29,588 --> 01:58:30,530
Understood.

1491
01:58:33,785 --> 01:58:35,622
<i>Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll</i>

1492
01:58:41,948 --> 01:58:44,367
<i>We've got some time
until Sai comes back.</i>

1493
01:58:45,378 --> 01:58:47,339
Wait for me here a while.

1494
01:58:47,554 --> 01:58:49,931
We're on duty!
Where do you think you're going?

1495
01:58:49,956 --> 01:58:51,707
I've have to pee!

1496
01:58:52,458 --> 01:58:53,306
Good grief!

1497
01:59:00,591 --> 01:59:03,177
I don't see anything that looks
like the search team.

1498
01:59:16,275 --> 01:59:17,107
Camellia?

1499
01:59:26,576 --> 01:59:29,954
I'd better take this chance to review
my training some more...

1500
01:59:30,204 --> 01:59:32,528
I've forgotten the timing I had earlier.

1501
01:59:35,084 --> 01:59:36,303
Huh? What's that?!

1502
01:59:55,099 --> 01:59:56,737
You're that kid I saw the other day!

1503
02:00:02,617 --> 02:00:06,746
It is you, after all...
What are you doing here?

1504
02:00:08,284 --> 02:00:14,832
Not all camellia trees are short.
Some that grow in the wild are this tall.

1505
02:00:15,324 --> 02:00:16,626
What are you talking about?

1506
02:00:16,651 --> 02:00:18,945
It's me!
You know, from the hot springs!

1507
02:00:20,379 --> 02:00:23,090
Everyone has someplace to go home to.

1508
02:00:23,674 --> 02:00:26,719
Wherever someone's thinking of you,
that's where you go home to.

1509
02:00:26,948 --> 02:00:29,609
Isn't that what I taught you?

1510
02:00:31,680 --> 02:00:34,330
Never mind that, though.
You're alone, aren't you?

1511
02:00:34,883 --> 02:00:36,551
Where are your friends? Your family?

1512
02:00:38,397 --> 02:00:42,276
The white camellias turned... red...

1513
02:00:42,783 --> 02:00:48,157
Then they disappeared... All of them.

1514
02:00:49,228 --> 02:00:51,126
Just as I thought, you're all alone,
aren't you?

1515
02:00:52,430 --> 02:00:54,767
If that's the case,
do you want to come with us?!

1516
02:00:57,570 --> 02:00:59,484
Come with us to our hometown.

1517
02:01:00,270 --> 02:01:02,022
We're on a mission right now,

1518
02:01:02,134 --> 02:01:04,344
but when we're done,
we'll come back for you.

1519
02:01:08,747 --> 02:01:11,848
<i>Something just came up. Wait here.</i>

1520
02:01:13,753 --> 02:01:14,789
I have to wait...

1521
02:01:16,060 --> 02:01:16,580
Huh?!

1522
02:01:17,603 --> 02:01:21,482
Where there's someone thinking of me,
that's where I go home to.

1523
02:01:21,524 --> 02:01:23,025
Yes, that's right!

1524
02:01:24,944 --> 02:01:29,031
Is there anyone thinking of me?
I hope there is.

1525
02:01:30,324 --> 02:01:33,244
Could it be that
there's someone thinking of you?

1526
02:01:39,361 --> 02:01:43,084
When I had a fever, that person
stayed up all night caring for me.

1527
02:01:43,921 --> 02:01:47,633
I see! That shows that person
was thinking of you!

1528
02:01:49,051 --> 02:01:50,261
I hope so...

1529
02:01:51,304 --> 02:01:55,391
Listen, follow that person!
Don't let that person go!

1530
02:01:56,225 --> 02:01:56,967
Uh-huh.

1531
02:01:59,783 --> 02:02:01,785
- Shino's insect?!
- Naruto...

1532
02:02:03,284 --> 02:02:05,176
Sorry. I'm on a mission...

1533
02:02:06,675 --> 02:02:08,446
Huh?! Where'd he go?!

1534
02:02:09,905 --> 02:02:13,200
Oh well, it seems he has
a place to go home to.

1535
02:02:14,261 --> 02:02:17,220
We found Shino's parasitic insects!
We need to pursue them immediately.

1536
02:02:17,702 --> 02:02:18,331
Right.

1537
02:02:18,456 --> 02:02:20,291
What took you so long?!

1538
02:02:22,585 --> 02:02:25,463
Sorry... I ran into someone I knew.

1539
02:02:26,901 --> 02:02:28,444
He's lying, of course.

1540
02:02:28,674 --> 02:02:31,177
There's no way he'd run into
someone he knew out here.

1541
02:02:31,385 --> 02:02:33,846
He was really there, I'm telling you!

1542
02:02:33,888 --> 02:02:35,806
A boy about this tall and...

1543
02:02:42,873 --> 02:02:45,584
Humph, you're a pitiful lot!

1544
02:02:46,031 --> 02:02:49,362
We're ashamed.
Those guys were quite skilled...

1545
02:02:49,570 --> 02:02:53,240
Well, because of that,
we got a look at what they can do.

1546
02:02:54,492 --> 02:02:56,702
Kakashi's about the only troublesome one.

1547
02:02:56,944 --> 02:02:59,538
The first thing we need to do
is stop Kakashi.

1548
02:03:00,122 --> 02:03:04,543
We can't let those guys interfere
with Lord Orochimaru's plans.

1549
02:03:05,586 --> 02:03:07,088
I'll see to the rest...

1550
02:03:16,031 --> 02:03:17,741
<i>The trap is looking good...</i>

1551
02:03:24,647 --> 02:03:26,440
<i>The seed of the Octangular Jade Crystal</i>

1552
02:03:26,465 --> 02:03:28,759
<i>placed in the 8 Trigrams
Octagonal Formation.</i>

1553
02:03:28,859 --> 02:03:31,654
<i>When this shines, the light
inside the Jade Crystal</i>

1554
02:03:31,695 --> 02:03:34,740
<i>will bounce around,
trapped for all eternity.</i>

1555
02:03:37,034 --> 02:03:40,413
Blossom!
<i>Crystal Style: Jade Crystal Labyrinth!</i>

1556
02:04:03,144 --> 02:04:05,062
Shino?! Can you follow it?!

1557
02:04:05,925 --> 02:04:06,728
No problem.

1558
02:04:10,443 --> 02:04:14,280
Because the only place where
the Parasitic Insects' net was not complete

1559
02:04:14,321 --> 02:04:17,241
was in this ten o'clock direction.

1560
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:23,747
Yeah, looks like we'll have to
determine their objective.

1561
02:04:24,248 --> 02:04:27,042
- Then, let's go.
- No, hold on.

1562
02:04:27,177 --> 02:04:28,377
What is it, Shino?!

1563
02:04:29,975 --> 02:04:31,872
The Parasitic Insects are
behaving strangely...

1564
02:04:32,243 --> 02:04:34,240
It's as though they can't
find their way out.

1565
02:04:34,675 --> 02:04:35,935
What do you mean?

1566
02:04:36,507 --> 02:04:38,148
How do I describe it...?

1567
02:04:38,173 --> 02:04:40,834
The Parasitic Insects seem to
have lost all of their senses

1568
02:04:40,859 --> 02:04:42,283
and seem to be wandering aimlessly.

1569
02:04:42,308 --> 02:04:43,893
Could it be some sort of genjutsu?

1570
02:04:44,477 --> 02:04:47,229
They didn't use anything
except physical attacks.

1571
02:04:47,480 --> 02:04:51,692
No, it's also possible that
they simply chose not to use it on us.

1572
02:04:52,178 --> 02:04:54,472
You mean they kept their secrets hidden?

1573
02:04:54,643 --> 02:04:58,313
Hinata, check to see if
there is a Sealing jutsu or a barrier.

1574
02:04:58,834 --> 02:04:59,453
Will do.

1575
02:05:00,606 --> 02:05:01,141
<i>Byakugan!</i>

1576
02:05:13,787 --> 02:05:14,913
What's the matter, Hinata?!

1577
02:05:15,331 --> 02:05:19,110
Infinite... images... of us...

1578
02:05:19,803 --> 02:05:21,388
The Byakugan was overcome?

1579
02:05:28,187 --> 02:05:30,188
<i>Crystal Style: Jade Crystal Mirror</i>

1580
02:05:38,962 --> 02:05:41,247
Lovely as always...

1581
02:05:41,567 --> 02:05:43,164
<i>Jade Crystal Clone Jutsu</i>

1582
02:05:58,008 --> 02:06:01,679
Seems they were sealed
within some sort of barrier.

1583
02:06:02,054 --> 02:06:04,754
We thought we had the enemy sealed off
with the Parasitic Insects.

1584
02:06:05,140 --> 02:06:08,227
But their outer perimeter was further off,
is that it?

1585
02:06:10,585 --> 02:06:11,135
The enemy!

1586
02:06:14,712 --> 02:06:15,289
Scatter!

1587
02:06:28,789 --> 02:06:30,457
<i>Crystal Style: Jade Crystal Blade!</i>

1588
02:07:00,081 --> 02:07:02,282
<i>So it's a jutsu that
crystallizes material...</i>

1589
02:07:02,906 --> 02:07:05,562
<i>If it crystallizes the moisture in the air,</i>

1590
02:07:06,046 --> 02:07:07,812
<i>there are an infinite number
of weapons to use for attacks.</i>

1591
02:07:08,490 --> 02:07:11,457
We can't let this battle draw out.

1592
02:07:13,334 --> 02:07:15,168
Kakashi the Copy Ninja...

1593
02:07:15,570 --> 02:07:19,073
So that's your Sharingan...
But it's no use.

1594
02:07:20,341 --> 02:07:22,760
My Crystal Style cannot be copied.

1595
02:07:31,191 --> 02:07:33,812
It's no use! I can't use Byakugan.

1596
02:07:34,150 --> 02:07:36,232
I hear you've got good eyes...

1597
02:07:36,857 --> 02:07:40,861
But inside my Jade Crystal,
light is refracted.

1598
02:07:40,861 --> 02:07:43,447
Your good eyesight works against you.

1599
02:07:44,365 --> 02:07:46,033
I have more than just Byakugan!

1600
02:07:50,232 --> 02:07:52,625
You want to fight me face-to-face?

1601
02:07:52,888 --> 02:07:55,751
What can you do with your eyes sealed?

1602
02:07:56,165 --> 02:07:57,946
<i>For a long time...</i>

1603
02:07:58,524 --> 02:08:02,591
<i>I've trained as hard I could
so Naruto would acknowledge my ability.</i>

1604
02:08:03,494 --> 02:08:05,642
Are you that anxious to die?

1605
02:08:06,124 --> 02:08:08,749
<i>I might not be at
my cousin Neji's level, but I...</i>

1606
02:08:10,557 --> 02:08:12,351
<i>Concentrate only on the enemy...</i>

1607
02:08:26,755 --> 02:08:29,675
<i>Gentle Fist 8 Trigrams 32 Palms!</i>

1608
02:08:32,621 --> 02:08:34,832
<i>8 Trigrams 2 Palms! 4 Palms!</i>

1609
02:08:36,375 --> 02:08:37,584
<i>8 Palms!</i>

1610
02:08:41,296 --> 02:08:42,548
<i>16 Palms!</i>

1611
02:08:43,966 --> 02:08:45,259
<i>32 Palms!</i>

1612
02:08:51,724 --> 02:08:52,725
It worked!

1613
02:09:01,316 --> 02:09:03,694
<i>Crystal Style: Jade Crystal Prison!</i>

1614
02:09:20,753 --> 02:09:21,962
What's happening?!

1615
02:09:28,135 --> 02:09:30,804
- What happened?
- She just up and left.

1616
02:09:32,014 --> 02:09:34,558
The same thing happened with me.
Where's Hinata?

1617
02:09:34,933 --> 02:09:36,977
Here's your friend.

1618
02:09:40,939 --> 02:09:41,670
Hinata!

1619
02:09:42,608 --> 02:09:43,214
Damn!

1620
02:09:50,449 --> 02:09:51,950
What the hell is this?!

1621
02:09:52,834 --> 02:09:53,779
Crystals...

1622
02:09:55,049 --> 02:10:00,137
This is unmistakably the enemy's jutsu.
And it seems huge.

1623
02:10:00,751 --> 02:10:03,337
- Sai!
- Right! Gotcha.

1624
02:10:22,689 --> 02:10:23,857
Just as I thought.

1625
02:10:24,608 --> 02:10:26,443
I think it's about a kilometer across.

1626
02:10:27,194 --> 02:10:28,737
One kilometer...

1627
02:10:28,737 --> 02:10:30,614
It must be the work of
someone very skilled.

1628
02:10:30,864 --> 02:10:32,658
Let's break it down right away.

1629
02:10:32,991 --> 02:10:36,870
Hold on a minute, Naruto.
There's a kind of barrier here.

1630
02:10:37,112 --> 02:10:39,531
We can't risk the possibility
that it's been rigged somehow...

1631
02:10:48,757 --> 02:10:52,761
It's okay. It doesn't react to
an attack from outside.

1632
02:10:53,383 --> 02:10:56,428
Kakashi-senpai and the others
must be trapped inside.

1633
02:10:57,809 --> 02:10:59,853
If they're only trapped
inside, that's fine.

1634
02:11:00,028 --> 02:11:02,852
But if there's a trap set up inside,
this is going to be trouble.

1635
02:11:03,272 --> 02:11:06,942
Captain Yamato,
can't we just break through the wall

1636
02:11:06,989 --> 02:11:09,116
the way we did when we snuck
into Orochimaru's hideout?

1637
02:11:09,453 --> 02:11:12,339
I'm afraid that this crystal possesses

1638
02:11:12,707 --> 02:11:15,971
an extremely tight structure
at the molecular level.

1639
02:11:16,823 --> 02:11:19,936
Unlike the clay wall,
there are no weak spots.

1640
02:11:21,623 --> 02:11:24,513
But... if we went from underground...

1641
02:11:34,720 --> 02:11:39,182
Even the ground itself is encased in
crystal. There are no weak spots at all.

1642
02:11:39,850 --> 02:11:41,518
It appears very strong.

1643
02:11:41,560 --> 02:11:44,187
It doesn't look like we could break it
with a jutsu concentrated at one point.

1644
02:11:44,229 --> 02:11:45,272
I agree...

1645
02:11:45,414 --> 02:11:48,834
With something this large,
the force would be dispersed equally,

1646
02:11:48,859 --> 02:11:50,485
weakening the power of the attack.

1647
02:11:50,904 --> 02:11:54,006
Yes. It would have to be
a jutsu that could do

1648
02:11:54,031 --> 02:11:55,991
both widespread and powerful damage...

1649
02:11:56,493 --> 02:11:58,620
- Sounds like fun!
- You mustn't, Naruto!

1650
02:11:59,494 --> 02:12:03,415
I'll be fine, Sakura.
I won't use that jutsu.

1651
02:12:04,181 --> 02:12:06,725
Let me try out a jutsu
I've been working on!

1652
02:12:07,572 --> 02:12:08,575
Naruto...

1653
02:12:15,302 --> 02:12:16,561
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

1654
02:12:18,909 --> 02:12:20,936
- Yo!
- We've been summoned!

1655
02:12:21,475 --> 02:12:22,935
What? Summoning?

1656
02:12:22,935 --> 02:12:26,271
Oh... you can do
the Summoning Jutsu, Naruto?

1657
02:12:27,034 --> 02:12:28,828
What are you going to do
with Summoning Jutsu?

1658
02:12:30,150 --> 02:12:31,860
Just watch and see!

1659
02:12:32,611 --> 02:12:33,862
Here's what we're going to do!

1660
02:12:33,862 --> 02:12:36,823
We haven't perfected it yet,
but it's all we've got!

1661
02:12:41,541 --> 02:12:45,336
Light sealed inside the Jade Crystal
can never get out.

1662
02:12:46,502 --> 02:12:47,668
Don't move!

1663
02:12:52,606 --> 02:12:55,025
If you guys follow us around any longer,

1664
02:12:55,050 --> 02:12:58,553
your friend will end up
as shattered shards of light!

1665
02:13:02,766 --> 02:13:04,434
I'm ready to go.

1666
02:13:04,876 --> 02:13:05,744
Okay listen.

1667
02:13:05,769 --> 02:13:08,855
Use the timing we worked on earlier
to pour in the chakra.

1668
02:13:09,003 --> 02:13:09,818
Right.

1669
02:13:10,107 --> 02:13:12,192
What are they going to do?

1670
02:13:12,870 --> 02:13:15,195
Well, let's see what they've got.

1671
02:13:16,759 --> 02:13:17,968
Let's do it, Gamatatsu!

1672
02:13:20,659 --> 02:13:25,706
Mold chakra in your stomach
and inhale through the nose!

1673
02:13:27,582 --> 02:13:30,794
Hold it in... then
exhale it out all at once.

1674
02:13:31,211 --> 02:13:32,212
Now!

1675
02:13:32,254 --> 02:13:34,047
<i>Wind Style: Toad Water Pistol!</i>

1676
02:13:45,368 --> 02:13:46,117
What?!

1677
02:13:52,357 --> 02:13:56,737
They broke the barrier.
They're not bad.

1678
02:13:57,279 --> 02:13:58,280
Guren...

1679
02:13:58,405 --> 02:14:00,115
Huh? H-Hey!

1680
02:14:03,910 --> 02:14:04,911
Kakashi-sensei!

1681
02:14:05,787 --> 02:14:07,247
Humph! Back up, huh?

1682
02:14:07,748 --> 02:14:09,249
Is everybody all right?

1683
02:14:09,750 --> 02:14:11,084
Naruto, what was that...?

1684
02:14:11,501 --> 02:14:14,713
That was collaboration ninjutsu with
a toad. We learned it from Pervy Sage.

1685
02:14:15,172 --> 02:14:16,173
Oh...!

1686
02:14:16,582 --> 02:14:21,170
Now, it's my turn!
You have nowhere to run!

1687
02:14:22,429 --> 02:14:25,599
Here comes that really loud guy!

1688
02:14:26,726 --> 02:14:27,414
Hinata!

1689
02:14:28,770 --> 02:14:31,188
You! What did you do to Hinata?!

1690
02:14:34,483 --> 02:14:36,359
What are you going to do,
Kakashi-sensei?!

1691
02:14:37,063 --> 02:14:40,697
We can't attack them recklessly
since Hinata has been taken hostage.

1692
02:14:41,332 --> 02:14:46,713
Besides, any small shock will
cause that crystal to shatter.

1693
02:14:47,329 --> 02:14:48,580
What a mess.

1694
02:14:50,123 --> 02:14:52,417
- Sai, wait for your chance...
- You realize your situation,

1695
02:14:52,459 --> 02:14:54,044
- to attack from the sky.
- So just return to the Leaf!

1696
02:14:54,044 --> 02:14:54,711
Right!

1697
02:14:54,784 --> 02:14:57,704
- Gamatatsu, can you do that once more?
- If you go back, I'll let this kid go.

1698
02:14:57,839 --> 02:15:00,050
Yeah... Just one more time...

1699
02:15:00,801 --> 02:15:04,346
I must control my Wind chakra
so Hinata won't get hurt.

1700
02:15:07,877 --> 02:15:08,627
Freeze!

1701
02:15:08,850 --> 02:15:10,477
- Now, Gamatatsu!
- Stop, Naruto!

1702
02:15:10,502 --> 02:15:12,462
<i>Wind Style: Toad Water Pistol!</i>

1703
02:15:17,442 --> 02:15:18,110
What?!

1704
02:15:18,401 --> 02:15:21,822
My Crystal Style can
crystallize all materials.

1705
02:15:22,149 --> 02:15:25,152
You need ten more years of experience
before you can challenge me.

1706
02:15:25,835 --> 02:15:28,254
<i>Crystal Style:
Burst Crystal Falling Dragon</i>

1707
02:15:31,612 --> 02:15:32,739
Gamatatsu, run away!

1708
02:15:36,322 --> 02:15:37,615
Is everyone safe?

1709
02:15:38,056 --> 02:15:38,619
- Yes!
- Yes!

1710
02:15:41,216 --> 02:15:43,802
Damn it! What was that?!

1711
02:15:44,138 --> 02:15:47,475
She crystallized your jutsu
and turned it into her own jutsu.

1712
02:15:48,640 --> 02:15:51,059
Listen, Naruto! I'll get her attention.

1713
02:15:51,369 --> 02:15:54,539
You protect Hinata,
then pull out from the battle!

1714
02:15:54,813 --> 02:15:58,483
- What?!
- Hinata's life is the top priority right now.

1715
02:15:59,471 --> 02:16:00,012
Right.

1716
02:16:00,569 --> 02:16:05,949
It's useless to hide.
Don't forget I have a hostage!

1717
02:16:14,369 --> 02:16:15,745
They seem to have given up.

1718
02:16:16,442 --> 02:16:19,821
Let Hinata go.
Take me as your hostage instead.

1719
02:16:20,049 --> 02:16:20,633
What?!

1720
02:16:20,839 --> 02:16:22,257
That's wishful thinking!

1721
02:16:30,265 --> 02:16:31,241
Now, Naruto!

1722
02:16:31,609 --> 02:16:32,478
Gamatatsu!

1723
02:16:37,647 --> 02:16:38,523
I won't let you get away!

1724
02:16:46,265 --> 02:16:48,601
Damn it! My clothes are so filthy now.

1725
02:16:49,743 --> 02:16:50,538
Guren!

1726
02:16:52,704 --> 02:16:54,497
- Are you all right?
- Yeah...

1727
02:16:54,956 --> 02:16:56,416
I'm relieved.

1728
02:16:57,966 --> 02:17:03,597
I must say, they ran away rather quickly.
Rinji, don't lose track of them!

1729
02:17:03,924 --> 02:17:04,571
All right.

1730
02:17:05,634 --> 02:17:08,970
All right, Gamatatsu,
you can bring Hinata out now.

1731
02:17:10,453 --> 02:17:13,706
Gamatatsu! Gently, gently!

1732
02:17:19,845 --> 02:17:22,055
Gently, gently.

1733
02:17:24,185 --> 02:17:27,605
Good! Just like that, slowly, slowly.

1734
02:17:29,068 --> 02:17:29,841
Oh!

1735
02:17:30,478 --> 02:17:31,346
A fly!

1736
02:17:33,268 --> 02:17:33,893
Hinata!

1737
02:17:34,316 --> 02:17:36,943
You fool! What are you doing, idiot?!

1738
02:17:37,652 --> 02:17:38,227
Huh?!

1739
02:17:39,376 --> 02:17:42,646
No! Stop! Please stop!

1740
02:17:42,671 --> 02:17:43,344
Hinata!

1741
02:17:43,668 --> 02:17:44,669
Hinata!

1742
02:17:49,135 --> 02:17:50,637
It... stopped...

1743
02:17:50,965 --> 02:17:53,259
Damn! We're too late...

1744
02:17:54,099 --> 02:17:54,955
Pakkun!

1745
02:17:57,354 --> 02:17:59,981
They finished analyzing
Shino's Parasitic Insect.

1746
02:18:00,647 --> 02:18:03,483
It appears the enemy's jutsu
was definitely the Crystal Style.

1747
02:18:03,985 --> 02:18:05,278
Just as we suspected...

1748
02:18:05,609 --> 02:18:08,075
And the analyst confirmed

1749
02:18:08,100 --> 02:18:11,270
that several materials from the crystal
encased the Parasitic Insect.

1750
02:18:11,907 --> 02:18:15,911
It was true what she said about it
crystallizing all materials.

1751
02:18:16,691 --> 02:18:21,530
Sai's Super Beast Scroll was also
crystallized. It's a troublesome jutsu.

1752
02:18:21,960 --> 02:18:26,339
Not only the jutsu
itself, but also its effects.

1753
02:18:27,063 --> 02:18:29,274
- So, that means...
- Right...

1754
02:18:29,592 --> 02:18:33,013
They said that even the biological fluid
of the Parasitic Insect was crystallized.

1755
02:18:33,327 --> 02:18:34,578
What?! Then...

1756
02:18:34,732 --> 02:18:38,653
And Hinata?
Is Hinata all right, Kakashi-sensei?

1757
02:18:38,930 --> 02:18:39,973
Y-Yeah...

1758
02:18:40,770 --> 02:18:43,189
We should take her
to the village immediately.

1759
02:18:43,606 --> 02:18:47,694
I know! We'll take her to Grandma Tsunade!
She can save her.

1760
02:18:48,361 --> 02:18:49,446
Calm down, Naruto!

1761
02:18:52,605 --> 02:18:53,422
Hinata!

1762
02:19:02,047 --> 02:19:02,762
Sakura...!

1763
02:19:04,056 --> 02:19:05,432
Don't worry! She's alive.

1764
02:19:05,975 --> 02:19:07,726
- Are you sure?
- What a relief!

1765
02:19:08,209 --> 02:19:10,753
Wow, that scared me...

1766
02:19:11,021 --> 02:19:13,983
Idiot! How can you be so distracted
by a mere fly?!

1767
02:19:14,393 --> 02:19:15,118
Wha--?

1768
02:19:16,034 --> 02:19:17,035
What's the matter, Shino?

1769
02:19:18,370 --> 02:19:20,956
I was thinking about
my Parasitic Insects...

1770
02:19:22,126 --> 02:19:24,337
After it was defeated by
the Crystal Style Jutsu,

1771
02:19:24,472 --> 02:19:26,390
the insect shattered in my hand.

1772
02:19:27,944 --> 02:19:29,863
And yet, Hinata survived...

1773
02:19:30,320 --> 02:19:36,451
True. When we first encountered
the Crystal Style, it shattered.

1774
02:19:39,080 --> 02:19:43,001
I wonder what the insect that survived
and Hinata have in common?

1775
02:19:44,722 --> 02:19:45,723
I...

1776
02:19:45,856 --> 02:19:47,858
Oh, don't move so soon.

1777
02:19:48,880 --> 02:19:51,591
When I received the jutsu...

1778
02:19:51,616 --> 02:19:55,036
I released my chakra from
my chakra points all at once,

1779
02:19:55,061 --> 02:19:58,189
to create a thin film to cover myself with.

1780
02:20:01,228 --> 02:20:07,234
I see. That's why, even her Crystal Style
failed to crystallize chakra.

1781
02:20:07,753 --> 02:20:11,590
Although you faced the unexpected,
you did a great job, Hinata.

1782
02:20:12,375 --> 02:20:13,085
Right...

1783
02:20:13,788 --> 02:20:17,083
Only a Hyuga family member could
pull that off. Hinata, you're awesome!

1784
02:20:18,683 --> 02:20:20,601
I'm glad you're okay.

1785
02:20:21,425 --> 02:20:24,720
Sorry you had to worry about me, Naruto...

1786
02:20:25,500 --> 02:20:28,628
You don't need to apologize.

1787
02:20:29,011 --> 02:20:30,178
Naruto...

1788
02:20:32,316 --> 02:20:35,611
Well, Senpai, what are we going to do now?

1789
02:20:36,254 --> 02:20:38,006
Well... Let's see...

1790
02:20:40,109 --> 02:20:42,732
I-I'm all right.

1791
02:20:42,938 --> 02:20:44,398
Don't force yourself just yet.

1792
02:20:44,852 --> 02:20:48,105
I think we were lucky because Hinata
was the only victim of the Crystal Style...

1793
02:20:48,523 --> 02:20:51,276
We don't have any countermeasures
against the Crystal Style at this point,

1794
02:20:51,301 --> 02:20:53,428
so retreating is the best option for now.

1795
02:20:53,820 --> 02:20:56,448
But then, they'll get away!

1796
02:20:56,635 --> 02:21:01,264
Right. Unless we stay on the look out,
we'll lose them.

1797
02:21:01,536 --> 02:21:05,039
It was so much trouble finding them.

1798
02:21:05,482 --> 02:21:09,153
I'm afraid that if we let them go now,
we'll never find them again...

1799
02:21:09,785 --> 02:21:10,786
Then here's the plan.

1800
02:21:11,334 --> 02:21:14,003
We have enough members,
so let's split into two groups.

1801
02:21:14,583 --> 02:21:18,086
Sai and Sakura, you two stand by here
to wait for Hinata's recovery.

1802
02:21:18,482 --> 02:21:19,245
- Right!
- Right!

1803
02:21:19,486 --> 02:21:21,112
The others will track them.

1804
02:21:22,354 --> 02:21:25,482
But as they move,
they're erasing their scent.

1805
02:21:26,019 --> 02:21:28,021
It's impossible to track them,
even for Akamaru.

1806
02:21:28,176 --> 02:21:30,011
It looks like they're extremely cautious.

1807
02:21:30,520 --> 02:21:34,232
Then how can we find someone
that seems so impossible to track?

1808
02:21:35,093 --> 02:21:37,929
We can use their monitoring bats.

1809
02:21:38,580 --> 02:21:42,959
However, if we get too close to a bat,
they'll find us first.

1810
02:21:43,337 --> 02:21:45,756
So we should be very careful
from this point on.

1811
02:21:46,035 --> 02:21:47,036
I see...

1812
02:21:47,334 --> 02:21:50,004
It's a pain, but we don't have a choice...

1813
02:21:50,176 --> 02:21:51,344
I have something to add.

1814
02:21:51,557 --> 02:21:55,227
We also should be careful about the Crystal
Style barrier which Naruto just broke.

1815
02:21:56,578 --> 02:22:04,335
Even if you find them, don't attack.
After all, our goal is to investigate them.

1816
02:22:04,786 --> 02:22:05,829
- Understood!
- Understood!

1817
02:22:06,486 --> 02:22:08,946
Then we're going home.

1818
02:22:09,687 --> 02:22:11,773
We'll see you the next time
we need your help.

1819
02:22:12,072 --> 02:22:14,699
I'm going home too, Kakashi.

1820
02:22:15,203 --> 02:22:17,497
Good work today, Pakkun.

1821
02:22:19,155 --> 02:22:22,116
- See you!
- Good bye!

1822
02:22:23,866 --> 02:22:25,826
Then let's go, everyone!

1823
02:22:43,890 --> 02:22:44,891
Guren!

1824
02:22:45,807 --> 02:22:48,101
Is everything all right?

1825
02:22:48,601 --> 02:22:50,270
I ran into someone I know.

1826
02:22:50,603 --> 02:22:51,271
What?

1827
02:22:51,604 --> 02:22:52,689
Who was that?

1828
02:22:53,012 --> 02:22:54,221
The man with the headband.

1829
02:22:54,732 --> 02:22:55,733
Headband?

1830
02:22:56,276 --> 02:22:58,194
Could it be the guy we just met?

1831
02:22:58,528 --> 02:23:01,406
How do you know about him?

1832
02:23:01,867 --> 02:23:03,869
Well... That's right!

1833
02:23:04,075 --> 02:23:06,786
When I went out with Kabuto the other day,
I met him.

1834
02:23:07,096 --> 02:23:09,849
The man said he has a place to return to.

1835
02:23:10,464 --> 02:23:15,385
And he asked me to return with him,
but I didn't.

1836
02:23:16,047 --> 02:23:19,634
Because I thought that was not
the kind of place where I could return to.

1837
02:23:20,086 --> 02:23:21,170
Was that just coincidence?

1838
02:23:21,301 --> 02:23:26,681
I think so. Because there's no way
they saw us and this kid together.

1839
02:23:27,588 --> 02:23:29,548
Well, what should we do, Guren?

1840
02:23:29,913 --> 02:23:31,039
There can only be one answer.

1841
02:23:32,353 --> 02:23:34,564
Good boy, thanks for coming back.

1842
02:23:34,939 --> 02:23:39,402
You're not returning to them.
You're returning to me.

1843
02:23:39,944 --> 02:23:40,778
Yeah.

1844
02:23:40,903 --> 02:23:44,824
But if he's your friend,
I want to say hello to him.

1845
02:23:45,603 --> 02:23:47,272
Where did you see him?

1846
02:23:47,702 --> 02:23:49,329
Are you going to track them?

1847
02:23:49,576 --> 02:23:50,347
Yes.

1848
02:23:51,039 --> 02:23:53,333
Once I decide to go after something,
I stick with it.

1849
02:23:53,467 --> 02:23:55,386
That's the way I do things.

1850
02:23:55,710 --> 02:23:58,171
Guren, that's a bad habit.

1851
02:23:59,411 --> 02:24:00,412
Kabuto!

1852
02:24:00,840 --> 02:24:04,427
- It's easy for you to go overboard.
- What?!

1853
02:24:05,039 --> 02:24:07,353
I trust you've learned your lesson.

1854
02:24:07,805 --> 02:24:09,265
Based on the story I just heard,

1855
02:24:09,307 --> 02:24:12,435
I think you were very lucky that
they didn't take Yuukimaru away.

1856
02:24:13,006 --> 02:24:16,050
If you lose Yuukimaru...

1857
02:24:17,106 --> 02:24:21,194
Guren, you'll lose credibility
with Lord Orochimaru.

1858
02:24:26,161 --> 02:24:31,023
Damn it! We shouldn't have taken
our eyes off them, even for a moment!

1859
02:24:31,584 --> 02:24:34,545
We have to start tracking them
all over again!

1860
02:24:34,791 --> 02:24:38,378
Because of the bats,
we can't move freely!

1861
02:24:38,920 --> 02:24:42,090
We have no choice.
Shall we try it the risky way?

1862
02:24:45,892 --> 02:24:47,852
Shino, do you have an idea?

1863
02:24:48,763 --> 02:24:50,223
Let's change our way of thinking.

1864
02:24:50,807 --> 02:24:54,602
Not wanting the bats to find us
is a problem.

1865
02:24:55,269 --> 02:24:59,065
But if we assume the bats will find us,
we can take advantage of them.

1866
02:24:59,857 --> 02:25:02,360
Huh? What does that mean?

1867
02:25:02,819 --> 02:25:05,488
The supersonic waves of the bats
won't work far away.

1868
02:25:06,155 --> 02:25:12,120
When the bats sense our presence,
how do they report it to the enemy?

1869
02:25:12,495 --> 02:25:14,622
Oh, I get it now!

1870
02:25:14,997 --> 02:25:16,916
Now that you mention it, you're right.

1871
02:25:17,375 --> 02:25:19,043
Good work figuring it out, Shino.

1872
02:25:19,502 --> 02:25:23,047
H-Hold on!
Does everyone understand?

1873
02:25:23,297 --> 02:25:28,386
Who doesn't understand?
We're all chunin and jonin.

1874
02:25:28,720 --> 02:25:31,222
Oops! There's one genin.

1875
02:25:31,993 --> 02:25:37,978
You, are you trying to pick a fight?!
Fine! I understand, too!

1876
02:25:38,229 --> 02:25:39,814
Really?

1877
02:25:40,398 --> 02:25:41,983
Let's get back to what
we were talking about.

1878
02:25:42,024 --> 02:25:43,443
So, what should we do?

1879
02:25:43,901 --> 02:25:44,902
Let's try it!

1880
02:25:45,278 --> 02:25:48,030
Naruto, make three Shadow Clones,

1881
02:25:48,030 --> 02:25:50,450
line them up ten meters away
from each other

1882
02:25:50,491 --> 02:25:51,951
and have them run around the grounds!

1883
02:25:51,976 --> 02:25:53,478
But if I do that...

1884
02:25:53,503 --> 02:25:54,504
Hurry up!

1885
02:25:54,980 --> 02:25:56,773
I know!

1886
02:25:58,412 --> 02:25:59,789
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

1887
02:26:03,573 --> 02:26:07,119
But won't the bats' radar detect us
if I do this?!

1888
02:26:07,729 --> 02:26:09,523
- That's what we want!
- What?

1889
02:26:15,537 --> 02:26:17,664
I found them! That must be it!

1890
02:26:18,164 --> 02:26:20,667
Because there's no reason
for the bats to be flying around

1891
02:26:20,823 --> 02:26:22,449
during the daytime without
a good reason.

1892
02:26:22,607 --> 02:26:24,192
All right! Let's go, everyone!

1893
02:26:25,026 --> 02:26:28,237
By the way,
why are we following the bats?

1894
02:26:28,362 --> 02:26:32,033
Duh! See, you don't understand, do you?!

1895
02:26:32,617 --> 02:26:37,830
Those bats will return to their hideout
to let them know they've found us!

1896
02:26:38,132 --> 02:26:38,864
Um...?

1897
02:26:39,043 --> 02:26:42,922
That means, if we follow them,
we'll find where the enemy is hiding.

1898
02:26:43,419 --> 02:26:45,296
Oh, I get it!

1899
02:26:45,794 --> 02:26:49,214
Good grief! You're really slow.

1900
02:26:49,467 --> 02:26:54,096
Humph! Don't act all high and might
just because you're a chunin!

1901
02:26:54,612 --> 02:26:55,655
Take this!

1902
02:27:00,770 --> 02:27:03,086
That stinks!

1903
02:27:03,342 --> 02:27:05,553
Heh, heh! Look at yourself!

1904
02:27:09,529 --> 02:27:11,781
Sorry, but you guys must stay here

1905
02:27:11,806 --> 02:27:13,724
and watch out for the guys
from the Hidden Leaf.

1906
02:27:14,242 --> 02:27:17,453
We don't want any distractions.

1907
02:27:17,537 --> 02:27:19,914
What?! We can't come with you?!

1908
02:27:20,248 --> 02:27:23,417
Rinji, this time
just do what Kabuto says!

1909
02:27:25,044 --> 02:27:28,256
All right. If you say so, Guren...

1910
02:27:28,631 --> 02:27:29,632
Sorry...

1911
02:27:30,591 --> 02:27:31,634
Let's go.

1912
02:27:39,642 --> 02:27:43,729
From now on,
the fewer people, the better.

1913
02:27:44,295 --> 02:27:47,006
Is there something that
you don't want us to see?

1914
02:27:47,567 --> 02:27:50,570
Well, there's something
you don't see very often.

1915
02:27:51,445 --> 02:27:52,780
Just wait until you see it.

1916
02:27:57,837 --> 02:27:58,838
What's the matter?

1917
02:27:59,078 --> 02:28:02,623
Kabuto... I have a bad feeling...

1918
02:28:03,085 --> 02:28:06,088
When I took the medicine,
my head really hurt.

1919
02:28:06,614 --> 02:28:09,450
Don't worry. Nothing will go wrong.

1920
02:28:10,172 --> 02:28:12,717
When something happens,
Guren will protect you.

1921
02:28:14,552 --> 02:28:18,347
- Really?
- Y-Yeah. That's true.

1922
02:28:24,186 --> 02:28:26,439
<i>Every time I come to this place,
I feel really weird...</i>

1923
02:28:27,398 --> 02:28:29,191
What are you going to do here?

1924
02:28:29,942 --> 02:28:32,361
Well... I'll perform a little test.

1925
02:28:33,664 --> 02:28:36,292
With him and... Guren.

1926
02:28:39,375 --> 02:28:40,960
Here, put this on.

1927
02:28:57,323 --> 02:28:59,033
If you give him that much medicine...!

1928
02:28:59,602 --> 02:29:00,336
Huh?

1929
02:29:00,809 --> 02:29:03,687
Are you trying to disrupt
Lord Orochimaru's plan?

1930
02:29:06,239 --> 02:29:10,535
Don't worry. Let's start something fun.

1931
02:29:12,763 --> 02:29:14,682
This medicine is different from
what you took before.

1932
02:29:15,154 --> 02:29:16,989
This medicine won't bring you
any suffering.

1933
02:29:17,982 --> 02:29:20,652
You can't go back until you take this.

1934
02:29:31,248 --> 02:29:33,083
Guren, it's your turn.

1935
02:29:33,484 --> 02:29:35,111
Stop being so bossy all the time!

1936
02:29:38,161 --> 02:29:40,747
<i>Crystal Style:
Jade Crystal Hexagonal Column!</i>

1937
02:29:51,461 --> 02:29:52,265
Oh!

1938
02:30:13,013 --> 02:30:15,474
<i>What? What is going to happen?</i>

1939
02:30:46,832 --> 02:30:48,000
<i>What is this...?</i>

1940
02:30:48,622 --> 02:30:50,458
Be careful! It's coming!

1941
02:30:50,708 --> 02:30:51,709
It's coming?

1942
02:31:09,430 --> 02:31:11,056
The test was successful!

1943
02:31:11,838 --> 02:31:12,922
It'll appear!

1944
02:31:12,980 --> 02:31:14,523
What will appear?!

1945
02:31:15,075 --> 02:31:16,160
A Tailed Beast.

1946
02:31:16,567 --> 02:31:17,568
Tailed Beast...?

1947
02:31:26,452 --> 02:31:27,953
This is the Three-Tailed Beast.
