1
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:15,598
What happened here anyway?

2
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:19,436
What kind of battle would cause this?

3
00:00:21,023 --> 00:00:23,275
<i>Two Sharingan users...</i>

4
00:00:23,475 --> 00:00:27,395
<i>Is the battle between the Uchiha Clan...
this intense?</i>

5
00:00:28,207 --> 00:00:29,208
Where's Sasuke?

6
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:37,704
I don't detect any other chakra
besides ours in this area.

7
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:42,923
There's still a faint smell left, but...

8
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,624
We were too late...

9
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:49,090
Naruto...

10
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,927
Why?

11
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:02,270
Why is it that I can never
reach Sasuke?

12
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:10,403
Kakashi-senpai...

13
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,410
If there is even a faint scent

14
00:01:19,435 --> 00:01:21,979
that lingers from Sasuke...

15
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:24,459
Yeah... that's right.

16
00:01:24,912 --> 00:01:27,039
No way can we give up
after coming this far.

17
00:01:29,564 --> 00:01:31,065
We'll see this through until the end.

18
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,427
Until there's absolutely
no trace of Sasuke's scent.

19
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,200
<i>Byakugan!</i>

20
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,121
<i>Nothing... Please, find him.</i>

21
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:02,914
<i>Sasuke...</i>

22
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,789
Yeah... I know.

23
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,359
There's no trace of Sasuke's scent.

24
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:36,990
Damn it...

25
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,327
<i>Where did you go?</i>

26
00:02:51,784 --> 00:02:53,536
We've done what we could...

27
00:02:54,604 --> 00:02:56,773
Let's go back to the Hidden Leaf...

28
00:02:58,339 --> 00:02:59,340
Sasuke...

29
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,266
That seat is reserved for me...

30
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:11,877
Lord Utakata!

31
00:05:12,762 --> 00:05:14,847
Tonbei is looking for you.

32
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,573
I'm counting on you.

33
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,187
<i>Not again.</i>

34
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,435
They sure went through
a lot of trouble

35
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,402
setting up so many traps in
such an open field.

36
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:50,016
Someone is breaking through our traps
and approaching our fort.

37
00:05:50,926 --> 00:05:53,425
Just in case, in accordance with
the late master's instructions,

38
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,745
I have alerted the Hidden Leaf.

39
00:05:58,643 --> 00:06:02,814
It's impossible for any ordinary person
to get close to our fort.

40
00:06:03,505 --> 00:06:06,716
However, if the enemy does succeed
in getting here...

41
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:10,244
The three of us, including Lord Utakata,
just have to fight together!

42
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:11,754
We'll turn the tables on them!

43
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:16,876
Why are they targeting us?
What is their purpose?

44
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,087
Most likely...

45
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:22,840
the Forbidden Jutsu that has been
passed down to our clan.

46
00:06:24,738 --> 00:06:28,951
All these traps, then as you near
the fort, there's a deep ravine...

47
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,511
On top of which is
a barrier beyond that.

48
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:35,091
Talk about being overly cautious.

49
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:38,981
Don't you think so, Nango?

50
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:42,740
Yeah...

51
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,323
You're just not a man of many words...
are you?

52
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,993
Chushin, enough of your rambling.

53
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:55,665
A loose tongue is a sign of
an empty head.

54
00:06:56,124 --> 00:07:00,378
I'd say you're the one who looks bad
each time you open your mouth.

55
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,712
Benten...

56
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:09,011
Going through the extremes to
protect something is proof of its value!

57
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,556
Get into your positions.

58
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:25,049
That must be it...

59
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:37,253
What?! The barrier has been broken.

60
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,877
These guys... are not ordinary people.

61
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,129
Benten!

62
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,338
Leave them to me!

63
00:07:58,984 --> 00:08:01,111
Next is mountain climbing.

64
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:05,026
Lady Hotaru, take this...

65
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:09,280
In order to protect the Forbidden Jutsu
that your grandfather passed down,

66
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:14,260
you and Lord Utakata must escape
to our hidden village.

67
00:08:14,838 --> 00:08:15,813
What about you?

68
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:20,291
I will follow immediately.
Now you must hurry...

69
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,294
No! If we're to escape,
the three of us will go together.

70
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,214
The enemy is at our doorstep.

71
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:29,300
This is not the time for
self-indulgence.

72
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:34,847
You're not coming?

73
00:08:37,841 --> 00:08:39,843
Go, Lady Hotaru.

74
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,755
Lord Utakata!

75
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:54,116
Please... take care of Lady Hotaru.

76
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,411
The debt I owe you will be repaid...

77
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,967
Phew, that was close.

78
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:15,054
This isn't going to be
an ordinary climb, Akaboshi.

79
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:20,268
I can't wait to see what's waiting
for us at the summit.

80
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:22,895
Lady Hotaru...

81
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,606
Please be extremely careful
while traveling.

82
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,694
You must not leave Lord Utakata's side.

83
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:34,615
Tonbei, you must follow us later.
Promise me that!

84
00:09:34,726 --> 00:09:38,688
Lady Hotaru, think only of
your own safety. Nothing else!

85
00:09:45,142 --> 00:09:49,201
<i>Lord En no Gyoja... I promise to buy
as much time as possible...</i>

86
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,804
<i>So I can protect Lady Hotaru!</i>

87
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,058
Lady Tsunade, we received this...

88
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:09,692
What?!

89
00:10:24,854 --> 00:10:25,938
Lady Katsuyu!

90
00:10:26,099 --> 00:10:28,143
Oh, Kakashi...

91
00:10:28,672 --> 00:10:32,133
What? Lady Katsuyu came
all the way to greet us?

92
00:10:32,669 --> 00:10:34,296
No, she didn't.

93
00:10:36,563 --> 00:10:39,107
There must be trouble.

94
00:10:41,068 --> 00:10:42,099
Because...

95
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:48,898
Lady Tsunade only uses
Lady Katsuyu during emergencies.

96
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:52,026
I get it! So there's an urgent situation.

97
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,987
<i>I know how you feel, Shino...</i>

98
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:58,032
<i>When you aren't allowed to finish
what you wanted to say...</i>

99
00:10:58,415 --> 00:11:00,501
A secret treaty?

100
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,539
During the Third Great Ninja War,
a certain jutsu passed down

101
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,084
by En no Gyoja, the leader
of the Tsuchigumo Clan,

102
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,336
wiped out an entire village.

103
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,732
The Third Hokage demanded that
such a dangerous jutsu

104
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:35,152
be classified as a Forbidden Jutsu.

105
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:40,491
And in exchange, it was agreed that
the Hidden Leaf would provide aid

106
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,327
to the Tsuchigumo clan
in time of danger.

107
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:49,333
Kakashi, you are to report to the village
for details from your last mission.

108
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,168
Understood.

109
00:11:52,275 --> 00:11:53,776
We're battling against time.

110
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,507
Team 7 will go with Captain Yamato

111
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,384
and head for
Mount Katsuragi immediately.

112
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,385
Yes, sir!

113
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:02,096
Why aren't you coming,
Kakashi-sensei?

114
00:12:02,996 --> 00:12:04,790
Is it a problem if it's just me?

115
00:12:05,001 --> 00:12:07,379
That's not what I meant...

116
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:13,566
En no Gyoja passed away a year ago
and the fort on Mount Katsuragi

117
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:17,620
is occupied by his granddaughter,
Hotaru, and her servant.

118
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:21,128
Whoever is attacking the fort
is undoubtedly

119
00:12:21,153 --> 00:12:23,573
after En no Gyoja's Forbidden Jutsu.

120
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,336
We must prevent the theft of
the Forbidden Jutsu at all costs.

121
00:12:29,098 --> 00:12:30,975
Why did you send Naruto too?

122
00:12:31,547 --> 00:12:35,884
It's a countermeasure against
the Akatsuki.

123
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:01,393
Did this old man intend to
protect the fort all by himself?

124
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,066
Still, this took longer than planned.

125
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,104
Let's hurry and start the search.

126
00:13:12,003 --> 00:13:15,002
That's the Tsuchigumo clan's fort?!

127
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:18,839
Captain Yamato!

128
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:19,865
Hm?

129
00:13:25,798 --> 00:13:27,675
What happened here?

130
00:13:27,862 --> 00:13:29,780
It doesn't look like
this is from a fight...

131
00:13:30,108 --> 00:13:31,526
Sai, how about it?

132
00:13:31,871 --> 00:13:35,458
There are fresh footprints headed
towards the fort...

133
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:37,702
The enemy is a group of four.

134
00:13:38,283 --> 00:13:40,661
These are from traps surrounding
the fort.

135
00:13:41,211 --> 00:13:43,339
It looks like the enemy avoided them.

136
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,950
Then there are more in this area?

137
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:49,578
We'll just follow the trail of trap marks.

138
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:50,746
I get it!

139
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:54,416
That way, we'll get to the fort
without encountering any fresh traps!

140
00:13:55,578 --> 00:13:58,497
Where is the Forbidden Jutsu
of En no Gyoja?!

141
00:14:04,848 --> 00:14:08,143
You lost, so 'fess up.

142
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,307
I know nothing.

143
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,810
Playing dumb is useless!

144
00:14:13,538 --> 00:14:14,874
The granddaughter.

145
00:14:16,391 --> 00:14:20,812
That's right. En no Gyoja
has a granddaughter.

146
00:14:23,069 --> 00:14:24,821
Did you let her escape?

147
00:14:24,986 --> 00:14:26,862
She has the Forbidden Jutsu?

148
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,076
Is that it? Hey!

149
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:32,329
Enough. I know where to find her.

150
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:39,378
We're out of time.
It seems we have some interference.

151
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,924
It's a dead-end, Captain Yamato.

152
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:46,493
We'll just lay a bridge across it.

153
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,654
<i>Wood Style!</i>

154
00:14:53,064 --> 00:14:55,024
Have to hand it to you, Captain Yamato!

155
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,814
Aren't you glad I was here?

156
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,943
Don't rub it in.

157
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:14,098
Hang on, old man!

158
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,875
It's weak, but he still has a pulse.
He'll live.

159
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,085
We were one step too late...

160
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:24,423
Sai, check the area to see
if there are any others.

161
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:25,413
Right.

162
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,891
You've come to...

163
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,810
We are from the Hidden Leaf

164
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,021
and were dispatched to
provide assistance.

165
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,900
You are Lady Hotaru's servant,
I presume?

166
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,697
I am... Tonbei...

167
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:13,222
L-Lady Hotaru is headed for the
hidden village of the Tsuchigumo clan.

168
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,934
There is an escape route with
a collapsed entry

169
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,477
in the back of the mansion.

170
00:16:19,753 --> 00:16:22,715
Lady Hotaru went... through there...

171
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,985
I understand. We will follow her.

172
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:30,155
Sakura, stay here and tend
to Tonbei's injuries.

173
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,187
Right.

174
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,078
Naruto, Sai, let's go.

175
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:11,155
Lord Utakata, there's something
I'd like to ask you...

176
00:17:13,957 --> 00:17:18,420
Will you teach me jutsu even
after we get to the hidden village?

177
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,183
I don't recall teaching you anything.

178
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:28,347
But back at the fort,
you trained me in many things.

179
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,759
You did that on your own...

180
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,702
Also, when we reach the village,
I will no longer be needed.

181
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:40,517
There's no one stronger than you
in the village!

182
00:17:40,586 --> 00:17:47,218
And I want you to teach me.
That time, when you saved me...

183
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,737
I didn't save you that time...

184
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,144
But...!

185
00:17:53,285 --> 00:17:57,623
The ninja who attacked were coming
after me, not you.

186
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,538
I just fought in order to protect myself.

187
00:18:02,216 --> 00:18:05,053
Even so, after watching you,

188
00:18:05,078 --> 00:18:09,374
I knew I wanted to be strong
like you. No, I must.

189
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:12,332
That is why I wish to learn your jutsu...

190
00:18:12,371 --> 00:18:13,831
Being strong is enough for you?

191
00:18:14,609 --> 00:18:15,266
Huh?

192
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:24,019
You might regret being taught
by a wanted man.

193
00:18:24,641 --> 00:18:26,769
I trust you, Lord Utakata.

194
00:18:27,244 --> 00:18:30,872
No matter what happens,
I will always consider you my master.

195
00:18:31,585 --> 00:18:33,420
Don't call me your master!

196
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:36,290
<i>Crap!</i>

197
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,150
Step away from that girl!

198
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,200
<i>A Shadow Clone?</i>

199
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:54,772
<i>What a bother...</i>

200
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,399
Give it up and be captured--!

201
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,441
No!

202
00:19:11,494 --> 00:19:13,705
He is not an enemy!

203
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:15,801
Naruto!

204
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,705
Pardon him for jumping to conclusions.

205
00:19:25,388 --> 00:19:29,059
Tonbei had told us only
about Lady Hotaru...

206
00:19:29,496 --> 00:19:31,456
Tonbei is alive and well?

207
00:19:32,048 --> 00:19:35,634
Yes. He's under the care
of our medic.

208
00:19:37,264 --> 00:19:38,307
I'm glad...

209
00:19:38,864 --> 00:19:41,741
From here on, you have
our protection as well.

210
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,624
Hey, I'm really sorry.

211
00:19:49,237 --> 00:19:52,031
I can leave the rest to you then...

212
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,752
Huh?

213
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,111
Sure thing!
I always fulfill my missions...

214
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:56,862
Huh?

215
00:19:57,604 --> 00:19:59,731
Thanks... Take care.

216
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:01,617
Lord Utakata!

217
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,495
Hey, where are you going?

218
00:20:08,464 --> 00:20:11,968
Can't you at least stay with me until
we reach the hidden village?

219
00:20:12,913 --> 00:20:16,375
Those guys are strong...
You can rely on them.

220
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:21,033
I don't need guards!
I need someone to teach me jutsu!

221
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,265
Come with me, please...

222
00:20:32,767 --> 00:20:35,353
I'll be more serious than ever
in my training!

223
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:40,405
I'll endure anything and
I promise never to cry! And...

224
00:20:40,613 --> 00:20:46,350
And I'll never call you
my master... ever... again...

225
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,667
Stupid Master Utakata!

226
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,139
I told you not to call me that...

227
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,842
I'm not foolish enough to
be called master.

228
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:24,449
So... the girl has bodyguards now...

229
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:28,787
I never imagined the Hidden Leaf's
bodyguards would reach her so quickly.

230
00:21:29,035 --> 00:21:31,039
But even so,
there are only four of them.

231
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:35,210
I say we get rid of them all and take
the Forbidden Jutsu from the girl, Boss.

232
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,254
Don't be so impatient.

233
00:21:37,487 --> 00:21:39,155
Then, what's the plan?

234
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:43,176
That Forbidden Jutsu is worth
more than money to us.

235
00:21:43,518 --> 00:21:45,145
We can't afford to fail.

236
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:49,972
That jutsu displayed unbelievable power
during the last great war.

237
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:54,813
If we steal it, all of us could
go from a motley band of thieves

238
00:21:54,999 --> 00:21:57,918
to lords of our own domains.

239
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,026
But...

240
00:21:59,407 --> 00:22:01,033
The Hidden Leaf people...

241
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,613
Could the Forbidden Jutsu
have fallen into their hands?

242
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:04,990
Very unlikely.

243
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,778
The previous Hokage and En no Gyoja
forged a secret treaty

244
00:22:08,803 --> 00:22:11,700
to protect the Forbidden Jutsu
at all cost.

245
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,250
The Hidden Leaf is
only fulfilling that promise.

246
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:19,421
But... if they're the vanguards
of that treaty,

247
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,786
then those bodyguards
must be skilled fighters.

248
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:26,219
Yeah... and reinforcements
are sure to come!

249
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,555
Nango! Benten!

250
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,345
Have you guys lost your nerve
before the fight even begins?!

251
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,518
Seems it's not just your face,

252
00:22:33,543 --> 00:22:35,607
but your head's bad, too.

253
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,301
What'd you say?!

254
00:22:37,326 --> 00:22:41,121
Consider all the possibilities and
use what you've got up here.

255
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,986
Stop fighting amongst yourselves.

256
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,655
Have you forgotten? We're a team.

257
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,366
We can't afford to lose even one of us.

258
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,810
And it's our unity and
combination jutsu

259
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:53,080
that helped us live through
chaotic times.

260
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:55,165
Yeah, fine...

261
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,209
There's no need to rush.

262
00:22:57,628 --> 00:22:59,848
I already know what
their destination is.

263
00:22:59,873 --> 00:23:02,292
They're headed for the Hidden Village
of the Tsuchigumo Clan.

264
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,258
The Hidden Leaf will leave
on their own

265
00:23:05,355 --> 00:23:07,262
once they arrive at the destination.

266
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:10,722
But won't it be a problem if they
manage to enter the hidden village?

267
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:15,727
Akaboshi. Seems you still
don't understand humans.

268
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:19,231
To us, that Forbidden Jutsu
is a treasure,

269
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:23,235
but to normal people,
it's nothing but a nuisance.

270
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,595
What'd you do that for?!

271
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,514
That's what I want to ask you!

272
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:54,558
Why are you following me?!

273
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,978
Why? I'm your bodyguard,
that's why!

274
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:01,273
I'll say it again.
I don't need a bodyguard.

275
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,341
I can protect myself just fine.

276
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,820
You Hidden Leaf people
may leave now!

277
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:11,992
We can't just say,
"Oh, is that so?" and leave.

278
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:15,662
Why not?!
Really, please don't bother with me.

279
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,415
We're not bothering you,
we're just guarding!

280
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,961
Naruto, let's do as she says
and leave.

281
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,005
How come?!

282
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,548
We have no choice.

283
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,091
W-Wait here for a sec.

284
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:32,554
Are you sure?
The enemy could still be close by.

285
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,763
Now, now, don't worry.

286
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:37,893
Hey!

287
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,022
I get it. Well then, we'll be leaving.

288
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,398
Fine.

289
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:53,575
No!

290
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:56,995
No! Get it off! Get it off of me!

291
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,249
There.

292
00:25:02,664 --> 00:25:05,375
Wh-What was that thing?

293
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,653
A mountain leech.
There are a lot of them around here,

294
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,759
so it's not unusual for them
to rain down on you.

295
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:12,883
Rain down?

296
00:25:12,908 --> 00:25:15,953
Yeah. See you!
Be careful on your way.

297
00:25:16,094 --> 00:25:17,971
All by... yourself!

298
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,061
What'd you step on it for?

299
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,855
Naruto, please stay by me...

300
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,816
I can't touch something like that.
I just can't.

301
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,361
Absolutely impossible.

302
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:33,240
If leeches rain down on me,
I want you to block them, Naruto.

303
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,075
But you said you didn't need
a bodyguard.

304
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,249
Just until we get out of this forest!

305
00:25:37,274 --> 00:25:39,858
Hmm... What should I do?

306
00:25:40,076 --> 00:25:42,329
Please, Naruto!

307
00:25:43,372 --> 00:25:44,813
I suppose I could...

308
00:25:51,229 --> 00:25:53,148
But now that I think about it,

309
00:25:53,256 --> 00:25:55,550
Lord Utakata would still be
my bodyguard

310
00:25:55,575 --> 00:25:59,037
if you all hadn't shown up.

311
00:25:59,293 --> 00:26:02,963
Utakata... The guy who uses
that weird jutsu?

312
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:10,026
He is my master. I want to become
strong like Lord Utakata.

313
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:13,572
Hmm... Your master, eh?

314
00:26:13,896 --> 00:26:16,816
There's no such thing as
a good master.

315
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,593
Take my master, for example...

316
00:26:23,678 --> 00:26:26,543
He's a perv and totally irresponsible...

317
00:26:27,772 --> 00:26:29,816
And on top of that,
he gets carried away a lot.

318
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:36,303
But well... as a ninja,
he's very strong, dependable,

319
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,763
and above all, kind.

320
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:42,892
Guess you can't judge a person
by their appearance.

321
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:44,043
If I could,

322
00:26:44,068 --> 00:26:47,154
I wouldn't mind becoming
a ninja like him some day.

323
00:26:49,602 --> 00:26:52,873
You like your master, too,
don't you, Naruto?

324
00:26:53,024 --> 00:26:55,944
Like him? Who could like
an old pervert like him?

325
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,191
I, too, want to be strong
like Lord Utakata.

326
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,494
If I become strong,

327
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:04,497
I can master the jutsu
Grandfather left to me.

328
00:27:05,253 --> 00:27:06,587
If I do that...

329
00:27:06,949 --> 00:27:10,129
I could even restore
the Tsuchigumo Clan.

330
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:14,841
For someone so young, it looks like you're
carrying some heavy responsibilities.

331
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:19,220
By the way, where could
your master have gone off to?

332
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:20,597
I don't know.

333
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:23,391
For some reason,
when I call Lord Utakata "master,"

334
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,018
he gets very upset.

335
00:27:25,357 --> 00:27:27,734
<i>Sai! What's with the numbers?!</i>

336
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,319
You can stop with the leeches now.

337
00:27:34,939 --> 00:27:38,651
Hmm... Does he mean
he wants bigger ones?

338
00:27:48,652 --> 00:27:52,114
Huh? No? Then...

339
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:55,431
For crying out loud.
Enough is enough...

340
00:27:56,377 --> 00:27:57,080
Huh?!

341
00:28:00,336 --> 00:28:02,672
What are you doing, you idiot Sai!

342
00:28:02,825 --> 00:28:04,285
Read the mood, will ya?!

343
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,436
Come on, you guys...

344
00:28:12,465 --> 00:28:15,552
Now I can go back to
my drifting lifestyle...

345
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,908
She should be okay
if she's with him.

346
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:41,506
<i>Persistent guys...</i>

347
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:06,119
<i>What is... that jutsu?
It's amazing!</i>

348
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,084
<i>Now they know my location...</i>

349
00:29:13,607 --> 00:29:16,484
<i>For the time being,
I must stay out of view as I move.</i>

350
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,131
Are you all right?!

351
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,760
That wound...

352
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:26,181
Allow me to treat it back at our fort.

353
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,726
That's the least I can do
for coming to my aid.

354
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:31,772
<i>Fort?</i>

355
00:29:39,585 --> 00:29:41,295
Please hang on!

356
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:44,908
I'm going to get help.
Don't move from this spot!

357
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:49,037
- <i>Damn! I used too much chakra.</i>
- I'll be right back...

358
00:30:07,627 --> 00:30:09,574
You need to be treated immediately.

359
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,725
Come to our fort...

360
00:30:31,551 --> 00:30:33,803
Looks like no one's coming after me...

361
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:38,338
My wounds have also healed...
Guess it's time to...

362
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,421
Please take me as your student!

363
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:46,723
After seeing your fight the other day, I
have nothing but respect for you, master!

364
00:30:47,706 --> 00:30:48,707
Master?

365
00:30:48,771 --> 00:30:50,606
Yes, Master Utakata!

366
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:57,105
Don't ever call me that again...

367
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:59,440
Huh? But...

368
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,943
Don't you ever call me master again!

369
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,497
I have no intention of taking
a student.

370
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:17,750
Lord... Utakata...

371
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:24,966
But that would be forgetting your
debt to me for accepting my hospitality.

372
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:30,471
Is it right to eat free meals
and drink free sake?!

373
00:31:30,496 --> 00:31:34,500
So, what would you like
on today's menu of free food?!

374
00:31:36,737 --> 00:31:40,023
You sure hit where it hurts.

375
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,317
Tonbei taught me to say

376
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:44,861
that if you refused to take me
as your student...

377
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:47,315
So that old man was in
on this, too, eh?

378
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:50,578
Look here, you haven't had
any training at all...

379
00:31:50,603 --> 00:31:51,813
If you're talking about ninjutsu,

380
00:31:51,838 --> 00:31:54,424
I have received some training
from Tonbei.

381
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,414
Then why don't you study
with the old man?

382
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,958
It wasn't enough...
That's why I'm asking you!

383
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:06,865
Okay, then,
try walking on that pond.

384
00:32:07,072 --> 00:32:10,075
On the pond... All right!

385
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:17,560
<i>Good grief.</i>

386
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,605
<i>At this rate, she won't be able
to do it before I leave.</i>

387
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:24,947
Lord Utakata! Lord Utakata!

388
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:32,700
See? Look, Lord Utakata!

389
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:37,413
You... practiced all night?

390
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:40,375
Yes. So now will you make me
your student?

391
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,336
N-No. This is just the first step...

392
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,587
Next is this jutsu.

393
00:32:44,831 --> 00:32:46,875
<i>Water Style: Raging Waves!</i>

394
00:32:52,686 --> 00:32:53,604
Amazing!

395
00:32:53,724 --> 00:32:56,561
If you can't even do this,
you can't be my student.

396
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,101
All right!

397
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,604
<i>Water Style: Raging Waves!</i>

398
00:33:04,134 --> 00:33:05,177
Huh?

399
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:06,943
<i>Water Style: Raging Waves!</i>

400
00:33:09,175 --> 00:33:10,718
Huh? Why doesn't it work?

401
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:15,159
This jutsu cannot be done unless
you possess the Water Style chakra.

402
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,828
Don't take it personally...

403
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,374
Huh? Rain?

404
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,458
Lord Utakata!

405
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:25,753
Whoa! You're too close!

406
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:26,796
Please watch this!

407
00:33:26,949 --> 00:33:28,784
<i>Water Style: Raging Waves!</i>

408
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,893
Will you make me your student now?!

409
00:33:41,148 --> 00:33:43,651
Ugh... no... I...

410
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,734
N-Not yet...

411
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:50,194
W-Wait, Lord Utakata!

412
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,492
I figured you'd be coming to
see me about now.

413
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,829
Come on, give me a break.

414
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:03,041
What's the big idea,
putting that kid up to that?

415
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,170
I have a big favor.

416
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:11,883
Would you stay here and
protect Lady Hotaru?

417
00:34:13,615 --> 00:34:16,784
That's... quite a troublesome thing
to ask in return.

418
00:34:17,332 --> 00:34:20,043
Lady Hotaru... carries a heavy destiny.

419
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,852
Judging by the way
you defeated the thieves,

420
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,563
I know you are a person
of extraordinary skills.

421
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:28,107
And above all, you lack greed.

422
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:32,487
As you can see, I am already
advanced in years.

423
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:35,948
If you take her as your student,
Lady Hotaru will be safe.

424
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:39,786
Won't you please do me this favor?

425
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,662
I'm sorry, but that won't be possible.

426
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:45,166
I'm sure you must've noticed it.
I'm being pursued.

427
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:49,962
Death gathers all around me.

428
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,673
How could you even think of leaving
that child with me?

429
00:34:54,019 --> 00:34:55,395
I see.

430
00:34:58,106 --> 00:34:59,133
And besides,

431
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:02,183
the relationship between
a master and student...

432
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,810
is not something you can count on.

433
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:12,986
<i>Master! What are you
trying to do, Master!</i>

434
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,789
<i>M-Master?!</i>

435
00:35:42,589 --> 00:35:44,633
I must've dozed off...

436
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:58,656
Do you really think we can be lords
of our own domain?

437
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,784
Damn right! Isn't that right, Akaboshi?

438
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,997
Yeah. Even if we sold it off,

439
00:36:05,213 --> 00:36:08,299
we'd still get enough money to live
the rest of our lives in leisure!

440
00:36:10,289 --> 00:36:11,242
Hey, what's wrong?

441
00:36:13,428 --> 00:36:15,698
Be on guard!
There's someone nearby.

442
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:18,228
There!

443
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:21,095
What the--?!

444
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:22,805
There!

445
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,600
Damn! What's going on?!

446
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,229
Who the hell are you?!

447
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:34,400
He doesn't seem to be one of
the Hidden Leaf's reinforcements...

448
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,861
You don't think this guy's after
the Forbidden Jutsu as well?

449
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:40,198
Oh... The fact that you know about
the Forbidden Jutsu means...

450
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,990
You guys are the band of thieves?

451
00:36:43,934 --> 00:36:45,226
Makes me wonder, though.

452
00:36:45,251 --> 00:36:47,503
Is it that awesome?
That Forbidden Jutsu?

453
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:51,273
If that's the case,
I think I want that Forbidden Jutsu, too.

454
00:36:51,298 --> 00:36:53,669
What? Are you planning
to grab it from us?

455
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:55,087
So? What should we do?

456
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,812
Go ahead and kill him!

457
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:04,680
After him!

458
00:37:06,938 --> 00:37:08,439
What is this slime?

459
00:37:15,341 --> 00:37:16,634
I've been blinded!

460
00:37:16,659 --> 00:37:18,494
Spread out! We'll surround him!

461
00:37:27,803 --> 00:37:29,210
<i>This chakra flow...</i>

462
00:37:29,794 --> 00:37:32,088
<i>Their movements have become faster
all of a sudden.</i>

463
00:37:38,141 --> 00:37:39,184
<i>Barrier jutsu?!</i>

464
00:37:39,835 --> 00:37:40,988
Let's go!

465
00:37:57,652 --> 00:37:58,778
<i>Damn!</i>

466
00:37:58,803 --> 00:37:59,804
It's over!

467
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:14,233
How far do you intend to follow me?

468
00:38:14,269 --> 00:38:18,565
How far? You're the one who said
until we clear the forest.

469
00:38:18,774 --> 00:38:20,359
I did say that, but...

470
00:38:20,723 --> 00:38:25,879
<i>Thing is, there's only forest
between the fort and the hidden village!</i>

471
00:38:27,027 --> 00:38:28,486
You people, too?

472
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,851
Looks like we'll complete our mission
without incident.

473
00:38:33,982 --> 00:38:36,109
Oh! We reached the village!

474
00:39:01,227 --> 00:39:03,437
What? No one here?

475
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:05,065
Hello!

476
00:39:05,981 --> 00:39:08,901
Is anyone... anybody here?

477
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:10,244
Sai.

478
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:11,488
Yes...

479
00:39:15,617 --> 00:39:21,331
Hey! Hotaru is back! Isn't anyone here?!

480
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:26,872
Hmm...

481
00:39:30,273 --> 00:39:31,900
Okay! Hold on a sec!

482
00:39:32,594 --> 00:39:33,971
Oh, Naruto!

483
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:35,663
Good grief...

484
00:39:38,456 --> 00:39:43,000
Emergency! Fire! There's a fire!

485
00:39:53,799 --> 00:39:56,093
Oh, so you were here.

486
00:40:05,585 --> 00:40:07,670
Sorry to startle all of you!

487
00:40:07,807 --> 00:40:10,435
But you all wouldn't come on out.

488
00:40:10,781 --> 00:40:13,241
Hotaru is back after being away
a long time!

489
00:40:13,266 --> 00:40:15,226
You should welcome her!

490
00:40:19,277 --> 00:40:21,613
What? What's the matter
with all of you?

491
00:40:22,522 --> 00:40:23,492
Hotaru!

492
00:40:24,226 --> 00:40:25,141
Uncle...

493
00:40:25,928 --> 00:40:27,597
Thank you for all you've done.

494
00:40:27,622 --> 00:40:29,875
I am responsible for this village.

495
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:33,889
I heard from Lord En no Gyoja about
what to do if the worse happens.

496
00:40:34,276 --> 00:40:36,653
Please leave the rest to us.

497
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:39,478
All right then, we will be on our way.

498
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:42,682
Uh, no, just a moment. We
haven't had a chance to thank you.

499
00:40:42,707 --> 00:40:45,168
- At least let us...
- We appreciate your thoughtfulness.

500
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:48,753
However, we left our teammate back
at Mount Katsuragi.

501
00:40:49,165 --> 00:40:51,960
I see... That's too bad.

502
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,368
Come on, let's return to Sakura.

503
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,870
Oh, okay...

504
00:41:01,836 --> 00:41:02,772
Naruto.

505
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:06,816
I...

506
00:41:11,523 --> 00:41:12,775
You'll be fine.

507
00:41:16,198 --> 00:41:17,168
Thank you.

508
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,276
What's the matter, Naruto?

509
00:41:27,565 --> 00:41:30,151
Sorry, Captain Yamato.

510
00:41:30,176 --> 00:41:31,761
Would you mind going on ahead
without me?

511
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,908
I'm returning to that village.

512
00:41:34,088 --> 00:41:35,130
Return?

513
00:41:35,236 --> 00:41:37,571
Something keeps... bothering me.

514
00:41:38,731 --> 00:41:41,359
I can't help but think about
the way those villagers looked at her.

515
00:41:42,494 --> 00:41:43,954
Wait, Naruto!

516
00:41:53,132 --> 00:41:55,509
You must be exhausted after
your long journey, Hotaru.

517
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:57,162
Come...

518
00:41:58,248 --> 00:41:59,249
Umm...

519
00:42:06,014 --> 00:42:07,015
Follow me.

520
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,905
What is the Chief thinking?

521
00:42:13,141 --> 00:42:14,976
Does he really intend to
shelter her here?

522
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,349
You've got to be kidding.

523
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:18,655
If something happens, we'll get--

524
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,431
Hush! You talk too much.

525
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:29,463
Should I have not come back?

526
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:30,965
Of course not.

527
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,300
You're finally home.

528
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,718
You must get some rest.

529
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,555
Thank you.

530
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:40,724
Well then...

531
00:42:45,726 --> 00:42:49,563
We finally meet the granddaughter
of En no Gyoja.

532
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:50,693
Who's there?!

533
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:06,125
We knew you would rely
on this village.

534
00:43:09,989 --> 00:43:12,367
You're the ones who attacked the fort!

535
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,802
Someone, help! Bandits!

536
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:20,639
Uncle, please open the door! Uncle!

537
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:22,057
Somebody!

538
00:43:23,595 --> 00:43:24,596
It's useless.

539
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,855
Now, hand over the Forbidden Jutsu.

540
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:28,881
No!

541
00:43:41,936 --> 00:43:43,312
Don't give us trouble!

542
00:43:43,398 --> 00:43:47,068
Hey, hey... Be more gentle
when handling a lady.

543
00:43:48,205 --> 00:43:50,374
You should talk.

544
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:52,977
Bro.

545
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,969
So this is the hidden jutsu in question...

546
00:44:13,959 --> 00:44:15,085
So it was rigged, eh?

547
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:17,212
Sassy kid...

548
00:44:17,329 --> 00:44:19,331
After her! Don't let her get away.

549
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:27,915
<i>To think they had already made their move
on the Tsuchigumo village...</i>

550
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:30,751
<i>I have to get away from here.</i>

551
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,217
So she ran into the forest...

552
00:44:59,712 --> 00:45:01,881
Found you, girlie.

553
00:45:03,322 --> 00:45:05,074
<i>Water Style: Raging Waves!</i>

554
00:45:12,915 --> 00:45:16,168
Don't let a petty jutsu like that
bring you down, Chushin.

555
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:18,924
Shut up! She just caught me
by surprise, is all.

556
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:24,513
Playtime is over. Tell me.

557
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,056
Where is the Forbidden Jutsu?

558
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:31,770
What a pain.

559
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,315
I'd talk now if I were you.

560
00:45:35,624 --> 00:45:39,878
Benten might look like a girl,
but he's scary when he's mad.

561
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:41,349
I won't talk!

562
00:45:41,485 --> 00:45:44,405
That is my people's last hope.

563
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:47,152
Argh! This is getting ridiculous.

564
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:53,141
If you don't want to talk,
I'll help you get into the mood.

565
00:45:55,416 --> 00:45:56,667
Don't kill her.

566
00:45:57,798 --> 00:46:00,176
That's all up to her.

567
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:10,297
What?!

568
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:20,319
What's all this racket?
Can't a guy even take a nap?

569
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:23,071
Lord Utakata!

570
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:25,888
You! You're still alive?

571
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:27,786
We got you back there for sure!

572
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,917
Well, sorry to disappoint you.

573
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:41,924
It's not like I want to fight you guys...

574
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:44,676
But I have business with her too.

575
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:47,888
What? She's gone?!

576
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:49,681
What's up with that?!

577
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:55,938
I'm not sure myself.
This is where I hid Hotaru.

578
00:46:56,563 --> 00:47:00,943
Then there was a loud noise
and when I rushed over, she was...

579
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:04,112
All right. I'll help you find her.

580
00:47:04,301 --> 00:47:06,136
Tell me where you've searched already.

581
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:11,203
Well, um... We haven't started
the search yet.

582
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,109
What?!

583
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,583
Why didn't you search
for her immediately?

584
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:20,587
Judging by the damage,
it's obvious something happened!

585
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,631
Yes... but...

586
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:30,514
What's wrong with you?!
Isn't she one of your people?!

587
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,807
Enough, Naruto.

588
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,353
Yelling won't help.

589
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:39,231
Captain Yamato.
What are you doing here?

590
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:43,193
We were also worried,
so we rushed back.

591
00:47:43,654 --> 00:47:44,864
It seems we were right.

592
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,614
When did you last see her?

593
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:49,616
Just a while ago.

594
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:54,079
After you brought Hotaru here,
I showed her to this room.

595
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,416
Then not much time has passed.

596
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:59,084
Let's hurry, Naruto.

597
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,210
But...

598
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:08,135
Her safety is our main concern
right now.

599
00:48:15,253 --> 00:48:18,047
Lord Utakata, you came to save me!

600
00:48:18,656 --> 00:48:23,369
That's not quite the case,
but we'd better do something here.

601
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,697
What's with this guy?

602
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:31,686
I thought our jutsu hit him that time.

603
00:48:32,095 --> 00:48:35,932
Are you scheming to steal
our treasure away from us?

604
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:37,748
I won't let you.

605
00:48:39,724 --> 00:48:40,725
<i>Acid Flower!</i>

606
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:47,758
Nango, come back!

607
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:52,554
Oh... It missed.

608
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:55,223
Why you--!

609
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:09,947
Surround him!
We'll bring him down this time.

610
00:49:21,244 --> 00:49:22,495
He's outside our formation!

611
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:24,795
So long.

612
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:26,046
Not so fast!

613
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:27,339
Lord Utakata!

614
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,807
He's fast.

615
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:42,404
They can't have gone far.
Let's go after them.

616
00:49:42,429 --> 00:49:43,513
Forget it.

617
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:48,819
Boss.

618
00:49:49,135 --> 00:49:52,180
Why? Are you just going to let
our treasure get away?

619
00:49:56,988 --> 00:49:59,282
This is the Mist's Bingo Book.

620
00:50:00,074 --> 00:50:03,118
We've stumbled across
a very interesting guy.

621
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:10,257
Meaning his head's worth enough
to be in this book?

622
00:50:10,468 --> 00:50:12,535
Wow... 50 million ryo.

623
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:14,386
We're in luck.

624
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:17,840
The girl's jutsu is worth a fortune,
and now this.

625
00:50:17,865 --> 00:50:19,595
We'll be rolling in money.

626
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:24,688
But with a bounty this high,
he's bound to be a formidable foe.

627
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:30,235
Hah! Don't get cold feet now!
This is our big chance.

628
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:32,195
What? I'm just...

629
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:37,075
Hey! Pipe down.
So what'll we do, Boss?

630
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:44,875
Let's see...

631
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:58,597
<i>It's my fault. I...</i>

632
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:03,393
<i>I should've returned right away.</i>

633
00:51:04,797 --> 00:51:06,424
Can I ask you a question?

634
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:09,292
Our mission was to protect the girl

635
00:51:09,317 --> 00:51:11,777
until she reached
Tsuchigumo village safely, right?

636
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:13,945
That was supposed to be it.

637
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:18,828
But if we can't guarantee her safety,

638
00:51:18,853 --> 00:51:20,104
then the mission is meaningless.

639
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:24,350
This mission is based on a treaty
which was drawn up

640
00:51:24,375 --> 00:51:28,212
by the Third Hokage and En no Gyoja
of the Tsuchigumo Clan.

641
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:33,799
So if the current Tsuchigumo Clan
cannot protect her,

642
00:51:34,139 --> 00:51:35,933
then it's our job to do so.

643
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:46,311
Sai, can you scan the entire area
and search for her?

644
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:47,729
Understood.

645
00:51:54,354 --> 00:51:55,884
<i>Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll.</i>

646
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:04,454
<i>Hold on...
We'll find you for sure!</i>

647
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:27,018
Lord Utakata, where are we?

648
00:52:38,454 --> 00:52:39,706
Wow...

649
00:52:42,625 --> 00:52:44,210
So high!

650
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:06,892
This should be good.

651
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:10,979
I thought I was done for.

652
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:13,440
You are amazing, after all.

653
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:18,445
Don't get me wrong.
I didn't mean to save you.

654
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,156
Then why did you come?

655
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:24,426
Well... Let's just say
I became curious

656
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:27,162
about this Forbidden Jutsu
those guys seem to want so badly.

657
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:32,834
You're lying. You're not like that.

658
00:53:33,538 --> 00:53:35,434
Never can tell.

659
00:53:35,459 --> 00:53:38,391
There's not a person in the world
who doesn't love the smell of money.

660
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,550
Don't pretend to be a villain.

661
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:50,727
You have a knack for putting me
off balance.

662
00:53:53,099 --> 00:53:55,309
But what will you do now?

663
00:53:55,879 --> 00:53:58,381
Those guys aren't the only ones
who'll target that jutsu.

664
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:01,154
Others are bound to turn up.

665
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,114
You're right.

666
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:06,243
That's why I must get stronger.

667
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:07,911
That's why I want to become
your stu--

668
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:10,705
Stop right there. I'm not listening.

669
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:14,751
Besides, this keepsake of
your grandfather or whatever...

670
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,962
Why are you so determined to protect it?

671
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,546
Well...

672
00:54:19,678 --> 00:54:21,888
It's to honor the wishes
of my master.

673
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:28,056
Grandfather was also my first master.

674
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:32,018
A master and student must
be one in thought.

675
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:35,355
That's why I want to fulfill the dream
that my grandfather could not.

676
00:54:36,526 --> 00:54:39,028
In order to restore
the Tsuchigumo Clan,

677
00:54:39,292 --> 00:54:42,253
I cannot lose this jutsu.

678
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:46,116
Hmph... One in thought?

679
00:54:47,391 --> 00:54:49,103
Such a stupid delusion.

680
00:54:51,115 --> 00:54:52,575
Where are you going?

681
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:55,774
I'm under no obligation
to stick around.

682
00:54:56,089 --> 00:54:58,300
If you want to play master and student,
go somewhere else.

683
00:54:58,530 --> 00:55:02,701
This isn't a game!
I'm serious about you!

684
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:05,176
I want to call you my master!

685
00:55:05,743 --> 00:55:07,453
You can't stop me, you know.

686
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:11,624
I know that.
But my feelings won't change.

687
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:13,977
That is why...

688
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:15,075
Huh?!

689
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:24,446
I-Idiot! What are you doing?!

690
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:27,782
I want you to see me...

691
00:55:30,407 --> 00:55:32,534
Everything about me.

692
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:05,236
Hotaru... you...

693
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:08,948
How could they?

694
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:12,118
No one knows about this...

695
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:15,705
But I didn't want to hide it from you.

696
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:17,957
Please, Lord Utakata...

697
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:19,959
- I...
- Don't say it!

698
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:28,212
Damn it!

699
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:34,057
<i>Hidden Jutsu: Kirisame.</i>

700
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:42,607
Crap!

701
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,823
As I thought...
This rain is Kirisame...

702
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:51,449
Utakata.

703
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:54,077
There is no escape for you now.

704
00:56:54,897 --> 00:56:55,898
What's going on?

705
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:59,082
We cannot keep the village
waiting any longer.

706
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:02,585
You guys sure are persistent.
Stay back, Hotaru.

707
00:57:05,518 --> 00:57:07,145
<i>Water Style: Water Whip!</i>

708
00:57:09,339 --> 00:57:09,982
Hotaru!

709
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:15,932
I'll say it once more.
Cease resisting and come with us.

710
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:19,853
If you try anything, this girl will die.

711
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:22,647
Lord Utakata...

712
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:28,069
Let me make it clear that
she is nothing to me.

713
00:57:28,458 --> 00:57:30,710
I couldn't care less what happens.

714
00:57:31,033 --> 00:57:33,535
I see. We'll see about that.

715
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:48,047
I see that worked.
Now return to the village with us.

716
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:50,925
No matter how many times you ask,
the answer will be the same.

717
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:53,052
Then we have no choice.

718
00:57:54,965 --> 00:57:56,384
<i>Lightning Style: Earth Flash!</i>

719
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:02,312
Lord Utakata!

720
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:03,968
Don't take this personally.

721
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:07,775
We absolutely must take him
back to our village.

722
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:10,987
Such cruelty... Please stop.

723
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:13,573
This isn't enough to kill him.

724
00:58:13,954 --> 00:58:15,997
I'm just restricting a little of
his strength.

725
00:58:17,896 --> 00:58:21,775
Stop it! Just what did Lord Utakata
do anyway?!

726
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:25,043
Utakata is a heinous criminal
who killed his master

727
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:26,878
and escaped from the village.

728
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:32,050
We need to tie him up. Get started.

729
00:58:32,353 --> 00:58:33,048
- Yes sir!
- Yes sir!

730
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:36,597

731
00:58:38,803 --> 00:58:39,493

00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:44,521
<i>What's going on?</i>

733
00:58:47,131 --> 00:58:49,716
You guys are pretty rotten,
taking a hostage.

734
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,194
Naruto!

735
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:57,867
Sorry to keep you waiting!

736
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:05,833
You people...

737
00:59:06,294 --> 00:59:07,462
Are you all right?

738
00:59:07,665 --> 00:59:08,666
Yeah...

739
00:59:08,873 --> 00:59:10,499
But why are you here?

740
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:12,257
You were also worried about Hotaru?

741
00:59:12,282 --> 00:59:15,327
Yeah, right. It was just
sheer coincidence.

742
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:19,264
But... these guys didn't come here
for Hotaru.

743
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:20,765
What do you mean?

744
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:23,017
And who are these guys?

745
00:59:30,625 --> 00:59:31,626
<i>That mask...</i>

746
00:59:33,927 --> 00:59:36,263
<i>I see... So their target is...</i>

747
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:38,491
Master!

748
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:45,164
<i>Why are the Hidden Leaf here?</i>

749
00:59:49,332 --> 00:59:51,042
Please let that girl go.

750
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:52,672
No!

751
00:59:54,866 --> 00:59:57,243
In that case! We'll take her back...

752
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,554
by force!

00:59:59,673 --> 01:00:00,883

I'll take the one in the middle.

757
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:27,123
You handle the ones around him.
We'll attack together.

758
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:29,792
Got it. But... these Black Ops are...

759
01:00:32,017 --> 01:00:33,890
Let's see how it goes for
a bit longer...

760
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:36,883
<i>We need to find out what
their purpose is.</i>

761
01:00:43,728 --> 01:00:44,729

<i>Hidden Jutsu: Kirisame!</i>

What's with this rain?!

764
01:01:02,967 --> 01:01:05,720
It's a jutsu that eats away the chakra
it comes into contact with.

765
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:07,043
It's called the Kirisame Jutsu!

766
01:01:07,751 --> 01:01:08,752
Why you...!

767
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:10,791
Go!

768
01:01:13,528 --> 01:01:14,988
Stop! Don't be hasty!

769
01:01:15,416 --> 01:01:16,258
Let's go!

Master!

773
01:01:57,891 --> 01:01:59,810
I need you to stay quiet
for a while.

774
01:02:04,048 --> 01:02:05,583
What the hell are you doing?!

775
01:02:05,624 --> 01:02:06,294

776
01:02:07,582 --> 01:02:08,583
Wait.

777
01:02:09,481 --> 01:02:13,318
We are on a mission to guard
that girl.

778
01:02:13,901 --> 01:02:15,235
Please return her to us.

779
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:19,277
Yeah! Give her back, you!

780
01:02:20,241 --> 01:02:23,787
You are ANBU Black Ops
from the Hidden Mist,

781
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:26,451
and the one you seek
is this man, correct?

782
01:02:27,082 --> 01:02:30,377
Huh? ANBU Black Ops...
from the Hidden Mist?

783
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:37,336
<i>I get it now...</i>

784
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,638
<i>So that means he is a...</i>

785
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:43,267
Utakata is a rogue ninja from
the Hidden Mist

786
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:44,752
and is listed in the Bingo Book.

787
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:47,430
These men have come after him.

788
01:02:48,288 --> 01:02:53,126
So these guys...
aren't ninja who are after her?

789
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:55,062
They're after Utakata?

790
01:02:58,004 --> 01:03:01,007
She has nothing to do with you.
Please release her.

791
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:04,781
Then we'll exchange her for him.

792
01:03:09,582 --> 01:03:10,583
No.

793
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:12,830
That, we can't do.

794
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:14,332
What?!

795
01:03:14,609 --> 01:03:17,404
That girl seems to be very fond
of this man.

796
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:21,589
If we hand him over to you,
no doubt, she will pursue you.

797
01:03:22,209 --> 01:03:24,086
Then we'll be in trouble.

798
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:26,552
So we can't turn him over.

799
01:03:26,928 --> 01:03:28,971
Then... neither can we...

800
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:32,433
If we resort to force,

801
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:36,521
it may have major effects beyond this
village, and erupt into a full-scale war.

802
01:03:36,735 --> 01:03:38,153
Are you willing to go that far?

803
01:03:47,878 --> 01:03:49,046
<i>The Hidden Mist?</i>

804
01:03:56,584 --> 01:03:57,585
Captain Yamato.

805
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:07,885
Men of the Hidden Leaf...

806
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:17,228
I command this unit from
behind the scenes.

807
01:04:18,604 --> 01:04:21,524
I am Tsurugi, head of
the Hidden Mist ANBU Black Ops.

808
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:25,570
It is certainly not our desire
to escalate this

809
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:27,697
into a war between nations.

810
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:30,867
Certainly, we can still negotiate?

811
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:33,160
Yes, I agree.

812
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:43,045
You're...

813
01:04:44,463 --> 01:04:48,593
Let us meet. Just you and I...

814
01:04:52,544 --> 01:04:53,921
And Utakata.

815
01:04:55,199 --> 01:04:56,325
Understood.

816
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:01,188
You two stay here.

817
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:20,975
Then until you complete
your mission,

818
01:05:21,187 --> 01:05:23,961
we will postpone
apprehending Utakata.

819
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:27,089
As soon as her safety
is guaranteed,

820
01:05:27,253 --> 01:05:28,671
I will notify you.

821
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:34,263
Please keep in mind that should
you go back on our agreement,

822
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:37,016
war between our nations
may be inevitable.

823
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,043
I understand.

824
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:44,190
Hmm...

825
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:49,612
You people are absurd.
I'll do as I please.

826
01:05:50,448 --> 01:05:51,646
Not likely.

827
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:55,910
Until our mission is over,
you will remain with us.

828
01:05:56,702 --> 01:06:00,665
After that, it's all between you
and the Hidden Mist.

829
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:03,084
Fine.

830
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:04,543
Tell me...

831
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:07,421
Just what did you do
in Hidden Mist Village?

832
01:06:08,839 --> 01:06:11,008
That... is none of your business.

833
01:06:12,918 --> 01:06:13,919
My apologies.

834
01:06:14,926 --> 01:06:16,469
I want to speak to him alone.

835
01:06:18,015 --> 01:06:19,433
I'll wait over there.

836
01:06:42,456 --> 01:06:43,457
Captain Yamato!

837
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:45,167
How did your talk go?

838
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:48,963
Oh, it went well.

839
01:06:51,552 --> 01:06:52,511
Where are those two?

840
01:06:53,067 --> 01:06:54,526
Having a discussion.

841
01:06:55,636 --> 01:06:59,890
Is it true...
that Utakata is a rogue ninja?

842
01:07:00,674 --> 01:07:01,334
Yeah...

843
01:07:07,917 --> 01:07:12,422
Don't give us trouble.
Return to the Hidden Mist.

844
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:16,198
Humph! No, thanks!

845
01:07:16,657 --> 01:07:18,409
Why would I go back
just to get killed...?

846
01:07:19,243 --> 01:07:20,619
The village has changed.

847
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:25,833
We no longer have the practices
that once gave us the nickname,

848
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:27,460
"Blood Mist Village."

849
01:07:28,227 --> 01:07:30,479
But while things may seem peaceful,

850
01:07:30,504 --> 01:07:33,049
it is a delicate power balance
between the Five Great Nations.

851
01:07:33,674 --> 01:07:36,886
The importance of what you possess
increases each year,

852
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:39,885
and research into its use
has also been stepped up.

853
01:07:40,547 --> 01:07:46,136
The village needs that power,
so you certainly won't be killed.

854
01:07:47,354 --> 01:07:49,607
I don't trust anyone anymore.

855
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:56,072
My master... tried to kill me...

856
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:59,366
along with that thing inside me.

857
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:18,052
I sacrificed myself for the sake
of the village.

858
01:08:19,144 --> 01:08:23,357
I trusted my master's words...
and did as he ordered.

859
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:26,519
And he betrayed my trust...

860
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,312
he tried to kill me!

861
01:08:32,955 --> 01:08:34,123
<i>What?!</i>

862
01:08:38,572 --> 01:08:42,243
<i>Th-This... power...</i>

863
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:43,994
<i>Wait!</i>

864
01:08:43,994 --> 01:08:46,705
<i>Stop! Stop!</i>

865
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,676
No, Utakata! He didn't...

866
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:02,263
Harusame didn't try to kill you.

867
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:04,098
It wasn't like that.

868
01:09:05,182 --> 01:09:08,894
That cursed deed he performed on you...

869
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:11,480
He was trying to separate it
from you.

870
01:09:12,273 --> 01:09:13,691
He was trying to save you.

871
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:17,528
Like I'd believe such a story...

872
01:09:18,511 --> 01:09:20,555
You've grown senile.

873
01:09:21,565 --> 01:09:22,816
I speak the truth...

874
01:09:23,005 --> 01:09:28,302
My master... No, that man used me
and tried to kill me.

875
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:32,668
And in the aftermath... he died.

876
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:37,590
If you ask the villagers,
they will say I killed him.

877
01:09:38,257 --> 01:09:40,926
Utakata... Return to the village.

878
01:09:41,367 --> 01:09:44,704
Then you will know that
I am not lying.

879
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:46,307
No, thanks.

880
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:49,268
Then, we have no choice
but to kill you.

881
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:51,520
As you please.

882
01:09:52,062 --> 01:09:54,315
And I will do as I please.

883
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:08,329
Master!

884
01:10:11,665 --> 01:10:12,666
Let her go.

885
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:14,382
Yes, sir!

886
01:10:20,299 --> 01:10:21,300
Master!

887
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,601
Enough!

888
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:27,223
Never call me that again.

889
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:36,607
Understand?

890
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:43,405
Men of the Hidden Leaf, as agreed,
we will retreat for now.

891
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:47,284
Let us pray that both our missions
are successful.

892
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:52,164
However, we will continue to
keep watch over you.

893
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:54,083
Understood.

894
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:55,417
Farewell.

895
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:57,336
Scatter!

896
01:11:02,032 --> 01:11:03,450
Oh dear...

897
01:11:12,142 --> 01:11:14,726
Now then, where do
we go from here?

898
01:11:15,145 --> 01:11:18,732
It's best that we don't return
to the Tsuchigumo village.

899
01:11:19,149 --> 01:11:20,567
Yes, you're right.

900
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:25,614
If it's no longer secure as a ninja
village, her safety is questionable.

901
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:31,578
Then it may be better to return to
Mount Katsuragi and rethink our stance.

902
01:11:32,318 --> 01:11:33,694
I also wish to go back.

903
01:11:34,498 --> 01:11:36,500
I want to make sure Tonbei
is all right.

904
01:11:37,626 --> 01:11:40,087
Although, the ones after
the Forbidden Jutsu

905
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:43,590
may also go back to Katsuragi,
so it may not be safe either.

906
01:11:44,174 --> 01:11:46,677
Let's join up with
Tonbei and Sakura,

907
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:48,563
then decide on our next move.

908
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:52,891
Utakata, you too.

909
01:12:09,241 --> 01:12:10,242
Are you all right?

910
01:12:11,076 --> 01:12:12,077
Uh-huh...

911
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:16,123
I wonder why he doesn't want me
to call him "Master."

912
01:12:21,378 --> 01:12:24,340
<i>Utakata is a heinous criminal
who killed his master</i>

913
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:25,966
<i>and escaped from the village.</i>

914
01:12:27,634 --> 01:12:31,680
<i>Just what happened between...
Lord Utakata and his master?</i>

915
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:35,726
We don't know what
the relationship is

916
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:37,227
between Utakata and
the Hidden Mist.

917
01:12:37,811 --> 01:12:40,105
But that's not important.

918
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:43,110
If you've already decided
you want to be his student,

919
01:12:43,135 --> 01:12:44,319
then who cares?

920
01:12:44,344 --> 01:12:46,721
It matters.
I want to become strong.

921
01:12:46,945 --> 01:12:48,614
In order to restore my clan's honor.

922
01:12:49,239 --> 01:12:50,741
That's why I want to
learn from him.

923
01:12:52,409 --> 01:12:56,538
I can tell. You want him to
teach you personally, right?

924
01:12:57,122 --> 01:12:58,832
It's not like that...

925
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,252
Well, I felt the same way too.

926
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:08,217
I don't have any memories
of my parents.

927
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:09,807
Huh?

928
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:14,973
So maybe that's why...
when I traveled with the Pervy Sage...

929
01:13:15,682 --> 01:13:19,520
I wondered if that's what
it felt like to have a parent.

930
01:13:20,312 --> 01:13:23,816
And I acted spoiled
with him sometimes.

931
01:13:24,608 --> 01:13:28,070
But training isn't that easy.

932
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:30,626
You have to think things
through yourself,

933
01:13:30,651 --> 01:13:32,445
and learn the technique by yourself.

934
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:35,744
Otherwise, you'll never get better.

935
01:13:39,184 --> 01:13:41,895
If the Pervy Sage hadn't been there,

936
01:13:42,042 --> 01:13:44,420
I wouldn't even have realized
something that basic.

937
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:45,985
We're not alone...

938
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:48,715
Just the thought that
someone is nearby,

939
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:50,426
watching over us...

940
01:13:50,467 --> 01:13:52,136
that alone makes us strong.

941
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:57,850
I understand how you feel.
I envy you, Naruto.

942
01:13:59,017 --> 01:14:04,606
Just like you, I'm going to think of
Lord Utakata as my master and...

943
01:14:06,233 --> 01:14:08,318
Hey... you look pale...

944
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:11,447
I'm... okay...

945
01:14:13,073 --> 01:14:13,784
Hey!

946
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:16,790
You're burning up...

947
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:19,580
You're hurt!

948
01:14:20,747 --> 01:14:21,748
Is it from that fight?!

949
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:27,504
Captain Yamato!

950
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:30,841
I'll see to her.

951
01:14:36,151 --> 01:14:37,819
Can you go and get some
medicinal herbs?

952
01:14:39,148 --> 01:14:44,376
The dokudami plant should be
abundant around here in the moist areas.

953
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:48,442
It has heart-shaped leaves
which are purple underneath.

954
01:14:49,254 --> 01:14:51,340
The leaves are purple underneath, right?

955
01:14:51,573 --> 01:14:52,574
Yes.

956
01:14:53,185 --> 01:14:54,144
All right!

957
01:14:58,410 --> 01:14:59,411
What's wrong?

958
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:02,164
Hotaru is injured...

959
01:15:03,415 --> 01:15:04,541
Let us be.

960
01:15:06,043 --> 01:15:06,904
All right...

961
01:15:15,145 --> 01:15:17,648
Moist areas...

962
01:15:17,718 --> 01:15:20,054
I guess I should search
by the riverbank!

963
01:15:21,892 --> 01:15:24,895
There! That's have to be it.

964
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:34,947
Huh? What the hell?!
This is just Dokudami!

965
01:15:34,988 --> 01:15:37,950
Aw man, there were lots
of 'em along the way!

966
01:15:39,603 --> 01:15:40,562
Damn it!

967
01:15:40,793 --> 01:15:42,628
I wasted so much time!

968
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:54,550
What the...?

969
01:16:00,013 --> 01:16:01,932
What the hell is this...?

970
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:06,311
The Forbidden Jutsu of
the Tsuchigumo Clan

971
01:16:06,436 --> 01:16:10,232
It was engraved...
into this child's very own body.

972
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,193
How could they do such a thing?

973
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:16,989
To hell with Forbidden Jutsu...
To hell with the clan...

974
01:16:17,364 --> 01:16:18,574
To hell with one's master!

975
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:22,244
And all these selfish guys who
do atrocious things

976
01:16:22,676 --> 01:16:25,387
to those who serve them
without a hint of remorse.

977
01:16:26,331 --> 01:16:30,210
They think of us... as mere tools.

978
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:33,880
Tools... who don't speak.

979
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:41,888
Hotaru...
