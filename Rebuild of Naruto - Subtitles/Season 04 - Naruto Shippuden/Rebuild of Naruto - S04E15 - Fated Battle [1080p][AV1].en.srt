1
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:26,067
He's coming along nicely. Now...

2
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:30,659
Will you still emerge as a snake?
Or will you transform into a hawk?

3
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:33,208
We shall see, Sasuke...

4
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,710
That girl's late...

5
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,130
How long does it take to
pick up supplies...?

6
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,767
I wish it would get dark soon...

7
00:02:14,358 --> 00:02:16,069
After Jugo and Suigetsu turn in,

8
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,180
I'll make my move on Sasuke
while he sleeps!

9
00:02:20,408 --> 00:02:22,035
I'm so excited!

10
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,381
This feeling...

11
00:02:37,911 --> 00:02:39,204
Well, Kiba?!

12
00:02:40,006 --> 00:02:42,967
I'm concentrating, trying to
single out Sasuke's faint scent!

13
00:02:43,284 --> 00:02:45,328
So shut up! You're distracting me!

14
00:02:51,575 --> 00:02:54,954
<i>There's no mistake...
They're steadily approaching.</i>

15
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,385
<i>One... two...</i>

16
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,721
<i>Their chakra is strong too.</i>

17
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,895
<i>There are quite a few.</i>

18
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:09,192
<i>I sense non-human chakra too.</i>

19
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,191
<i>Dogs?</i>

20
00:03:11,646 --> 00:03:13,231
<i>Are they tracking our scent?</i>

21
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:16,946
<i>Is it Akatsuki?
Or maybe the Hidden Leaf?</i>

22
00:03:18,214 --> 00:03:19,340
Jugo.

23
00:03:19,837 --> 00:03:22,298
I'm going to go check on Karin.

24
00:03:22,762 --> 00:03:23,763
Yeah.

25
00:03:29,617 --> 00:03:31,160
Wh-What...?

26
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,129
Wake up, Sasuke!

27
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,881
We're going to have company!
What do we do?!

28
00:03:37,507 --> 00:03:40,134
<i>Sasuke just waking up... is also nice!</i>

29
00:03:40,196 --> 00:03:41,823
We're escaping. Get ready.

30
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:47,977
Jugo, mark every Akatsuki hideout
that we know of.

31
00:03:55,184 --> 00:03:56,727
You're okay now, Sasuke?

32
00:03:57,111 --> 00:04:02,033
Yeah. I've been healing a lot faster
since I absorbed Orochimaru's power.

33
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,786
<i>So this is the Power of the White Snake...</i>

34
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,147
Whether it's Akatsuki
or the Hidden Leaf,

35
00:04:07,172 --> 00:04:09,465
they might have information
on Itachi.

36
00:04:09,668 --> 00:04:12,129
So why don't we ambush them, Sasuke?

37
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,713
Based on the numbers you reported,

38
00:04:16,053 --> 00:04:19,132
it's most likely the Hidden Leaf.

39
00:04:19,998 --> 00:04:22,500
Akatsuki always work
in two-man cells.

40
00:04:22,891 --> 00:04:27,020
Which means an ambush
would be a waste of time.

41
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:30,043
Exactly. Forget the Hidden Leaf.

42
00:04:30,545 --> 00:04:32,297
Then what'll we do?

43
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,149
Itachi is our only priority.

44
00:04:34,332 --> 00:04:36,002
Once we locate him...

45
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,778
If worst comes to worst,
you three must stop the Hidden Leaf.

46
00:04:39,192 --> 00:04:43,783
For now, Team Hebi will use
the information gathered by Jugo

47
00:04:43,808 --> 00:04:46,185
and check out Akatsuki hideouts
one by one.

48
00:04:46,436 --> 00:04:47,437
All right...

49
00:04:47,802 --> 00:04:48,652
Let's go.

50
00:04:55,664 --> 00:04:56,957
Help me out for a second.

51
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,219
With that?

52
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,509
Can you gather as many birds
as you can?

53
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:02,972
What do you plan on doing?

54
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,888
This is Sasuke's old outfit.

55
00:05:05,976 --> 00:05:08,354
It's soaked with his sweat and scent,
so we'll use this to...

56
00:05:08,395 --> 00:05:11,398
Why would you have an outfit
that Sasuke threw away?

57
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:14,809
Uh...! Th-That...
That's not important...

58
00:05:14,834 --> 00:05:16,670
Y-You jerk!

59
00:05:17,672 --> 00:05:19,330
A-Anyway...

60
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,821
<i>I hate to do this, but...</i>

61
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:25,826
Sensory-type ninja from different
villages have their own specialties.

62
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:29,672
The Hidden Leaf often
uses ninja hounds.

63
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:31,699
So we'll use that to
our advantage.

64
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,753
What's wrong, Kiba?

65
00:05:37,193 --> 00:05:39,862
This is bad! Sasuke is starting to move!

66
00:05:40,476 --> 00:05:43,395
Let's hurry!
Sasuke is going after Itachi!

67
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,887
Hold it, something's wrong!

68
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,098
Sasuke's scent is dispersing!

69
00:05:49,388 --> 00:05:52,350
Not only that,
it's scattering in all directions!

70
00:05:52,702 --> 00:05:55,913
He's onto us and is taking countermeasures.

71
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,358
On to us? But how?!

72
00:05:58,679 --> 00:06:00,681
I don't know what kind of power.

73
00:06:00,706 --> 00:06:05,502
But I'm guessing he has a
skilled sensory-type ninja on his side.

74
00:06:05,686 --> 00:06:07,146
The distance is too great,

75
00:06:07,171 --> 00:06:08,965
so I can't guide you by wireless.

76
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,857
I'm the only one
who can pursue him...

77
00:06:10,882 --> 00:06:13,986
But they're all the same scent.
Which one do we follow?

78
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,835
I'll find him if I have to search
every blade of grass!

79
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,754
With whatever means necessary!

80
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:22,423
<i>Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

81
00:06:31,587 --> 00:06:33,199
<i>Water Style: Four Shark Shower!</i>

82
00:07:00,665 --> 00:07:04,568
As good as you are,
even you can't dodge all these...

83
00:07:12,584 --> 00:07:14,445
I stand corrected.

84
00:07:35,514 --> 00:07:39,322
I've always wanted to go
head-to-head with you like this.

85
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:49,864
Even Samehada is happy.

86
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,129
<i>Water Style:
Water Shark Bomb Jutsu!</i>

87
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,200
<i>Fire Style:
Fireball Jutsu!</i>

88
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:18,782
It's over.

89
00:08:19,717 --> 00:08:23,433
With the Sharingan, you're able
to find my faint shadow from behind

90
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:26,006
and attack even in the mist...

91
00:08:26,171 --> 00:08:27,371
Impressive...

92
00:08:27,937 --> 00:08:29,637
Is what I'd normally say.

93
00:08:32,493 --> 00:08:34,982
So you saw through me and
used a water clone, huh?

94
00:08:39,734 --> 00:08:43,879
It's been a long time
since I've had to do this...

95
00:08:46,672 --> 00:08:51,005
Hmph... So happy to see
you using that visual jutsu.

96
00:08:51,223 --> 00:08:54,640
Never thought you'd be serious
enough to use Amaterasu like that.

97
00:08:55,215 --> 00:08:58,687
Too bad that visual jutsu
uses up too much chakra.

98
00:08:59,258 --> 00:09:02,797
Won't that hurt your chances when
you go up against Sasuke after this?

99
00:09:06,801 --> 00:09:09,346
Why don't we call it a day...?

100
00:09:10,357 --> 00:09:14,423
Just seeing you like this
is satisfying enough for me.

101
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:17,583
<i>I didn't want to
fight you like this...</i>

102
00:09:22,753 --> 00:09:24,303
Look at you go...

103
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:27,376
I can't remember the
last time I sweated this much.

104
00:09:27,904 --> 00:09:29,876
I want to fight
Sasuke one on one.

105
00:09:30,739 --> 00:09:32,701
Do me a favor and keep
everyone else out of it.

106
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,772
Fair enough. But, still...

107
00:09:38,226 --> 00:09:40,586
It's a little sad
parting with you like this.

108
00:09:40,611 --> 00:09:43,817
After everything
we've been through together.

109
00:09:47,365 --> 00:09:48,574
It's up ahead...

110
00:09:50,689 --> 00:09:54,359
You guys wait for my signal.
I'll scout ahead.

111
00:10:06,382 --> 00:10:07,383
<i>Who's that...?</i>

112
00:10:09,323 --> 00:10:10,532
<i>Sharingan?!</i>

113
00:10:11,816 --> 00:10:12,809
<i>Sasuke?!</i>

114
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:19,676
<i>Th-That's--!</i>

115
00:10:21,761 --> 00:10:23,555
<i>Itachi... Uchiha!</i>

116
00:10:27,499 --> 00:10:30,210
Come on out... Naruto Uzumaki.

117
00:10:34,691 --> 00:10:36,651
You've come to capture me?

118
00:10:37,193 --> 00:10:41,781
No... I didn't.
I just came to talk to you.

119
00:10:48,551 --> 00:10:50,887
Like I'd ever trust you!

120
00:10:54,577 --> 00:10:59,082
I know that you're alone.
So why don't you run?

121
00:10:59,424 --> 00:11:03,261
Hah! I can become a thousand in an instant!

122
00:11:03,343 --> 00:11:05,512
Besides, I can't run away!

123
00:11:06,181 --> 00:11:09,517
If I capture you, I get to see Sasuke!

124
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:14,899
Why are you so attached to my brother?

125
00:11:15,273 --> 00:11:16,650
He's a rogue ninja.

126
00:11:17,728 --> 00:11:19,897
That's because unlike you...

127
00:11:20,445 --> 00:11:23,615
I think of him as a brother
more than you ever would.

128
00:11:38,221 --> 00:11:41,224
<i>You're already under my genjutsu.</i>

129
00:11:42,224 --> 00:11:43,099
Damn it!!

130
00:11:46,385 --> 00:11:47,729
<i>I'll say it again.</i>

131
00:11:47,754 --> 00:11:50,131
<i>I just wanted to talk to you
for a moment.</i>

132
00:11:52,054 --> 00:11:55,409
<i>You've been trying to take
Sasuke back to the village.</i>

133
00:11:56,219 --> 00:11:59,180
<i>But... what if it doesn't
go the way you want?</i>

134
00:12:00,746 --> 00:12:02,435
I'll do anything
to make it happen.

135
00:12:02,926 --> 00:12:04,382
<i>Even by force?</i>

136
00:12:05,234 --> 00:12:09,568
<i>If, by some turn of luck,
Sasuke willingly goes with you, great.</i>

137
00:12:10,235 --> 00:12:12,868
<i>But what if the
exact opposite happens?</i>

138
00:12:13,965 --> 00:12:15,099
What does that mean?

139
00:12:15,492 --> 00:12:16,905
<i>You just said...</i>

140
00:12:17,615 --> 00:12:20,198
<i>you consider Sasuke
to be like a brother...</i>

141
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:24,703
<i>What if Sasuke were
to attack the Leaf village?</i>

142
00:12:24,739 --> 00:12:26,194
<i>What would you do then?</i>

143
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:28,453
What? Why would Sasuke...?

144
00:12:29,341 --> 00:12:31,113
There's no way
he'd do something like that!

145
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:36,456
<i>Sasuke is still naive.
He can easily be dyed any color.</i>

146
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:41,041
<i>In such a case,
could you stop him?</i>

147
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,190
<i>Even if you had to kill him?</i>

148
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:50,649
<i>Can you weigh Sasuke
against the Leaf on a set of scales?</i>

149
00:12:51,694 --> 00:12:52,866
I would defend the Leaf!

150
00:12:53,186 --> 00:12:55,698
But I would stop Sasuke
without killing him!

151
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:58,236
<i>You're such a child...</i>

152
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,695
<i>What you speak of
is nothing but a fantasy.</i>

153
00:13:01,609 --> 00:13:05,304
<i>Shinobi must sometimes
make very harsh decisions.</i>

154
00:13:06,127 --> 00:13:08,705
Someone tried telling
me something similar before...

155
00:13:09,615 --> 00:13:11,220
But for me, there is no choice.

156
00:13:12,293 --> 00:13:14,660
I never go back on my word...

157
00:13:15,526 --> 00:13:17,404
That's my ninja way!

158
00:13:27,443 --> 00:13:29,808
<i>I have shared some of
my power with you.</i>

159
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:31,878
<i>Though...</i>

160
00:13:32,148 --> 00:13:34,406
<i>I hope the day never comes
when you have to use it...</i>

161
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,793
Wh-What's going on?

162
00:13:40,341 --> 00:13:44,519
Aren't you after me?
Then this is your...!

163
00:13:44,544 --> 00:13:45,837
I'm going now...

164
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:49,121
I have an important task to do.

165
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,834
<i>Shadow Clone...</i>

166
00:13:54,646 --> 00:13:56,064
<i>What was that?</i>

167
00:13:57,505 --> 00:13:59,715
Damn! This one's a bust too!

168
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:07,390
What's wrong, Naruto?

169
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:09,183
Oh, nothing...

170
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,197
Did something happen?

171
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:14,810
I just tripped.

172
00:14:15,648 --> 00:14:18,359
Never mind that.
Kiba, track the next scent.

173
00:14:26,911 --> 00:14:28,120
So you've come...

174
00:14:30,347 --> 00:14:31,348
Who's there?!

175
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:36,252
It's me... Sasuke.

176
00:14:39,952 --> 00:14:41,788
You've grown a bit taller.

177
00:14:43,968 --> 00:14:48,306
And you're still the same.
Even those cold eyes...

178
00:14:49,307 --> 00:14:53,561
Not going to scream and attack
like you did before?

179
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,291
You don't know a thing about me...

180
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:14,957
How much hatred I carry inside me...

181
00:15:15,702 --> 00:15:18,705
And how strong I have become
because of that hatred.

182
00:15:22,773 --> 00:15:25,609
You don't know me at all.

183
00:15:47,386 --> 00:15:50,014
You've become... strong.

184
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:02,755
<i>Come to the Uchiha hideout alone.</i>

185
00:16:03,272 --> 00:16:05,774
<i>I'll let you settle things there.</i>

186
00:16:14,854 --> 00:16:15,938
Sasuke!

187
00:16:20,225 --> 00:16:23,645
I told you not to move until
you received orders.

188
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,989
Karin said she sensed another chakra,
so we were worried.

189
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:33,230
Feathers?

190
00:16:38,232 --> 00:16:40,693
Follow me. Let's go!

191
00:16:42,863 --> 00:16:44,949
The same chakra is all over the place!

192
00:16:45,673 --> 00:16:46,674
What's going on?!

193
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,802
Should we change course, Sasuke?

194
00:16:50,401 --> 00:16:53,112
Ignore it. We'll forge straight ahead.

195
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,307
Good. Taking the long way
would've been tiring.

196
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:12,741
Sasuke!

197
00:17:16,266 --> 00:17:17,642
What was that?!

198
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:19,127
A Shadow Clone.

199
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:20,541
Naruto, eh?

200
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,251
<i>What a pest.</i>

201
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:25,970
Multi-Shadow Clones... I get it now...

202
00:17:25,995 --> 00:17:29,373
The same chakra I sense all over
the place belongs to him.

203
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:32,553
Found him!

204
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:37,391
Good job!

205
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:38,934
Which way?!

206
00:17:39,513 --> 00:17:40,514
This way!

207
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:44,398
<i>I'm not letting you get away
this time, Sasuke!</i>

208
00:17:53,788 --> 00:17:54,789
What is this?!

209
00:17:55,201 --> 00:17:58,954
A humongous chakra! And it's fast!
Incoming!

210
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,968
You're...!

211
00:18:13,235 --> 00:18:16,822
Only Sasuke may go beyond this point.

212
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,976
It's Itachi's orders.

213
00:18:21,511 --> 00:18:25,056
The rest of you are welcome
to wait here.

214
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:28,557
All right. Besides, we were only
traveling as a squad

215
00:18:28,582 --> 00:18:32,669
in order to prevent interference
with my showdown...

216
00:18:33,424 --> 00:18:34,258
This will do.

217
00:18:34,283 --> 00:18:36,285
No, you can't, Sasuke!

218
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:38,619
Let's take him down and
go in together!

219
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:42,164
I have no intention of fighting.

220
00:18:42,332 --> 00:18:46,252
But if you insist on going with him,
I will show no mercy.

221
00:18:46,507 --> 00:18:50,636
Karin... Stay put.
This is my vendetta.

222
00:18:59,124 --> 00:19:04,295
Kisame Hoshigaki...
and the great sword, Samehada.

223
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:05,936
Hmm?

224
00:19:06,219 --> 00:19:07,596
Have you forgotten me?

225
00:19:07,621 --> 00:19:11,791
I'm Suigetsu Hozuki,
the younger brother of Mangetsu Hozuki.

226
00:19:12,261 --> 00:19:18,184
Oh... I didn't recognize you!
You've grown, Suigetsu.

227
00:19:18,701 --> 00:19:22,329
I don't want to just wait around
for Sasuke...

228
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:24,409
Will you let me kill some time

229
00:19:24,434 --> 00:19:28,012
and have some fun with you,
Kisame-senpai?!

230
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:32,239
Unlike your brother,
you're quite cocky, aren't you?

231
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:36,135
Maybe I should grind you down a bit.

232
00:19:36,503 --> 00:19:39,798
Suigetsu... Shouldn't we abide
by Sasuke's orders?

233
00:19:40,331 --> 00:19:44,335
<i>Don't be stupid! You blockhead!</i>

234
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:47,344
This way, guys!

235
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:50,524
Wait! Naruto...

236
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:52,651
This chakra...

237
00:19:53,611 --> 00:19:54,862
Howdy!

238
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,541
What the-?!

239
00:19:59,051 --> 00:20:02,471
Well now... How's it going there,
there, and there?

240
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:06,290
Imagine running into the Hidden Leaf
in a place like this...

241
00:20:06,315 --> 00:20:09,068
I mean... It's two, four, six...

242
00:20:09,093 --> 00:20:11,429
Eight against one. Such bad timing.

243
00:20:12,627 --> 00:20:16,005
That robe...
You're a member of the Akatsuki!

244
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:20,594
Though he wasn't on the list
that Kabuto left us.

245
00:20:21,713 --> 00:20:23,507
Oh, I'm a newbie. Nice to meet you.

246
00:20:24,978 --> 00:20:28,565
Hah! Think you're funny?!
Don't waste our time!

247
00:20:29,355 --> 00:20:32,524
Don't be rash. Study the situation first.

248
00:20:33,313 --> 00:20:35,925
Right now, we have him outnumbered.

249
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,615
Oh dear...
Am I being underestimated?

250
00:20:39,657 --> 00:20:40,824
By you guys?

251
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:46,789
So this is an Akatsuki member...

252
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,959
<i>Another weirdo...</i>

253
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:54,588
<i>They keep getting between us and
Sasuke over and over again!</i>

254
00:20:58,554 --> 00:21:00,639
Don't get in our way!

255
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:02,262
A Shadow Clone?!

256
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:08,394
Just kidding...

257
00:21:15,818 --> 00:21:20,096
It seems you're more proficient
with the blade than that kid.

258
00:21:20,121 --> 00:21:21,164
Kid?!

259
00:21:23,153 --> 00:21:24,780
You mean, Zabuza-senpai?

260
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:35,595
My great sword Samehada
wasn't made for dueling, you know!

261
00:21:38,257 --> 00:21:41,260
Same here. This one's...

262
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:44,263
for killing!

263
00:21:48,257 --> 00:21:53,137
Tsk! Have fun? As if!
They're dead serious!

264
00:21:53,684 --> 00:21:55,894
Hey! Jugo... Tell him...

265
00:21:56,442 --> 00:21:59,737
It's okay... The birds are telling me

266
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:02,322
there's no one nearby who will interfere
with their fighting.

267
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:06,784
<i>Honestly... What if something happens
to Sasuke</i>

268
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:08,894
<i>while these idiots are going at it?</i>

269
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:11,790
<i>Even the Hidden Leaf are in pursuit!</i>

270
00:22:13,245 --> 00:22:14,913
<i>The Hidden Leaf have stopped?</i>

271
00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:17,546
You're so full of yourself!

272
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:21,091
Just what can a kid like you do?!

273
00:22:37,037 --> 00:22:38,163
Naruto...

274
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:39,900
<i>Thank goodness...</i>

275
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:40,926
Hinata!

276
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:43,322
Naruto can handle the damage!

277
00:22:45,824 --> 00:22:47,493
Don't take your eyes off the enemy!

278
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,891
Hmm? Are you guys analyzing
my strength right now?

279
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:57,961
The Hidden Leaf are very shrewd...

280
00:22:57,961 --> 00:23:01,278
But for a newbie, I'm pretty good...
don't you think?

281
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:06,053
He's dodged every one
of Naruto's attacks.

282
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,723
He's toying with us.
But what is he after?

283
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,171
Now then... What shall we play,
Hidden Leaf folks?

284
00:23:14,489 --> 00:23:16,991
We don't have time to waste
on the likes of you!

285
00:23:17,475 --> 00:23:18,518
He's right!

286
00:23:18,835 --> 00:23:22,255
That's because we have to go
after Sasuke.

287
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:28,384
Shino, you didn't get to go on
the last mission to retrieve Sasuke!

288
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:30,447
We're counting on you this time!

289
00:23:31,114 --> 00:23:32,866
<i>Our bond, is it?</i>

290
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,789
All right... everyone.
Let's end this quickly.

291
00:23:38,573 --> 00:23:40,825
We'll go with Formation B.

292
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,119
Roger!

293
00:23:43,741 --> 00:23:44,605
- Right!
- Yes sir!

294
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:50,303
Ohh? Seems you're serious.
Well, I'd better get fired up.

295
00:23:51,393 --> 00:23:53,812
You jerk... Quit kidding around!

296
00:23:53,837 --> 00:23:56,464
Naruto, concentrate on the formation!

297
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,277
Yeah, I know.

298
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,063
Let's do it.
Kiba, are you ready on your side?

299
00:24:01,088 --> 00:24:03,424
Anytime. Right, Akamaru?!

300
00:24:05,178 --> 00:24:06,512
Then here goes!

301
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:16,747
Oh my, so high...
That girl has such brute power.

302
00:24:17,008 --> 00:24:21,346
Oops! They distracted me with the decoy...
And now those three are surrounding me!

303
00:24:21,477 --> 00:24:24,439
I don't know which one to dodge!

304
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:26,967
S-Say, that's no fair!

305
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:29,011
- No time for you to look!
- Oh dear...

306
00:24:29,874 --> 00:24:30,862
What...?

307
00:24:31,144 --> 00:24:33,187
Cha! Cha!

308
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:34,793
Olé!

309
00:24:34,935 --> 00:24:37,478
Three against one?!
You Hidden Leaf cowards!

310
00:24:37,503 --> 00:24:38,755
<i>Rasengan!</i>

311
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,241
You weren't the decoy?

312
00:24:41,427 --> 00:24:42,720
You got me...!

313
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:48,822
Not!

314
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,267
<i>Ninja Art: Blockade Jutsu!</i>

315
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:58,661
Honestly... You said you were going
to do it all together...

316
00:24:58,686 --> 00:25:00,354
And I believed you!

317
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:01,919
Don't stop, everyone!

318
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,962
Separate and force your way through!

319
00:25:06,398 --> 00:25:10,151
Accha! Ni-Ni-Ninja Art:
Ai-ai-ai-ai! Mo-!

320
00:25:18,497 --> 00:25:19,956
What kind of jutsu is that?

321
00:25:21,063 --> 00:25:23,690
I got it! I'm going to name this jutsu...

322
00:25:23,715 --> 00:25:26,760
<i>Ninja Art: Whack-A-Mole Jutsu!</i>

323
00:25:26,844 --> 00:25:29,889
Except the roles for
hitting are reversed...

324
00:25:31,191 --> 00:25:32,192
Senpai...

325
00:25:32,757 --> 00:25:33,800
I know...

326
00:25:33,825 --> 00:25:37,871
Unless we finish him off for good,
he won't let us move forward.

327
00:25:39,222 --> 00:25:40,557
Damn it!

328
00:25:41,424 --> 00:25:44,427
Say, say... What shall we play next?

329
00:25:46,273 --> 00:25:49,776
We can't be wasting time
in a place like this!

330
00:25:49,852 --> 00:25:54,481
I know that.
We'll go with Battle Formation A next.

331
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:24,626
My foolish little brother...

332
00:26:27,898 --> 00:26:31,693
That Sharingan...
How much can you actually see?

333
00:26:32,956 --> 00:26:34,707
How much can I see with these?

334
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:39,933
What I'm seeing right now, Itachi...

335
00:26:40,501 --> 00:26:42,252
is your death.

336
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,387
My death, huh?

337
00:26:50,337 --> 00:26:51,338
Well then...

338
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,033
make it happen.

339
00:27:24,433 --> 00:27:25,434
<i>Chidori!</i>

340
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:34,821
<i>Chidori Stream!</i>

341
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:51,588
You've become... strong.

342
00:27:52,348 --> 00:27:56,603
Itachi... I have one last thing to ask...

343
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:32,519
<i>You've become... strong</i>

344
00:28:33,063 --> 00:28:35,774
The same line as before...
and the bird...

345
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:38,593
Another farce with
your special genjutsu?

346
00:28:39,311 --> 00:28:40,729
What do you want to know?

347
00:28:41,861 --> 00:28:44,280
It's not over, but I'll hear you out.

348
00:28:45,245 --> 00:28:46,621
I'll say it once more...

349
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:07,991
Genjutsu...

350
00:29:08,368 --> 00:29:10,787
I have one last thing to ask...

351
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:13,128
That's what I said, you bastard!

352
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:15,828
Answer my question.

353
00:29:16,214 --> 00:29:18,592
That pain in your chest
won't subside until you answer.

354
00:29:19,634 --> 00:29:21,720
So you purposely missed a vital spot...

355
00:29:22,454 --> 00:29:24,206
You said back then...

356
00:29:25,641 --> 00:29:27,456
<i>If you awaken
the Mangekyo Sharingan,</i>

357
00:29:27,481 --> 00:29:31,789
<i>there will be three, including myself,
who possess its powers.</i>

358
00:29:32,355 --> 00:29:33,356
<i>Then...</i>

359
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:36,651
<i>there will be meaning
in letting you live.</i>

360
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:40,780
The third person...
The other one with a Sharingan...

361
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:43,197
Who in the Uchiha Clan is it?

362
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:48,474
Why... the curiosity about such a thing?

363
00:29:49,404 --> 00:29:53,366
I'm going to kill him after you.
That's why.

364
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:56,087
Kill?

365
00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:59,117
When you killed off the entire clan,

366
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,024
you mentioned the existence
of another person.

367
00:30:02,915 --> 00:30:08,463
So that Uchiha member you didn't kill
was a co-conspirator.

368
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:12,812
Even you couldn't have killed the
entire Military Police Force alone.

369
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:16,757
So you figured it out...

370
00:30:17,377 --> 00:30:18,378
Who is it?!

371
00:30:26,021 --> 00:30:28,648
It's Madara Uchiha...

372
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,916
Madara... Uchiha?!

373
00:30:35,961 --> 00:30:38,296
One of the founders of
the Hidden Leaf Village...

374
00:30:39,381 --> 00:30:42,509
The man who first possessed
the Mangekyo Sharingan.

375
00:30:43,102 --> 00:30:44,103
Founder?

376
00:30:45,057 --> 00:30:47,560
Then Madara should be long dead!

377
00:30:48,074 --> 00:30:49,492
Are you making fun of me?!

378
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:52,602
Madara is alive...

379
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:56,167
It's up to you whether you believe
that or not.

380
00:30:56,731 --> 00:30:58,275
Stop joking around!

381
00:30:59,818 --> 00:31:05,699
In order to survive, we cling to
all we know and understand.

382
00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:09,669
And we label it reality.

383
00:31:11,507 --> 00:31:14,760
But knowledge and understanding
are ambiguous.

384
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,585
That reality could be an illusion.

385
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,462
All people live, bound by their
own knowledge and perception.

386
00:31:22,284 --> 00:31:23,827
Isn't that another way
of looking at it?

387
00:31:24,884 --> 00:31:26,636
Just what are you trying to say?

388
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:33,435
It's only your assumption
that Madara is dead.

389
00:31:34,602 --> 00:31:36,104
In exactly the same way

390
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:39,524
you once assumed that
I was your kind older brother.

391
00:31:49,326 --> 00:31:51,119
What happened that night...

392
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:54,956
I was so young and thought
it was all an illusion.

393
00:31:55,623 --> 00:31:58,126
That I was caught in
a cruel genjutsu...

394
00:31:58,257 --> 00:31:59,758
I wanted to believe that.

395
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,381
But that was... unmistakably reality!

396
00:32:07,677 --> 00:32:10,096
My eye is not like it was
in the past!

397
00:32:10,472 --> 00:32:13,058
My Sharingan can see
through genjutsu!

398
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,354
You still speak with such confidence.

399
00:32:18,276 --> 00:32:21,655
But for now, I'll take your word for it.

400
00:32:28,198 --> 00:32:30,867
Why don't we end this little charade?

401
00:32:35,967 --> 00:32:37,385
Being confident is fine.

402
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:42,504
But Sasuke, your eye still isn't
the same as mine.

403
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:48,051
<i>Then one day, come before me with
the same eye that I possess.</i>

404
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:52,764
So... you couldn't kill the friend
who is most dear to you.

405
00:32:53,573 --> 00:32:57,076
And you dared to appear before me
with such weak resolve?

406
00:32:59,437 --> 00:33:03,775
Then hurry and try to kill me
with your Mangekyo Sharingan!

407
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:08,488
Or is it too difficult to test
your capability against me now?

408
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:13,535
You're pretty sure of yourself...

409
00:33:16,413 --> 00:33:19,624
Neither of them has moved
for a while.

410
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:22,836
<i>They're just feeling each other out
with genjutsu.</i>

411
00:33:30,202 --> 00:33:34,373
Mangekyo Sharingan...
This eye is special...

412
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:40,603
From the moment it awakens,
it goes towards the dark.

413
00:33:41,403 --> 00:33:44,281
And the more it is used,
the more it is sealed.

414
00:33:45,092 --> 00:33:46,279
What do you mean?

415
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:50,374
In time, the Mangekyo Sharingan
loses its light.

416
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,923
Blindness...

417
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:56,200
Is that the trade-off for the power
to control the Nine-Tails?

418
00:33:58,541 --> 00:34:02,278
You did as I instructed and read
the stone tablet in the main hall?

419
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:06,754
Madara... Exactly who and what is he?

420
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:10,381
The first one ever to use that eye
to tame the Nine-Tails.

421
00:34:11,526 --> 00:34:15,613
An immortal man who is both
my partner and my mentor...

422
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:22,664
And the only one to uncover the
other secret of the Mangekyo Sharingan.

423
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:26,566
That... is Madara Uchiha.

424
00:34:27,194 --> 00:34:32,269
It has another ocular power aside
from taming the Nine-Tails?

425
00:34:32,911 --> 00:34:38,747
Yes... One more secret.
The most important secret.

426
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:43,625
What is it?! Answer me!

427
00:34:45,432 --> 00:34:47,454
Let me tell you a little
about the past.

428
00:34:48,296 --> 00:34:50,548
It concerns the history
of the Uchiha.

429
00:34:52,342 --> 00:34:56,888
Long ago, Madara had a brother...
A younger brother.

430
00:35:13,321 --> 00:35:15,406
Madara Uchiha and
his younger brother...

431
00:35:16,312 --> 00:35:18,022
From the time they were little,

432
00:35:18,047 --> 00:35:20,550
they honed their skills and
competed with each other.

433
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,327
The Mangekyo Sharingan awakened
in them both...

434
00:35:24,517 --> 00:35:29,188
and in time, they came to stand
at the center of their clan.

435
00:35:31,227 --> 00:35:34,438
Both sought to sharpen
their ocular powers

436
00:35:34,905 --> 00:35:36,261
and competed against each other.

437
00:35:38,101 --> 00:35:41,671
And so, the two brothers...
they killed their closest friends

438
00:35:41,933 --> 00:35:44,811
and finally awakened
the Mangekyo Sharingan.

439
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:53,336
It had never before been seen
among the Uchiha.

440
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:57,646
The brothers used their
ocular powers to take control

441
00:35:58,157 --> 00:36:00,326
and Madara became the leader.

442
00:36:01,654 --> 00:36:04,615
However, a change began to
occur in Madara

443
00:36:04,958 --> 00:36:07,043
whose eyesight had been perfect until then.

444
00:36:07,761 --> 00:36:10,639
As I mentioned earlier,
this eye is special.

445
00:36:11,562 --> 00:36:13,481
The more you use it,
the more your vision is sealed away...

446
00:36:13,756 --> 00:36:16,009
until you end up with total darkness.

447
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:19,685
That is the ultimate fate of
the Mangekyo Sharingan.

448
00:36:20,513 --> 00:36:25,977
The price for such power is that
you extinguish it with your own hands...

449
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:27,437
and lose the light forever.

450
00:36:29,647 --> 00:36:33,401
In order to regain his sight,
Madara tried every means possible...

451
00:36:33,693 --> 00:36:36,321
yet nothing worked.

452
00:36:37,488 --> 00:36:38,781
He was in despair.

453
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:43,995
Madara became obsessed by the
Mangekyo Sharingan and craved the light.

454
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:49,924
Forgive me...

455
00:36:53,796 --> 00:36:57,050
He took both eyes from
his younger brother.

456
00:37:03,102 --> 00:37:05,939
Madara now possessed new light.

457
00:37:06,548 --> 00:37:11,052
And... never again did the light fade
from his eyes.

458
00:37:12,975 --> 00:37:15,102
An eternal Mangekyo Sharingan!

459
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:19,739
It is said that his younger brother's eyes
gained eternal light

460
00:37:19,781 --> 00:37:22,075
when they found a new host...

461
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,315
And it triggered a change.

462
00:37:26,389 --> 00:37:29,350
A new, unique ocular jutsu was born
in those eyes.

463
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:34,955
However, the exchange of eyes can
only be conducted among clan members.

464
00:37:36,085 --> 00:37:39,714
Furthermore, not everyone can attain
new powers from this method.

465
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:46,324
That is the truth of our history,
forged through countless sacrifices.

466
00:37:48,263 --> 00:37:51,183
That is the other secret of this eye...

467
00:37:53,442 --> 00:37:58,322
Madara used his power and took control
of one ninja clan after another.

468
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:03,255
Ultimately, he formed an alliance
with the Senju Clan,

469
00:38:03,324 --> 00:38:05,343
which was touted as
the strongest ninja clan

470
00:38:05,368 --> 00:38:07,537
and established a new organization.

471
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:12,134
Later, he clashed with the leader
of the Senju Clan,

472
00:38:12,363 --> 00:38:15,783
the future First Hokage,
over the course the village would take.

473
00:38:17,024 --> 00:38:19,443
He lost the battle over leadership,

474
00:38:20,051 --> 00:38:23,763
but Madara still lives with
his ocular powers intact.

475
00:38:25,604 --> 00:38:28,190
He formed a new organization
called the Akatsuki

476
00:38:28,322 --> 00:38:30,574
and hides himself in its shadows.

477
00:38:32,334 --> 00:38:33,919
Sixteen years ago,

478
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:37,567
Madara instigated the Nine-Tails' attack
on the Leaf Village.

479
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:41,654
But that too was foiled by
the Fourth Hokage.

480
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,784
Madara is a bitter, defeated loser...

481
00:38:47,497 --> 00:38:51,001
He is not worthy of becoming
the best among the Uchiha.

482
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:55,084
I am the one...

483
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:58,588
who shall surpass Madara and
become the ultimate ninja!

484
00:38:59,395 --> 00:39:03,941
And now... I can finally obtain
a power that exceeds even Madara's!

485
00:39:05,673 --> 00:39:09,969
Sasuke! You are my new light!

486
00:39:11,062 --> 00:39:13,272
You are my spare!

487
00:39:21,169 --> 00:39:24,088
Originally, the Uchiha Clan
killed off friends

488
00:39:24,113 --> 00:39:26,073
in order to possess
Mangekyo Sharingan.

489
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:29,994
Parents and siblings killed one another
to possess eternal ocular power...

490
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:34,545
And they showed off this power...
They are a tainted clan!

491
00:39:35,561 --> 00:39:38,189
And, from the day you were born,

492
00:39:38,214 --> 00:39:41,885
you have been inevitably bound
to this blood-stained fate!

493
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:45,011
Now come! My little brother!

494
00:39:46,093 --> 00:39:49,931
I shall kill you...
and free myself from this fate

495
00:39:49,956 --> 00:39:52,083
and bring about true change!

496
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:57,396
I will be free of the constraints
that bind me!

497
00:39:58,648 --> 00:40:01,567
<i>But, we only have each other
as siblings.</i>

498
00:40:02,425 --> 00:40:04,594
<i>I'm always going to be there for you,</i>

499
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:07,455
<i>even if it's only as an obstacle
for you to overcome.</i>

500
00:40:08,366 --> 00:40:10,868
We are each other's spares!

501
00:40:12,829 --> 00:40:15,456
<i>You've been jealous of me
and resented me.</i>

502
00:40:16,332 --> 00:40:18,960
<i>You've harbored hopes
of surpassing me.</i>

503
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:21,504
<i>That is why I am allowing you to live.</i>

504
00:40:21,529 --> 00:40:22,696
<i>For my sake...</i>

505
00:40:23,063 --> 00:40:26,650
This is the true bond between
the brothers of the Uchiha!

506
00:40:47,481 --> 00:40:49,467
So it was all for this...

507
00:40:52,034 --> 00:40:54,203
<i>My name is Sasuke Uchiha.</i>

508
00:40:54,245 --> 00:40:58,124
<i>There are lots of things I hate.
And not many things I like.</i>

509
00:40:58,775 --> 00:41:02,320
<i>Also... I have no intention
of saying I have a dream.</i>

510
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,963
<i>But I do have ambition!</i>

511
00:41:04,755 --> 00:41:09,468
<i>To restore my clan... and kill...</i>

512
00:41:09,594 --> 00:41:10,887
<i>a certain man.</i>

513
00:41:17,018 --> 00:41:19,395
I've finally arrived...

514
00:41:21,817 --> 00:41:24,111
The moment to fulfill my goal!

515
00:41:27,171 --> 00:41:30,591
You say you can see my death...

516
00:41:31,799 --> 00:41:35,177
But you cannot win against
my Mangekyo Sharingan.

517
00:41:36,409 --> 00:41:39,621
Unfortunately, your ambition
will end as a mere illusion.

518
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:43,794
Because you do not possess
the Mangekyo Sharingan.

519
00:41:59,226 --> 00:42:01,938
You can use your eyes all you like,

520
00:42:02,313 --> 00:42:06,692
but my hatred will make
this illusion a reality!

521
00:42:10,363 --> 00:42:12,281
Your reality...

522
00:42:13,219 --> 00:42:14,220
is death!

523
00:42:45,518 --> 00:42:48,421
<i>He wove signs for a
Shadow Clone mid-attack!</i>

524
00:43:34,657 --> 00:43:35,992
<i>You pierced him with Chidori?!</i>

525
00:44:15,321 --> 00:44:17,406
Forgive me, Sasuke...

526
00:44:30,878 --> 00:44:32,880
This is my reality...

527
00:44:33,714 --> 00:44:35,091
Give me your light.

528
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,072
I told you.

529
00:44:58,781 --> 00:45:01,408
You do not possess
the Mangekyo Sharingan.

530
00:45:01,433 --> 00:45:04,061
You can never win against
my eyes.

531
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:19,633
I’ll take the other one too.

532
00:45:40,109 --> 00:45:42,069
<i>So that is the power of
the Curse Mark...</i>

533
00:45:52,713 --> 00:45:54,799
This is the difference in
our strength.

534
00:45:55,965 --> 00:45:57,049
And...

535
00:45:58,799 --> 00:46:01,552
the difference between
your ocular powers and mine.

536
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:14,541
You broke through... my Tsukuyomi?!

537
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:22,586
Like I told you...

538
00:47:23,212 --> 00:47:25,839
No matter how much you use
those eyes of yours,

539
00:47:26,247 --> 00:47:30,126
my hatred will make this illusion a reality.

540
00:47:31,037 --> 00:47:34,791
Humph... Making illusions a reality...?

541
00:47:37,036 --> 00:47:40,581
Then let me throw those words
right back at you.

542
00:47:43,654 --> 00:47:48,325
You saw your eyes gouged out
during the Tsukuyomi just now.

543
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:52,997
Well, allow me to make that a reality.

544
00:47:55,958 --> 00:47:59,628
<i>The air around Itachi has shifted!</i>

545
00:48:00,129 --> 00:48:02,631
<i>He’s gotten serious.</i>

546
00:48:02,891 --> 00:48:07,562
<i>Which means,
we might get to see the Amaterasu.</i>

547
00:48:07,928 --> 00:48:11,473
<i>What? The Amaterasu?!
I can’t wait to see it!</i>

548
00:48:11,682 --> 00:48:14,977
<i>We were right to come see this,
after all!</i>

549
00:48:46,248 --> 00:48:47,249
<i>A rigged shuriken?!</i>

550
00:48:58,645 --> 00:49:01,315
<i>That last shuriken did the job.</i>

551
00:49:12,242 --> 00:49:13,619
<i>That’s strange...</i>

552
00:49:14,203 --> 00:49:15,245
<i>What is it?</i>

553
00:49:15,496 --> 00:49:20,292
<i>It’s just that Itachi should have been
able to dodge something like that.</i>

554
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:38,435
Backlash from that earlier Tsukuyomi?

555
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,980
I like that.

556
00:49:48,237 --> 00:49:50,280
<i>Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!</i>

557
00:50:37,161 --> 00:50:40,080
<i>Wounds like this won’t slow me down.</i>

558
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:46,211
<i>Phew... We almost got caught in that!</i>

559
00:50:51,592 --> 00:50:53,886
<i>– Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!
– Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!</i>

560
00:51:16,492 --> 00:51:17,618
<i>Amaterasu!</i>

561
00:51:28,378 --> 00:51:30,047
<i>Ohh... There it is!</i>

562
00:51:56,573 --> 00:52:00,827
<i>I-Incredible...
He put out fire with fire.</i>

563
00:52:01,036 --> 00:52:04,957
<i>With that jutsu,
he eyes whatever he wants to burn</i>

564
00:52:05,105 --> 00:52:09,693
<i>and once the target is in focus,
black flames burst forth.</i>

565
00:52:10,128 --> 00:52:12,506
<i>The black flame cannot
be extinguished</i>

566
00:52:12,506 --> 00:52:14,967
<i>until the one it targets
is totally incinerated.</i>

567
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:17,886
<i>Even if the target is also fire.</i>

568
00:53:49,411 --> 00:53:51,204
<i>This is what I’ve been waiting for!</i>

569
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:08,577
<i>Fire Style: Dragon Flame Jutsu!</i>

570
00:54:47,741 --> 00:54:52,746
That Amaterasu earlier seems to have
taken quite a toll on you.

571
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:04,849
This will probably be my last jutsu.

572
00:55:15,418 --> 00:55:18,046
The Sharingan can assess chakra.

573
00:55:21,027 --> 00:55:22,279
Stop bluffing...

574
00:55:23,655 --> 00:55:26,283
I can see that you’re out of chakra.

575
00:55:28,926 --> 00:55:32,748
You used an Orochimaru-style
Substitution Jutsu to evade my Amaterasu.

576
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:36,251
A well-made substitution to deceive,

577
00:55:36,796 --> 00:55:38,923
but it uses an enormous amount
of chakra.

578
00:55:43,728 --> 00:55:47,523
You’re right.
I don’t have any chakra left.

579
00:55:48,488 --> 00:55:51,950
I used it up in that
last Fire Style Jutsu.

580
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:58,581
However...

581
00:55:59,065 --> 00:56:03,653
Do you really think I would
come here to kill you unprepared?

582
00:56:07,612 --> 00:56:08,822
It will be instantaneous.

583
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:11,681
This jutsu is just like Amaterasu.

584
00:56:12,193 --> 00:56:14,362
It is impossible to dodge.

585
00:56:16,499 --> 00:56:19,711
Now...
As you wished, I’ll recreate...

586
00:56:22,509 --> 00:56:24,344
your death!

587
00:56:39,018 --> 00:56:40,270
<i>I get it!</i>

588
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,859
<i>That's what Sasuke's Fire Style Jutsu
was for earlier!</i>

589
00:56:42,943 --> 00:56:44,236
What do you mean?

590
00:56:44,569 --> 00:56:50,242
<i>The target of that Fire Style attack was
never Itachi to begin with!</i>

591
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:52,536
So what does that mean?

592
00:56:52,619 --> 00:56:55,539
<i>He purposely released
his Fire Style attack into the sky,</i>

593
00:56:55,773 --> 00:56:58,350
<i>causing a sudden warmth
in the atmosphere</i>

594
00:56:58,375 --> 00:57:01,336
<i>and he created an ascending air current!</i>

595
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:03,151
Ascending air current?

596
00:57:03,391 --> 00:57:08,771
<i>To form cumulonimbus...
In other words, thunderclouds!</i>

597
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:11,402
So what does that mean?

598
00:57:11,538 --> 00:57:14,207
<i>Instead of using his own chakra...</i>

599
00:57:14,335 --> 00:57:17,547
<i>he intends to take advantage of
the massive energy in the atmosphere</i>

600
00:57:17,572 --> 00:57:20,158
<i>to create a Lightning Style Jutsu!</i>

601
00:57:20,255 --> 00:57:21,256
What kind?

602
00:57:21,411 --> 00:57:23,955
<i>In any case, it'll be on
a totally different scale</i>

603
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:27,567
<i>than what anyone can create
using change in chakra Nature alone.</i>

604
00:57:36,442 --> 00:57:37,527
<i>I see...</i>

605
00:57:37,792 --> 00:57:40,628
<i>Sasuke purposely lured Itachi outside,</i>

606
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:43,503
<i>so he could also use the heat
created by Amaterasu.</i>

607
00:57:44,193 --> 00:57:47,112
This jutsu brings down thunder
from the heavens.

608
00:57:47,308 --> 00:57:50,770
I merely direct its power toward you.

609
00:57:51,052 --> 00:57:55,140
<i>Just as I thought...
Which is why it cannot be evaded.</i>

610
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:56,600
Why not?!

611
00:57:56,892 --> 00:57:59,269
<i>A bolt of lightning is
1/1000th of a second.</i>

612
00:57:59,311 --> 00:58:00,770
<i>It's faster than sound!</i>

613
00:58:02,647 --> 00:58:04,482
The name of this jutsu is Kirin.

614
00:58:08,534 --> 00:58:09,535
Come!

615
00:58:20,248 --> 00:58:22,584
Vanish with the roar of thunder...

616
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:06,753
It's... over.

617
00:59:09,065 --> 00:59:10,275
It's over!

618
00:59:15,113 --> 00:59:19,242
<i>Is this... the death you
wanted to recreate?</i>

619
00:59:39,642 --> 00:59:41,018
Damn you!

620
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:42,223
<i>That's...!</i>

621
00:59:53,218 --> 00:59:55,762
Without this, I would have been dead.

622
00:59:56,511 --> 00:59:57,762
<i>What is that?!</i>

623
00:59:58,944 --> 01:00:01,822
You really have... gotten stronger...

624
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:04,017
Sasuke.

625
01:00:08,356 --> 01:00:12,819
This time...
I shall show you my final trump card...

626
01:00:13,737 --> 01:00:15,030
The Susano'o.

627
01:00:16,573 --> 01:00:17,949
Susano'o?

628
01:00:18,283 --> 01:00:20,702
Tsukuyomi and Amaterasu...

629
01:00:21,202 --> 01:00:23,288
When these two powers awakened,

630
01:00:23,313 --> 01:00:26,150
one more jutsu took root in my eyes.

631
01:00:26,943 --> 01:00:29,905
Sasuke, is that it for your jutsu?

632
01:00:31,129 --> 01:00:34,966
If you are hiding another power,
don't hold back.

633
01:00:35,955 --> 01:00:37,915
The real battle is only beginning.

634
01:00:40,513 --> 01:00:42,307
The sky is clearing...

635
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:46,564
<i>It seems that last jutsu is limited
to one shot.</i>

636
01:01:05,243 --> 01:01:06,661
What's the matter?

637
01:01:07,024 --> 01:01:09,401
Have you used up your chakra
and run out of options?

638
01:01:09,626 --> 01:01:10,919
What?!

639
01:01:11,891 --> 01:01:13,559
<i>I can give it to you...</i>

640
01:01:15,215 --> 01:01:18,218
<i>I can lend you power...</i>

641
01:01:18,248 --> 01:01:19,249
Damn it!

642
01:01:20,053 --> 01:01:23,348
<i>You need me, don't you, Sasuke?</i>

643
01:01:24,641 --> 01:01:27,519
<i>I thought you were going to
get revenge on Itachi?</i>

644
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:31,353
<i>Now, release my power!</i>

645
01:01:31,608 --> 01:01:34,527
<i>Then your wish...</i>

646
01:01:57,048 --> 01:01:58,800
Judging by the feel of it...

647
01:01:58,842 --> 01:02:00,927
This is Orochimaru's
Eight-Headed Serpent Jutsu.

648
01:02:56,065 --> 01:02:58,109
Finally, it comes out...

649
01:03:07,243 --> 01:03:10,663
This is it!
This is what I have been waiting for!

650
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:15,774
Thanks to you, the chakra Sasuke
was using to suppress me is gone!

651
01:03:16,294 --> 01:03:19,923
Now is my chance to take over
this boy's body!

652
01:03:20,163 --> 01:03:21,164
And...!

653
01:03:27,538 --> 01:03:32,376
You think I can be beaten
with that level of attack?

654
01:03:33,969 --> 01:03:37,223
Now then, Sasuke...
What will you do next?

655
01:03:37,892 --> 01:03:40,144
This sword! It can't be...!

656
01:03:40,169 --> 01:03:41,587
The Totsuka Blade?!

657
01:03:41,903 --> 01:03:45,198
Itachi... You had it hidden
in your possession...?!

658
01:03:46,407 --> 01:03:48,034
What is that sword anyway?

659
01:03:48,076 --> 01:03:52,330
<i>The Sword of Totsuka, also known
as the Sakegari Longsword,</i>

660
01:03:52,372 --> 01:03:54,040
<i>is a sword of sealing.</i>

661
01:03:54,332 --> 01:03:57,460
<i>It is said to trap and seal away
those it pierces</i>

662
01:03:57,485 --> 01:04:01,280
<i>in a genjutsu world of drunken stupor
for all eternity.</i>

663
01:04:01,506 --> 01:04:05,009
<i>The blade itself is imbued with
a Sealing Jutsu</i>

664
01:04:05,051 --> 01:04:07,470
<i>and is a variant of the Snake Sword.</i>

665
01:04:07,595 --> 01:04:10,390
<i>Orochimaru has long searched for it.</i>

666
01:04:10,415 --> 01:04:13,293
Itachi's power really is immense!

667
01:04:13,612 --> 01:04:15,865
This is it... Sasuke.

668
01:04:28,494 --> 01:04:32,081
Now... your eyes are mine.

669
01:04:32,854 --> 01:04:34,939
I will take my time retrieving them.

670
01:05:32,015 --> 01:05:33,057
Damn it!

671
01:05:47,376 --> 01:05:49,879
That jutsu he called Susano'o...

672
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:52,949
Its shield is repelling every attack!

673
01:05:53,534 --> 01:05:55,203
<i>There's no mistake about it...</i>

674
01:05:55,228 --> 01:05:57,272
<i>That is also a spirit weapon.</i>

675
01:05:57,353 --> 01:06:01,441
<i>It's called the Yata Mirror and
is said to deflect all things.</i>

676
01:06:01,542 --> 01:06:06,339
<i>Combined with the Totsuka Blade
for attacks, he's invincible.</i>

677
01:06:07,002 --> 01:06:10,463
They're my eyes... Mine...

678
01:08:15,451 --> 01:08:18,746
No way?! Itachi is...

679
01:08:18,888 --> 01:08:20,348
Itachi is dead?

680
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:33,236
He was so close to getting
Sasuke's eyes too...

681
01:09:20,333 --> 01:09:21,376
Let's go, Akamaru!

682
01:09:25,746 --> 01:09:26,998
- Yamato!
- Yes sir!

683
01:09:39,802 --> 01:09:41,012
<i>Fang Over Fang!</i>

684
01:09:47,602 --> 01:09:48,728
<i>Rasengan!</i>

685
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:52,440
What?!

686
01:09:58,245 --> 01:09:59,246
You're mine!

687
01:09:59,488 --> 01:10:01,365
Huh?! Whoa! What?!

688
01:10:03,159 --> 01:10:04,744
I-I can't breathe...

689
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:06,370
I'm keeping you restrained like that!

690
01:10:09,498 --> 01:10:11,000
Impossible!

691
01:10:12,335 --> 01:10:15,254
I'm really flexible, you see?

692
01:10:15,713 --> 01:10:17,089
Now to fight back!

693
01:10:17,294 --> 01:10:18,295
<i>Hidden Jutsu:</i>

694
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:20,700
Retreat! Naruto! Kiba!

695
01:10:23,638 --> 01:10:25,264
<i>Frill-Necked Lizard!</i>

696
01:10:32,136 --> 01:10:34,556
That's all there is to this jutsu.

697
01:10:34,742 --> 01:10:36,286
He's toying with us...

698
01:10:37,109 --> 01:10:38,819
This formation didn't work either.

699
01:10:39,445 --> 01:10:41,656
He skillfully dodged all of our attacks.

700
01:10:42,365 --> 01:10:43,366
Kakashi-sensei...

701
01:10:43,574 --> 01:10:45,326
Yeah... I know.

702
01:10:47,157 --> 01:10:52,246
Naruto... Our formation attack
was timed perfectly, right?

703
01:10:52,463 --> 01:10:53,422
Yeah...

704
01:10:53,588 --> 01:10:58,259
He should have taken a direct hit!
So how was he able to evade it?!

705
01:11:00,549 --> 01:11:02,176
We probably did hit him.

706
01:11:02,343 --> 01:11:03,344
Huh?

707
01:11:03,554 --> 01:11:06,891
It was the same when I first
attacked him with my Rasengan.

708
01:11:12,978 --> 01:11:14,438
I was sure I hit him...

709
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:20,180
In other words, he made it look like
he evaded it, when in actuality;

710
01:11:20,649 --> 01:11:24,027
he allowed you and your jutsu
to slip right through his body.

711
01:11:24,769 --> 01:11:26,145
Is that what you're saying, Naruto?

712
01:11:26,390 --> 01:11:29,393
Humph... Huh...

713
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:33,142
Seriously, Shino! It's hard to follow
what you're trying to say!

714
01:11:33,582 --> 01:11:35,084
Maybe it's a clone...

715
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:39,310
or some sort of genjutsu that makes
you see illusions or visions?

716
01:11:39,614 --> 01:11:43,952
I-I thought so too,
so I used my Byakugan

717
01:11:44,241 --> 01:11:46,785
to increase my field of vision
and checked the chakra.

718
01:11:47,012 --> 01:11:50,685
The only chakra I detected is
the one where he is.

719
01:11:51,290 --> 01:11:52,541
There we go!

720
01:11:53,981 --> 01:11:56,275
<i>Slipped through... No wonder...</i>

721
01:11:57,119 --> 01:11:59,371
Kakashi-senpai...
What do you think?

722
01:11:59,752 --> 01:12:00,919
No doubt about it.

723
01:12:01,068 --> 01:12:03,946
That's some unique jutsu
only he possesses.

724
01:12:04,447 --> 01:12:06,323
Which makes it a real bother, but...

725
01:12:06,608 --> 01:12:07,609
Shino...

726
01:12:07,828 --> 01:12:08,829
I know.

727
01:12:11,874 --> 01:12:13,548
<i>For this type of situation,</i>

728
01:12:13,573 --> 01:12:15,575
<i>someone like Shino who uses
Hidden Jutsu is useful.</i>

729
01:12:15,781 --> 01:12:18,700
Whoa! You're from the Aburame clan!

730
01:12:18,985 --> 01:12:21,279
Man, all wiggly and gross!

731
01:12:21,542 --> 01:12:24,628
Heh! Shino!
You look eager for a change!

732
01:12:24,925 --> 01:12:26,010
Of course.

733
01:12:26,427 --> 01:12:31,515
That's because I was left out of
that last Sasuke rescue mission.

734
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:33,011
Go!

735
01:12:33,726 --> 01:12:35,561
Gross, I tell ya!

736
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:38,437
Disperse!

737
01:12:43,319 --> 01:12:46,113
<i>Is he dodging or
just slipping through?</i>

738
01:12:46,697 --> 01:12:48,491
<i>I'll figure out his jutsu!</i>

739
01:12:49,009 --> 01:12:49,834
Do it!

740
01:12:49,858 --> 01:12:51,553
<i>Hidden Jutsu: Insect Sphere!</i>

741
01:12:52,286 --> 01:12:53,287
Wait a sec!

742
01:12:58,637 --> 01:12:59,846
Well, Hinata?

743
01:13:00,125 --> 01:13:03,962
Y-Yes! I'm able to detect
the target's chakra.

744
01:13:04,595 --> 01:13:07,848
He is definitely inside the swarm
of Shino's insects.

745
01:13:08,270 --> 01:13:09,688
- Yamato!
- Right!

746
01:13:17,349 --> 01:13:18,517
<i>What's going on?</i>

747
01:13:22,556 --> 01:13:24,725
My insects,
which were reacting to his chakra,

748
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:26,335
have suddenly lost him.

749
01:13:26,879 --> 01:13:27,880
This is impossible...

750
01:13:28,278 --> 01:13:29,655
Teleportation Jutsu?

751
01:13:30,241 --> 01:13:32,409
No, it wasn't teleportation.

752
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:35,371
Because if it was teleportation,

753
01:13:35,412 --> 01:13:39,250
my insects would respond
and follow in his direction.

754
01:13:40,152 --> 01:13:41,320
They wouldn't let him escape.

755
01:13:41,939 --> 01:13:45,359
<i>Then he used Space-Time Ninjutsu?</i>

756
01:13:45,787 --> 01:13:48,373
<i>No... that's impossible.</i>

757
01:13:48,997 --> 01:13:53,084
But he... suddenly... just vanished.

758
01:13:54,087 --> 01:13:55,422
<i>He traveled through space</i>

759
01:13:55,447 --> 01:13:58,700
<i>without weaving signs,
summoning, or using marks?</i>

760
01:13:59,194 --> 01:14:02,697
<i>That's a Space-Time Ninjutsu that
far surpasses the Fourth Hokage's!</i>

761
01:14:02,982 --> 01:14:07,778
He erased his entire body.
Can he erase his very presence at will?

762
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:09,000
No way...

763
01:14:09,613 --> 01:14:14,118
But if we accept the fact that
he can erase his existence at will,

764
01:14:14,802 --> 01:14:18,222
then it follows that he can also erase
just a part of his body as well.

765
01:14:18,763 --> 01:14:21,375
Which explains why
a part of his body,

766
01:14:21,375 --> 01:14:24,336
which should have been hit by
an external attack, disappeared.

767
01:14:24,879 --> 01:14:27,590
And to us, it would look like
the attack went right through him.

768
01:14:27,965 --> 01:14:30,634
So he didn't evade the attacks,

769
01:14:30,676 --> 01:14:33,137
they really were slipping right
through him.

770
01:14:37,576 --> 01:14:38,577
I found him!

771
01:14:38,696 --> 01:14:39,697
Over there!

772
01:14:41,288 --> 01:14:43,207
Oh! Hello, hello.

773
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:48,689
Don't think you can escape
my nose!

774
01:14:52,404 --> 01:14:53,405
<i>Tunneling Fang!</i>

775
01:14:57,574 --> 01:15:00,118
Hey, Kiba! Don't be reckless!

776
01:15:00,416 --> 01:15:04,253
Did he slip away again? Damn!

777
01:15:05,118 --> 01:15:08,371
Kiba... I think this time,
he simply dodged.

778
01:15:18,079 --> 01:15:19,080
How did it go?

779
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,502
<i>It's over.</i>

780
01:15:21,987 --> 01:15:23,363
What... is that?

781
01:15:24,302 --> 01:15:27,097
He was on the Akatsuki roster
Kabuto left us with.

782
01:15:27,828 --> 01:15:29,621
We keep getting interference!

783
01:15:30,333 --> 01:15:34,463
Sasuke has won.
Itachi Uchiha is dead.

784
01:15:38,035 --> 01:15:40,746
What?! I don't believe it!

785
01:15:41,121 --> 01:15:42,456
Just kidding...

786
01:15:42,543 --> 01:15:44,169
It's as I expected.

787
01:15:45,228 --> 01:15:48,439
S-Sasuke... killed... Itachi?

788
01:15:49,173 --> 01:15:52,927
Sasuke's down too, but...
I wonder how he is?

789
01:15:53,074 --> 01:15:55,243
He's in pretty bad shape.

790
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:02,501
Hey! You there, spiky aloe guy!

791
01:16:02,903 --> 01:16:04,571
Where's Sasuke now?!

792
01:16:04,728 --> 01:16:06,313
Aloe?!

793
01:16:06,355 --> 01:16:07,731
<i>Don't bother with him.</i>

794
01:16:14,655 --> 01:16:17,616
I'll take you on another time.

795
01:16:19,743 --> 01:16:21,745
That's... a Sharingan?!

796
01:16:27,728 --> 01:16:30,230
Who... in the world is he?!

797
01:16:37,928 --> 01:16:39,013
Later.

798
01:16:49,833 --> 01:16:51,960
We must find Sasuke
before they do!

799
01:17:01,352 --> 01:17:03,520
Hinata! Check in the direction
of four o'clock.

800
01:17:03,912 --> 01:17:05,205
Y-Yes, sir!

801
01:17:06,415 --> 01:17:07,107
<i>Byakugan!</i>

802
01:17:11,503 --> 01:17:13,663
I can see a powerful
chakra across a wide area

803
01:17:13,688 --> 01:17:15,807
about ten kilometers ahead.

804
01:17:16,508 --> 01:17:20,679
Also... for some reason...
the forest is burning...

805
01:17:20,704 --> 01:17:22,622
from black flames.

806
01:17:22,973 --> 01:17:24,349
<i>Amaterasu?!</i>

807
01:17:24,641 --> 01:17:27,227
That's it!
Everyone, follow me!

808
01:17:28,485 --> 01:17:29,486
<i>This time for sure!</i>

809
01:17:31,117 --> 01:17:32,994
Full speed ahead!

810
01:17:49,306 --> 01:17:50,599
You're late.

811
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:55,881
Unlike you, I'm not that fast.

812
01:17:56,715 --> 01:17:59,802
If you were watching,
you better have recorded all of it.

813
01:18:00,385 --> 01:18:04,014
<i>Relax. Everything is recorded.</i>

814
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:07,101
I'll take a good look later.

815
01:18:08,143 --> 01:18:11,980
We're taking Itachi's corpse too.
We should go now.

816
01:18:13,607 --> 01:18:14,858
I detected their scents.

817
01:18:15,317 --> 01:18:17,820
They've already reached
where Sasuke is.

818
01:18:17,986 --> 01:18:19,196
Damn them!

819
01:18:21,194 --> 01:18:24,114
<i>So this is Amaterasu...
I've never seen it before!</i>

820
01:18:24,518 --> 01:18:25,853
What is that?

821
01:18:26,161 --> 01:18:29,081
That is Itachi's jutsu!

822
01:18:29,786 --> 01:18:30,871
Be careful!

823
01:18:30,958 --> 01:18:34,294
That fire will not go out until it
completely incinerates anything it ignites.

824
01:18:34,784 --> 01:18:35,535
Yamato!

825
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:36,561
Yes, Senpai!

826
01:18:37,214 --> 01:18:39,174
<i>Earth Style: Planet Splitter!</i>

827
01:18:55,149 --> 01:18:56,650
Please proceed!

828
01:18:56,859 --> 01:18:59,403
Right! Everyone, except Yamato,
follow me!

829
01:19:07,157 --> 01:19:10,994
<i>Quit wasting time.</i>

830
01:19:11,331 --> 01:19:12,624
You're...

831
01:19:13,469 --> 01:19:14,470
Zetsu.

832
01:19:14,751 --> 01:19:17,421
Tsk. We're not wasting time.

833
01:19:18,014 --> 01:19:20,225
So it's over?

834
01:19:20,796 --> 01:19:23,340
Yeah, it's settled.

835
01:19:26,597 --> 01:19:27,598
What about Sasuke?

836
01:19:28,099 --> 01:19:31,060
He's okay. Sasuke won.

837
01:19:33,103 --> 01:19:35,272
And... where's Sasuke?

838
01:19:35,564 --> 01:19:39,109
<i>He's already been evacuated
to a safe place.</i>

839
01:19:39,610 --> 01:19:40,944
Safe place?

840
01:19:41,445 --> 01:19:46,491
<i>Akatsuki's hideout in the east.
You should head there too.</i>

841
01:19:46,575 --> 01:19:50,829
<i>The Hidden Leaf will come here
very shortly.</i>

842
01:19:51,192 --> 01:19:53,403
Let's go... to where Sasuke is!

843
01:19:54,249 --> 01:19:56,919
<i>What will you do, Kisame?</i>

844
01:19:57,419 --> 01:20:02,299
With Itachi gone, I suppose
I'll be on my own for a while.

845
01:20:02,966 --> 01:20:05,594
I see... Do as you please.

846
01:20:14,004 --> 01:20:17,643
I can still smell a faint trail, but...

847
01:20:18,148 --> 01:20:19,191
We were too late...

848
01:20:22,945 --> 01:20:23,946
Naruto...

849
01:20:26,716 --> 01:20:27,676
Why?

850
01:20:32,788 --> 01:20:37,125
Why can't I ever reach Sasuke?
