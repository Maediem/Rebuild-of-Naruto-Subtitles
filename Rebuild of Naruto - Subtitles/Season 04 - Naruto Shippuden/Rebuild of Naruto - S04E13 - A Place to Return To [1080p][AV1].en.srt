1
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:36,346
I was totally useless...

2
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,266
In fact, I was just in the way...

3
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,394
Lee, you're always so positive.
Once you work up a sweat,

4
00:01:43,419 --> 00:01:45,588
you can forget about
all the negative stuff, can't you?

5
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,358
I'm just not like that...

6
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,693
This is not sweat.

7
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:52,585
These are tears of frustration!

8
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:57,701
This time, at least, I wanted to be useful
and I had prepared so thoroughly for it!

9
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:01,955
I-I know how you feel.
I wanted to be useful too...

10
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,500
Kakashi-sensei!

11
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,377
- Na-!
- Where's Naruto?!

12
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:11,423
That's...

13
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,383
Who's that boy?

14
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:17,303
Probably... the one who can control
the Three-Tails...

15
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,806
He's the one with that special power.

16
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,696
<i>The Three-Tails has disappeared
into the lake,</i>

17
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,573
<i>but this isn't over by any means.</i>

18
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,367
<i>We'll wait for the Sealing Team
to recover,</i>

19
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,786
<i>and then we'll attempt the
Four-Corner Sealing Barrier again.</i>

20
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:43,205
<i>However...</i>

21
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,457
<i>we can't move this boy right now.</i>

22
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,210
<i>When he regains consciousness,</i>

23
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,904
<i>we'll move to a safer spot
and make preparations.</i>

24
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,590
<i>Meanwhile, we need to find Naruto.</i>

25
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:55,926
<i>Naruto...</i>

26
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,595
<i>Don't worry.</i>

27
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,873
<i>Knowing Naruto, he's probably in
the lake doing the breaststroke.</i>

28
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,936
<i>Yamato, Sai, Kiba, Hinata...</i>

29
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:10,440
<i>And me.
The five of us will search for Naruto.</i>

30
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:16,781
<i>Shizune, you come with us
just in case Naruto is injured.</i>

31
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,202
<i>Right.</i>

32
00:03:18,507 --> 00:03:21,218
<i>Sakura and Ino will treat the boy.</i>

33
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,746
<i>The rest of you will keep guard.</i>

34
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:28,167
<i>The enemy is sure to return
to reclaim the boy.</i>

35
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:32,337
<i>I won't let them!
I will protect the boy, no matter what!</i>

36
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,174
<i>Everyone, stay alert and
carry out your mission!</i>

37
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,310
<i>Byakugan!</i>

38
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,360
Naruto...

39
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:07,872
What if we can't find Naruto,
even with Hinata and Kiba with us?

40
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:15,880
Listen. I know we just tried to seal the
Three-Tails and it's totally exhausting,

41
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:18,426
but we have to be extremely careful
with our chakra control.

42
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,052
I know. I'll redeem myself this time.

43
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,723
I'm absolutely going...
to save this boy.

44
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:33,147
Well then, the least I can do is make sure
your chakra control goes well,

45
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,732
and do some inspirational squats...!

46
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:35,776
I can't concentrate!

47
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:38,070
Okay.

48
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,571
We're supposed to be guarding them.

49
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,324
Th-That's right!

50
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,784
It's not smart to stay clustered together.

51
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:49,497
Shino is here.
Let's go around the back.

52
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,624
What about... me?!

53
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,459
You keep watch from the roof.

54
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:54,585
Got it!

55
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,342
The insects are drastically weakened...

56
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,929
Is this also due to
the Three-Tails' chakra?

57
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,414
Where is this...?

58
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:37,211
I know! I was swallowed by
that Three-Tails!

59
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:40,591
Which means I'm inside its belly...!

60
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,843
It's so hard!

61
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:47,889
Seriously, its stomach is awful!
What does it eat anyway?

62
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,142
Oh... me...

63
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:04,573
You're...!

64
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,409
Why you--!

65
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,623
I won't let you have Yuukimaru!

66
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,753
- Yuukimaru is...!
- Die!

67
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:30,598
Rinji!

68
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,268
Why you-! What's going on?!

69
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,686
Ditching us in the middle of a fight!

70
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,607
We went through hell thanks to you!

71
00:06:39,195 --> 00:06:45,201
Now, now. I got an urgent summons
from Guren, so I had no choice.

72
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:51,460
Huh? Wh-What?!

73
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,250
Why you--!

74
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,585
Wh-What?!

75
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:06,886
It's rude to stare like that!

76
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:11,639
Humph... Things change every second
on the battlefield.

77
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,307
H-Hey!

78
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,935
Quit complaining.

79
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,229
Where are you going?

80
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:18,688
Rinji...!

81
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,111
Isn't he... acting strange? That Rinji.

82
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:29,365
He's lost it. Running away
in the face of the enemy.

83
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,410
Who ran away from the enemy?

84
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,537
Uh... no... Well...

85
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,210
Seriously... Quit staring.

86
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,090
You and Rinji... What's with you?

87
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:52,472
Have you ever looked at
your eyes in the mirror?

88
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,434
They're not eyes that look at humans.

89
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,314
At this rate, you guys will die.

90
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,734
A-Are we that bad?!

91
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:05,902
Liar!

92
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,278
No! You're just kidding...

93
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,489
I'm not kidding.

94
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:09,822
You're not?

95
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:11,658
The flow of chakra is all over the place...

96
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:16,412
In your case, I'd say you're heading
straight for self-destruction.

97
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,831
Self-destruction?

98
00:08:19,188 --> 00:08:22,817
My, my.
You fought against a terrifying foe...

99
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:25,965
You, Kihou... In your case,

100
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:31,010
I'd say... you have less
than two hours left and then... boom!

101
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,724
Are you serious?!
What about me? Am I...?

102
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,144
Stop! I don't want to know
how I'm going to die!

103
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:45,233
I-I don't want to die!
Please save me, Kabuto!

104
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,736
M-Me too! Please save me!

105
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,197
I don't want to go! No!

106
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,324
No matter how much you beg,

107
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,577
there are things I can and
can't do with my medical ninjutsu...

108
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:57,746
Ah...

109
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:58,829
- Huh?!
- Huh?!

110
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,540
No... No, I can't.

111
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,377
I can't do such a thing
to my precious comrades!

112
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:04,585
"Such a thing"?!

113
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,213
Please do "such a thing" to us!

114
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:10,174
We'll do anything.
We'll endure anything!

115
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:11,802
I don't want to go "boom"!

116
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,600
Well, since you insist...

117
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:18,616
- Huh?
- Huh?

118
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:35,117
<i>He's being used. He believes
there's someone he can return to...</i>

119
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:37,036
<i>But he's sure to be betrayed.</i>

120
00:09:38,822 --> 00:09:40,449
<i>When that happens...</i>

121
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:43,709
<i>He won't have anywhere to go...</i>

122
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,213
<i>If wherever someone thinks of you
is the place you return to...</i>

123
00:09:48,227 --> 00:09:49,269
<i>Then...</i>

124
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,342
<i>I'll keep thinking of him.</i>

125
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,262
So Naruto was talking about this boy...

126
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:57,444
Huh?

127
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:58,528
Oh...!

128
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,936
Naruto is okay. I'm sure he's somewhere
thinking about this boy...

129
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,941
Where am I?

130
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:13,279
It's okay. We're going to protect you
from now on.

131
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:14,905
Protect...?

132
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,367
It's gone! It's gone!

133
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,535
What's wrong?

134
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,829
Is something missing?

135
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,290
It's gone...!

136
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,132
Gone...!

137
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,798
Gone... Gone...!

138
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:37,012
<i>This is...</i>

139
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:41,517
<i>That's...</i>

140
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:42,933
<i>Yuukimaru...?</i>

141
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,188
<i>Then... Then... you're...</i>

142
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:56,906
<i>I...</i>

143
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,410
<i>I'm forgiven?</i>

144
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,288
<i>Have you...</i>

145
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:09,503
<i>You have the gall to ask such a thing
after killing someone...</i>

146
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,422
<i>Forgive you...?</i>

147
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,465
<i>No...!</i>

148
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:17,720
<i>Absolutely not!</i>

149
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:27,603
<i>Stop... Please stop...!</i>

150
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,398
I...

151
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,120
My wound...

152
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:46,415
Did you treat it?

153
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:50,126
What's the big idea?
What are you scheming?!

154
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:51,669
Nothing...!

155
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,254
Don't lie!

156
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,424
Your enemy lies unconscious!

157
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,259
Why would you, a ninja,
pass up the chance to...!

158
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:02,638
I wouldn't do a shameful thing like hurting
someone who's unable to fight!

159
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:05,893
Where's Yuukimaru?!

160
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:08,521
He's not close by.

161
00:12:08,985 --> 00:12:12,614
Back then, I think we were the only two
that Three-Tails swallowed.

162
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,893
Then Yuukimaru is still by the lake...

163
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,702
Either your people got him...

164
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,247
or one of my comrades saved him.

165
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:34,504
Then I have to get out of here
immediately and find out.

166
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:38,217
So it's imperative that we fight.

167
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:40,886
I'm going to defeat you
and get out of here.

168
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:45,850
You won't leave here...
unless you can defeat me.

169
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:50,144
That's true...
I was just thinking the same thing...

170
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:52,563
But...

171
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:58,404
Huh?

172
00:12:58,418 --> 00:13:00,087
Wh-What...?

173
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:03,200
Huge bugs...?!

174
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,702
They're... miniature Three-Tails!

175
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,834
Argh!

176
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,961
What are you doing?!

177
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,263
I'll use my Crystal Style...!

178
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,433
You can't! Remember?
Not with that injury!

179
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,143
Let go!

180
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,729
I can run by myself!

181
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:41,614
It's gone...! Gone!

182
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,449
What's the matter?
What are you looking for?

183
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,540
Found it! I found it!

184
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,064
See!

185
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,421
It's a pretty crystal...

186
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,297
It's not even scratched...

187
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,467
I'm so glad. Guren is all right.

188
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,219
Guren...?

189
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:10,059
<i>Could it be the person Naruto spoke of,
the one this boy thinks of?</i>

190
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:12,478
Oh...!

191
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:13,896
Are you all right?!

192
00:14:14,358 --> 00:14:16,318
Guren is all right.

193
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,359
This boy... What's with...

194
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:25,616
<i>He's being used.</i>

195
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:29,328
<i>He believes there's someone
he can return to...</i>

196
00:14:29,753 --> 00:14:31,266
<i>But he's sure to be betrayed.</i>

197
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:50,682
Are you all right?

198
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:54,651
Why?

199
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,733
Why are you trying to help me?

200
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:03,403
I don't fight an injured enemy...

201
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:06,864
You could've left me for
those Three-Tails back there...

202
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,366
That would've been disgusting to watch!

203
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,286
You're... naïve...

204
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:13,996
Humph!

205
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:17,376
Had it been me, you'd be dead by now.

206
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:21,086
And I'd leave this place...
and look for Yuukimaru.

207
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,756
You want Yuukimaru that badly?

208
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,258
For Orochimaru's sake?!

209
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:31,390
Well, what about you guys?

210
00:15:31,417 --> 00:15:34,796
You discovered Yuukimaru's power
and now you want him for yourselves!

211
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:38,063
After all, taking the Three-Tails
means that the Hidden Leaf Village

212
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,980
will be in possession of
enormous military power.

213
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,566
We don't need such a thing!

214
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,655
Liar! The Hidden Leaf already
has the Nine-Tails

215
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:48,741
as well as the Jinchuriki!

216
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:53,203
People like you with that kind of power
have no right...

217
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,624
to criticize Lord Orochimaru...
or us!

218
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:00,334
I'm that Jinchuriki!

219
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:01,491
Wha--?!

220
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,133
But I...

221
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,761
don't use this power.

222
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:19,061
The Nine-Tails has this incredible power
that I can't control with my own strength.

223
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:23,357
I've hurt my comrades before
I even realized it happened...

224
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:27,695
That's why... I don't use its power.

225
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,951
If I hadn't told him such a thing...

226
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,167
<i>The place where someone thinks of you,
that's where home is.</i>

227
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:49,091
<i>So if someone is thinking about me,
then that's the place I go back to?</i>

228
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,513
You told him?

229
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,350
But no matter how much someone
thinks of him...

230
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,979
If you're going to use Yuukimaru
for Orochimaru's sake...

231
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,231
to make him control the Three-Tails...

232
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,400
That's not right.

233
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:14,033
I don't want Yuukimaru to get near
a Tailed Beast.

234
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,036
If he becomes like me...

235
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:22,082
No! I won't let Yuukimaru do
such a thing.

236
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:26,463
I don't believe you.

237
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:30,257
He needs a place to return to.

238
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:36,930
When his mother died,
Yuukimaru lost the place to return to...

239
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,267
So I'm taking her place...!

240
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,103
You should talk!
You're a follower of Orochimaru.

241
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:48,650
I have to show Yuukimaru that you're not
the person he should to return to!

242
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,278
Then that's fine!

243
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:53,783
But... for me...

244
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:55,951
that boy...

245
00:17:56,178 --> 00:18:00,390
Yuukimaru is...
the place for me to return to!

246
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:03,532
You...

247
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:08,380
Anyway...

248
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,898
this isn't the place
to argue about that.

249
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:14,928
While you were unconscious,
I took a look around.

250
00:18:15,283 --> 00:18:19,162
It's really complex in there and
I couldn't find anything like an exit.

251
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:21,977
But if we split up and search...

252
00:18:22,631 --> 00:18:23,590
Split up?

253
00:18:24,514 --> 00:18:27,100
You and me... The two of us...?

254
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:30,276
More than that. We need a thousand guys.

255
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:35,741
<i>Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

256
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,464
You three are ordered to take
Yuukimaru away from the Hidden Leaf.

257
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:56,510
Resort to any means necessary
in order to succeed.

258
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,162
That power...

259
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,706
go and enjoy it
until you're satisfied.

260
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:43,765
<i>Naruto...!</i>

261
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:48,896
<i>Naruto...</i>

262
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,523
Here's to the First Naruto Cup Challenge!

263
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:56,862
The "Let's-Get-Out-of-This-Crazy-Place:
Find-an-Exit" Contest!

264
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,280
Let's do it!

265
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,741
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

266
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,452
In your positions!

267
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,833
Ready, set...!

268
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,418
Go!

269
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,969
With this many guys searching,
finding the exit is a cinch!

270
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,638
All right! I'll find it!

271
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:23,680
No, I will!

272
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:26,934
<i>Whatever I do, I have to get out...
and find Yuukimaru...</i>

273
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,352
Yahoo!

274
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,065
I know!

275
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,776
I know where Guren is!

276
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:36,568
Huh?

277
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,779
I'm sure Naruto is with her!

278
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,448
They're in the Three-Tails' tummy!

279
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,598
Huh!

280
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,726
They're so excited...
just like a kid...

281
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:15,943
I feel so happy.

282
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,986
Yeah, almost like it's not me.

283
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:23,532
My fatigue's completely gone.
Not only that...

284
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,576
It's as though I'm filled with strength...

285
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,913
Listen, we've got to get
Yuukimaru away from the Leaf,

286
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,456
no matter what it takes.

287
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:34,891
You worry too much, Four-Eyes.

288
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,796
Right now,
I feel like I can't lose to anyone!

289
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,132
Not even Guren!

290
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:46,013
<i>Do what you can.
Not that I'm expecting much...</i>

291
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,226
Is that story true?

292
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,640
According to this child, Yuukimaru,

293
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:57,734
Guren the Crystal Style User is alive...

294
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,197
He says that she and Naruto
were swallowed by the Three-Tails.

295
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,532
The fact that we've searched this much
and still haven't found him means

296
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,993
that story may have
some truth to it...

297
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:11,581
But how do you know
that Guren is okay?

298
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,708
Guren made this for me.

299
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,128
If something happens to Guren
this will break as well...

300
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:20,007
I see.

301
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,967
That's proof that Guren is okay,

302
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:26,680
but it doesn't mean that Naruto is okay.

303
00:22:26,974 --> 00:22:27,975
That's true.

304
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,212
No one knows what the inside
of the Three-Tails' stomach is like.

305
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:35,771
Even if he is okay, Naruto is
with that Crystal Style user, right?

306
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,607
It's possible that the two
have already fought each other

307
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:39,900
and settled things.

308
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:41,778
Then Naruto is...

309
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,780
Right now, those assumptions
are meaningless.

310
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,283
We need to believe he's still alive
and find the Three-Tails first.

311
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,661
I'll... look for it...

312
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:54,456
Can you find it? The Three-Tails...

313
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:59,086
Yes... I don't know for sure...
but I sense it...

314
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:03,048
But what'll we do after
we find the Three-Tails?

315
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,801
I'll seal it once more.

316
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:09,012
All right. We'll try to rescue Naruto
while you're doing that.

317
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,306
In the event the Three-Tails
becomes violent,

318
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:16,895
Yamato, bring Shino with you
in case Guren is with Naruto.

319
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,231
Sai, you're on aerial standby.

320
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,942
The rest of you will guard
the surrounding area.

321
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:32,244
We're up against Kabuto...
no telling what he might do.

322
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,373
Look after Naruto.

323
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:35,874
Right...

324
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,333
You guys be careful, too.

325
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:39,835
Shino!

326
00:23:40,838 --> 00:23:41,839
Let's get going.

327
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,380
Understood.

328
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:50,846
Okay, everyone!

329
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:52,474
We're the Sealing Team.

330
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:54,391
Let's move quietly from the very back,

331
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:56,769
so we don't agitate the Three-Tails, okay?

332
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,019
- Right!
- Right!

333
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,023
Naruto...

334
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:37,352
What's the matter?

335
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,770
They've been attacked...
every one of my clones.

336
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:41,980
What...?

337
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:46,736
That sound... It's them.

338
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,779
This is bad. We're outnumbered...

339
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:00,142
What...?

340
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:09,844
There was one that huge, too?!

341
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:12,887
No choice but to fight.

342
00:25:13,305 --> 00:25:15,683
Can you fight in your condition?!

343
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:17,601
Then where's a way to escape?!

344
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:22,272
You're right, there isn't one.

345
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:27,110
<i>Crystal Style: Hexagonal Shuriken!</i>

346
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:33,867
You see! No effect at all.

347
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:37,538
I'll be the decoy, so run when
you get the chance, okay?!

348
00:25:37,913 --> 00:25:38,779
Here I go!

349
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,390
Take this!

350
00:25:59,852 --> 00:26:00,853
Guren!

351
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:03,063
Heh! How do you like that?!

352
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:14,074
- Are you all right?
- Uh... yeah.

353
00:26:16,034 --> 00:26:18,245
Damn...
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

354
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:21,707
Get on my back right now!

355
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,665
I can't do that!

356
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:24,919
Why not?!

357
00:26:25,502 --> 00:26:28,213
Because... my... pride...

358
00:26:28,255 --> 00:26:31,633
Fool! This is no time for
troublesome talk like that!

359
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:34,302
Put me down, you idiot!

360
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,431
Stay still!

361
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:40,142
Hurry up!

362
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,411
Right!

363
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:50,527
Yes!

364
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,452
I wonder if things are going all right
for Sakura and the others.

365
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,871
That's assuming Naruto is even okay.

366
00:27:02,998 --> 00:27:05,000
Of course, he's okay.

367
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,218
Because he's the person

368
00:27:07,397 --> 00:27:09,899
I want to have an all-out match
with one day.

369
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,340
What is it, Akamaru?

370
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,843
Seems our enemy is
making its appearance.

371
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:20,515
Good timing.
I was just getting fired up!

372
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,600
I'll express my feelings for Naruto
with my fists!

373
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,070
You people again?!

374
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,571
You knew it was us?

375
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:40,325
You can hide your shape and smell,
but you can't hide your bloodlust.

376
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,619
I won't lose to an opponent
I've beaten once before!

377
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,245
Don't underestimate us.

378
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,665
We're not the same as we were before!

379
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,208
<i>Dark Smoke Sphere!</i>

380
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,461
We can't get near them... like this.

381
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,421
We won't lose
in the barrage of grenades!

382
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,508
You are so naïve...

383
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,098
My kunai...

384
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:06,601
Appear!
<i>Smoke Dragon!</i>

385
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:22,784
What's the matter?

386
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,704
They're here... under us...

387
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,248
Okay. Sealing Team, get ready!

388
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,374
Wait...

389
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,000
There's no way out.

390
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:34,003
Guren and Naruto are
looking for a way out.

391
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,380
A way out?

392
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:39,008
If we open up a hole from the outside,
that'll be their way out.

393
00:28:39,595 --> 00:28:40,929
What's going on?

394
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:44,973
First, we'll have to see what's
at the bottom of the lake.

395
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:46,141
Camellias...

396
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,435
Bring me a lot of camellia blossoms...

397
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:49,978
Camellias?

398
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,608
Why did you save me?

399
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:59,279
That was my line!
Why did you save me?

400
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:02,907
Because if you died now,
there was no way I could survive.

401
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:06,202
What? You're relying on me?

402
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,289
Hey, how is your wound?

403
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,000
Don't touch me!

404
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,961
Once we're out of here,
you and I are enemies!

405
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:18,715
Suit yourself.
But I'm not handing over Yuukimaru.

406
00:29:19,343 --> 00:29:21,553
Why are you so protective of Yuukimaru?

407
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,219
I told you before.

408
00:29:23,764 --> 00:29:27,726
Regardless of your reasons for
your loyalty to Orochimaru,

409
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,741
he is evil.

410
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,144
He's probably using you.

411
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:32,896
Like him.

412
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,065
Him?

413
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,777
Either way... a place with you
and Orochimaru,

414
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,490
is not a home Yuukimaru should return to.

415
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:44,657
I'll go and take a quick look up ahead.

416
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,452
Since my clones can't do surveillance.

417
00:29:55,921 --> 00:29:58,591
Damn... this looks really deep...

418
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,510
Guess we have no choice.

419
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,518
Fog...?

420
00:30:11,854 --> 00:30:12,761
This is bad!

421
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,105
Is it them again?!

422
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,150
What?!

423
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,906
Hey, who's there?!
What are you doing...?

424
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:29,619
It can't be...

425
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:34,707
Sasuke! What are you doing here?

426
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:54,060
Stop it, Sasuke!

427
00:30:54,563 --> 00:30:57,024
I have something to tell you!

428
00:30:58,442 --> 00:30:59,443
Stop it!

429
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,109
Sasuke!

430
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,417
This is the Three-Tails' fog...
I see...

431
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:26,009
<i>This fog shows illusions of
the weakness in the souls</i>

432
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,261
<i>of the people who stand
within in it...</i>

433
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:32,557
<i>If I stand inside it,
I will have to face them, as well...</i>

434
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,519
Sasuke, stop it!

435
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,007
You're...!

436
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:09,886
I've...

437
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,680
I've done something to you
that I can never make amends for...

438
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,265
I want you to forgive me...

439
00:32:14,685 --> 00:32:16,979
Even if it's meaningless now,

440
00:32:17,563 --> 00:32:21,651
I will protect your child to the end,
even if it costs me my life!

441
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,168
Sasuke...

442
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:45,171
You have a place to return to!

443
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,632
Did you forget about that?!

444
00:32:48,302 --> 00:32:50,165
Listen, Sasuke!

445
00:32:53,682 --> 00:32:55,559
Let go! Let go of me!

446
00:32:57,895 --> 00:32:59,104
Pull yourself together, Naruto!

447
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:01,312
What you're seeing is an illusion!

448
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,241
What?

449
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:15,994
You saved me.

450
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:18,913
You saw Sasuke Uchiha?

451
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:20,707
Yeah...

452
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,459
You know Sasuke?

453
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:27,672
I met him at Lord Orochimaru's place.
He's a scary guy.

454
00:33:28,258 --> 00:33:29,843
Is he okay?

455
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,175
Is he doing well?

456
00:33:31,428 --> 00:33:34,389
Uh, yeah... Why do you ask?

457
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:35,847
Isn't it obvious?!

458
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:38,099
He's one of us!

459
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,977
I have to bring him back and

460
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:44,439
tell Sasuke that he has
a place to return to!

461
00:33:45,275 --> 00:33:48,904
You... Are you seriously intending
to bring Sasuke back?

462
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,278
Of course!

463
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,363
That...

464
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:58,870
Sasuke...?

465
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:02,123
<i>This guy must be a real fool.</i>

466
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,877
<i>Of all the crazy things,
he wants to save Sasuke...?</i>

467
00:34:10,551 --> 00:34:11,928
What's so funny?

468
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,219
I've never met such a fool!

469
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:16,554
Where did that come from?

470
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:20,058
You're splitting my sides! Really...

471
00:34:20,102 --> 00:34:21,353
Hey, are you all right?!

472
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:33,821
<i>So that's the entrance to
the dimension Yuukimaru mentioned.</i>

473
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:40,078
<i>If we tear that membrane,
we'd create a way out...</i>

474
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:46,302
<i>Now!</i>

475
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,797
<i>Lightning Blade!</i>

476
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:58,596
What? The fog lifted...
Could it be flowing outside?

477
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,182
Wha--?! When did they...?!

478
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,017
Now there's no way to escape.

479
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,229
Damn! Not again...!

480
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,606
They sure are persistent!

481
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,108
<i>One more strike!</i>

482
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,779
<i>Come back, Naruto!</i>

483
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,080
We're ready!

484
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:26,066
Let's do it now!

485
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:46,227
Naruto, there's something
I have to tell you.

486
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:48,813
What is it?
This isn't a good time.

487
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:52,108
Remember I told you that
Yuukimaru's mother is dead?

488
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,401
Yeah.

489
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,778
I'm the one... who killed her.

490
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,072
What did you just say?

491
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:01,200
At the time, Lord Orochimaru was
trying to build the Sound Village.

492
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:05,204
I attacked Yuukimaru's village
on his orders.

493
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:10,459
But I collapsed there after
exhausting my powers.

494
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:22,805
That woman...

495
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,558
saved my life,
even though I was her enemy.

496
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,397
<i>Get away...</i>

497
00:36:30,422 --> 00:36:32,049
<i>I'll close my eyes to this if you go now.</i>

498
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:50,917
<i>Are you planning to betray me, Guren?</i>

499
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,377
But...

500
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:57,089
I... I...

501
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:02,803
Out of my desire to be accepted
by Lord Orochimaru...

502
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:03,971
I killed her...

503
00:37:16,778 --> 00:37:20,032
I had sealed away the memories
and emotions of that moment.

504
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:23,991
But when I met Yuukimaru,
they all came back to me.

505
00:37:25,245 --> 00:37:27,247
Is that why you protect Yuukimaru...?

506
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,497
As you said...

507
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:34,043
I hurt Yuukimaru's soul in a way
that I could never make amends.

508
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,088
I have no right to protect him...

509
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,090
Guren...

510
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,800
It's over for me!

511
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:44,387
But I will protect you
even if it costs me my life!

512
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,766
You must survive!
Please look after Yuukimaru.

513
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,352
It's weird hearing that from you!

514
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:54,647
Whatever happened in the past,
you're different now!

515
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:56,635
You...

516
00:38:01,365 --> 00:38:02,191
Camellia?

517
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:17,586
Yuukimaru...?

518
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:22,091
He's trying to show us the way out!

519
00:38:23,554 --> 00:38:24,555
Look out!

520
00:38:35,065 --> 00:38:36,358
Okay, now!

521
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:51,704
I won't let you die in a place like this!
We're going back together!

522
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:16,812
Still nothing...

523
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,189
Could it have failed?

524
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,775
No, there definitely was an impact.

525
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,235
But nothing's happening...

526
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:25,404
Hinata, can you see anything?

527
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,908
N-No... Not even with my Byakugan...

528
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:31,911
Naruto... Naruto won't come back?

529
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:39,794
Did it reach Naruto?

530
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,757
Furthermore, it seems to have awakened
the Three-Tails.

531
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,053
Shizune!

532
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,974
Sealing team!
Standby for the Three-Tails!

533
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,351
Right!

534
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:57,353
Sai!

535
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,403
Take Yuukimaru to a safe place.

536
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:06,904
Right!

537
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,907
- Let's go.
- No!

538
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:12,660
I'm staying here until Guren returns!

539
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,496
I'm sure she's all right.

540
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,831
Huh?

541
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:21,001
We're all thinking of Naruto,
that's why he'll return here.

542
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:26,507
If you think of her, Guren will return too.
No doubt about it.

543
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:30,845
Now then...

544
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:33,826
Okay.

545
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,266
Go!

546
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:43,774
We will begin
the Four-Corner Sealing Jutsu.

547
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:49,113
<i>Four-Corner Sealing Barrier...</i>

548
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:50,073
<i>Bind!</i>

549
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:03,836
The challenge starts now...

550
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,714
Until the Sealing Team
contains the Three-Tails,

551
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,174
it's up to us to suppress it.

552
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:11,844
Now then, we'll see just how well
my Wood Style works

553
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,304
against the Three-Tails.

554
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:21,270
All we can do is try...

555
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,778
We'll wait here. All right?

556
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:31,822
Okay.

557
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,378
Drink... It will ease your fatigue.

558
00:41:48,008 --> 00:41:51,011
You can tell what I'm thinking...

559
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:54,839
Everyone tells me that
I can't read their moods.

560
00:41:55,724 --> 00:41:58,060
I doubt that. Really...

561
00:42:10,572 --> 00:42:11,573
<i>Dark Smoke Sphere</i>

562
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:20,207
Stay hidden, okay?

563
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:21,098
Okay.

564
00:42:54,575 --> 00:42:55,836
<i>Water Shield Shot!</i>

565
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:35,946
Hide-and-seek, eh?

566
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:39,408
I've come for you, boy.

567
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,086
I've been able to determine
Yuukimaru's potential

568
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,010
and the limit of his power.

569
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:10,439
However, the Hidden Leaf are trying
to seal the Three-Tails once again...

570
00:44:21,662 --> 00:44:26,500
If by any chance, they are successful
in sealing the Three-Tails...

571
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:32,169
<i>When Sasuke achieves
the skills he needs...</i>

572
00:44:32,589 --> 00:44:34,883
<i>The time for my reanimation will be near.</i>

573
00:44:35,467 --> 00:44:36,468
<i>When that happens,</i>

574
00:44:36,481 --> 00:44:38,942
<i>both the Akatsuki and Leaf Village
will be a hindrance.</i>

575
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:43,347
<i>Our current operation is preparation
for when that happens.</i>

576
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,433
We won't have to worry about

577
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:48,644
the Akatsuki using
the power of the Three-Tails, but...

578
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:53,524
It will force a big change
in Lord Orochimaru's future strategy.

579
00:44:55,571 --> 00:44:57,114
We must avoid that...

580
00:44:58,907 --> 00:45:02,244
If I use this, we may lose Yuukimaru...

581
00:45:02,703 --> 00:45:05,706
However, rather than lose
the Three-Tails...

582
00:45:12,004 --> 00:45:15,215
Never mind... if I lose Yuukimaru!

583
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:20,011
I'll use Yuukimaru's remaining power
to make the Three-Tails go wild,

584
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,469
and destroy the Leaf ninja...!

585
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:37,443
Where's Kabuto...?

586
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:40,320
Huh, I heard everything.

587
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:43,786
So Four-Eyes isn't here?

588
00:45:44,745 --> 00:45:48,207
So there's no one to give us orders...

589
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:58,091
We're not the same as before.

590
00:45:58,688 --> 00:46:01,775
There's no need to hang
around you anymore...

591
00:46:02,888 --> 00:46:04,473
Well, it looks that way...

592
00:46:08,477 --> 00:46:09,812
You guys are so easygoing.

593
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:11,602
What...?

594
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:15,647
You're just cast-offs...
pawns who have outlived their usefulness.

595
00:46:16,109 --> 00:46:19,779
And you don't even know that
I've got you in a vital spot.

596
00:46:20,447 --> 00:46:21,740
Say that again!

597
00:46:22,006 --> 00:46:24,300
You're not one of us anymore!

598
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:26,784
Want to settle it now?

599
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:27,868
Settle?

600
00:46:32,417 --> 00:46:34,461
What?! What's so funny?!

601
00:46:36,687 --> 00:46:38,231
It's about time!

602
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:47,221
What...?! My body feels strange...

603
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:51,099
I can't stop shaking...

604
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:52,434
Hey, what's happening?!

605
00:46:55,399 --> 00:46:56,400
Fools!

606
00:46:57,025 --> 00:46:59,986
You should know that
there's a risk to attaining power!

607
00:47:00,612 --> 00:47:03,907
I heard your power has
some side effects!

608
00:47:04,616 --> 00:47:05,909
Side effects...?!

609
00:47:06,118 --> 00:47:07,119
Yeah...

610
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,872
And left alone, it will eat you up
from the inside out.

611
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:13,997
N-No... I don't want that to happen!

612
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:17,501
N-No way... I don't want to die!

613
00:47:18,922 --> 00:47:21,758
Unless you get the antidote from Kabuto
before the time runs out,

614
00:47:21,828 --> 00:47:25,623
you'll destroy yourselves
with your own power!

615
00:47:26,096 --> 00:47:27,597
Kabuto entrusted the drug to me.

616
00:47:28,015 --> 00:47:30,476
If you say you won't betray
Lord Orochimaru,

617
00:47:30,498 --> 00:47:31,750
I just may give it to you.

618
00:47:34,271 --> 00:47:36,648
All right. I swear my loyalty.

619
00:47:37,065 --> 00:47:39,108
H-Hurry... give me the antidote.

620
00:47:39,443 --> 00:47:42,989
Know this! No matter how hard you try,

621
00:47:43,008 --> 00:47:46,136
you will never be able to escape
Lord Orochimaru's grasp.

622
00:47:52,956 --> 00:47:54,484
Kabuto said this...

623
00:47:54,907 --> 00:47:56,533
We've stopped
the Three-Tails' movements.

624
00:47:57,027 --> 00:47:59,529
And he wants to see that
power once more.

625
00:48:00,339 --> 00:48:01,127
No!

626
00:48:02,716 --> 00:48:06,303
When I take that medicine,
my head feels like it's going to burst...

627
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,948
Shut up! You will not refuse!

628
00:48:10,682 --> 00:48:15,395
Guren hasn't come back yet!
And maybe, she never will!

629
00:48:15,687 --> 00:48:16,772
Do you want that?!

630
00:48:17,648 --> 00:48:19,958
No... No!

631
00:48:19,983 --> 00:48:22,944
Then stop whining and do as you're told!

632
00:48:27,824 --> 00:48:33,079
O-Okay... One more time.
Just one more time...

633
00:48:34,081 --> 00:48:37,251
Yeah... this is the last time.

634
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:48,258
Here it comes...

635
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:09,613
Is that from Sai?

636
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:21,750
It seems Guren's subordinates have
powered up and attacked Sai.

637
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:22,834
Huh?!

638
00:49:23,005 --> 00:49:24,339
Any word from Kiba and the rest?

639
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:25,712
No, not yet.

640
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:29,132
No way...

641
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:45,691
Akamaru, you saved me...

642
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:49,152
If we hadn't hidden underground
due to your quick thinking...

643
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:53,198
Lee... Tenten...?

644
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:59,037
They couldn't have...!

645
00:50:10,469 --> 00:50:12,555
Thank you, Akamaru... I'm okay.

646
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:25,147
You're all okay.

647
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,190
Not at all.

648
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:29,776
If I didn't summon a protection Wall
from my scroll,

649
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:30,819
we'd have been goners...

650
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:34,031
Lee was no help, rushing in like that...

651
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:36,158
I-I'm mortified...

652
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:40,537
And after Guy-sensei always warned me that
overconfidence is a ninja's greatest enemy...

653
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:43,790
I didn't expect it...
That they'd be so strong.

654
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:44,833
No...

655
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:49,671
That transformation isn't normal.
We must notify everyone!

656
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:50,756
Yes...

657
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:59,097
This fog... We're already in their trap...

658
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:02,934
Protect the Sealing team!

659
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:03,977
Right!

660
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:21,078
<i>Dark Smoke Sphere!</i>

661
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:23,163
<i>Water Shield Shot!</i>

662
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,667
- Yamato!
- Right!

663
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:29,961
<i>Wood Style: Giant Forest!</i>

664
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:41,473
You...! Stop getting in my way!

665
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:46,436
<i>Wood Style: Giant Forest Jutsu!</i>

666
00:51:58,907 --> 00:51:59,991
<i>Parasitic Insects!</i>

667
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:08,333
What? Hey, stop!

668
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,377
Nooo!

669
00:52:28,398 --> 00:52:29,525
What's wrong, Akamaru?!

670
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:32,274
Everyone, stop!
Something's strange here.

671
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:35,902
The enemy?!

672
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,196
No... This is...

673
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:41,199
It doesn't look like the enemy at all...

674
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:44,661
Tenten! You can tell
what Akamaru is feeling?!

675
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:50,584
Sai!

676
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:57,757
This is the Three-Tails' fog...

677
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,594
The sealing isn't complete yet.

678
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,724
It's coming...! It's coming!

679
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,609
Gather your chakra!

680
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,402
- Yes!
- Right!

681
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:19,154
Cha!

682
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:23,700
Here it comes!

683
00:53:30,961 --> 00:53:32,546
Swallow it, Yuukimaru.

684
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:33,793
Huh?!

685
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:37,505
Swallow all of it!
You want Guren to return, don't you?

686
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:44,095
Okay, I'll do it.

687
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:48,225
Because my home is wherever Guren is...

688
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:08,161
<i>I made it back...</i>

689
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:15,335
<i>Feeling pain means I'm still alive.</i>

690
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:25,762
<i>Naruto...</i>

691
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:37,524
Wake up! Naruto!

692
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:42,862
Yuukimaru... you're okay?

693
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:45,365
This is no time to be sleep-talking!

694
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:53,248
We made it back...?

695
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:54,457
Yeah...

696
00:54:57,335 --> 00:55:00,011
Yuukimaru... Where's Yuukimaru?!

697
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:14,269
<i>Multi-Smoke Clone.</i>

698
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:22,152
No... Stop!

699
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,283
It tickles...

700
00:55:28,495 --> 00:55:29,173
What?!

701
00:55:34,418 --> 00:55:38,547
Oh dear... Your cute little bugs
are all crushed now.

702
00:55:39,173 --> 00:55:41,717
Well, time for the main event.
Here I come!

703
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:12,243
This is interesting...
I'll take that!

704
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:15,522
<i>Arise Smoke Dragon!</i>

705
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,475
<i>Like Sai reported...</i>

706
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:35,225
<i>they're completely different from before.</i>

707
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:55,954
Sh-Shizune-senpai...!

708
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:59,958
Ino has reached her limit... But...

709
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:03,128
Ino! Just hang in there!

710
00:57:09,137 --> 00:57:10,305
<i>Shizune...</i>

711
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:29,195
No way! Not that power again!

712
00:57:29,658 --> 00:57:30,533
Yuukimaru!

713
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:37,620
Wh-What is this?!
The enemy's jutsu?!

714
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:39,831
A-A slug...?!

715
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,876
It's Katsuyu,
summoned by Lady Tsunade.

716
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:44,419
- I'm sorry.
- Forgive me.

717
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:45,795
Why are you here?

718
00:57:46,216 --> 00:57:48,635
You came to help us, Katsuyu?

719
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:53,428
Lady Tsunade has
been concerned about

720
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:57,515
the effectiveness of the Sealing Jutsu
against the Tailed Beast.

721
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:03,108
She sent me to bring you
the chakra for the Sealing jutsu.

722
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:04,731
That will be a big help.

723
00:58:05,319 --> 00:58:07,947
Let me distribute it to you.

724
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:09,486
Please do.

725
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:11,070
Very well...

726
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:26,961
That Tsunade!

727
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,506
She sent Katsuyu...

728
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:31,174
Crap... More!

729
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:33,264
More power! Yuukimaru!

730
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:52,640
Naruto!

731
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:55,532
What is it?

732
00:58:58,535 --> 00:58:59,786
Will I be forgiven...?

733
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:03,289
I mean... Will he forgive me?

734
00:59:04,878 --> 00:59:11,176
When Yuukimaru finds out that
I'm the one who killed his mother?

735
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:14,930
Sheesh! Are you still
mulling over that?

736
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:19,222
I'm prepared to protect Yuukimaru.

737
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:21,849
If I were you,
I'd keep thinking about him!

738
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:28,106
Even if I'm despised,
or rejected, or hated!

739
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:34,112
Whether or not... he thinks of me
as his home...

740
00:59:34,157 --> 00:59:37,661
has nothing to do with it!
I'd keep on thinking about him.

741
00:59:39,621 --> 00:59:40,622
Yeah, you're right!

742
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:45,126
Then, I'll be a fool too...
just like you, Naruto.

743
00:59:45,151 --> 00:59:46,527
What?!

744
00:59:48,714 --> 00:59:49,715
Let's hurry!

745
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,427
<i>Yuukimaru!</i>

746
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:07,270
I feel the power of the Three-Tails
beneath the water's surface...

747
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:11,190
I-It's enormous... I feel like
the chakra will explode any minute.

748
01:00:11,482 --> 01:00:12,775
Th-This much?

749
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:16,529
Without Katsuyu's chakra,
my power alone wouldn't have been enough...

750
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:18,698
Listen! If the Three-Tails falls into

751
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:22,243
the hands of Orochimaru
or the Akatsuki...

752
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:25,330
It will be disastrous
for the Hidden Leaf...

753
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:31,544
But the Three-Tails is
in our hands right now...

754
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:37,925
The only ones who can protect
our comrades in Hidden Leaf Village

755
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:39,135
from this power are us!!

756
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:40,603
- Right!
- Right!

757
01:00:41,517 --> 01:00:45,646
Katsuyu... Can you increase
your chakra even further?

758
01:00:46,063 --> 01:00:47,857
Yes... I will try.

759
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:51,522
We'll send it to the other dimension
in one go.

760
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:52,899
R-Right.

761
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:14,796
Th-They're still trying to
control the Three-Tails.

762
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:24,138
Yuukimaru, unleash the power
of the Three-Tails! Make it go wild!

763
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:27,896
Trample the Hidden Leaf!

764
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:33,598
Sai, did they attack you too?

765
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:34,982
Yeah...

766
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:37,318
They got Yuukimaru!

767
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:41,447
This is...?

768
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:44,742
No doubt about it! It's them!

769
01:01:45,414 --> 01:01:46,665
Wait!

770
01:01:48,083 --> 01:01:51,962
Wh-What are you doing?!
It's time to get revenge!

771
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:55,420
If we jump in now, there's a chance
we'll hit each other with friendly fire.

772
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:59,716
Yeah, even Akamaru's sense of smell
will be useless.

773
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:04,512
We must wait and see.

774
01:02:05,012 --> 01:02:08,015
Oh man! This is so frustrating!

775
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:22,280
<i>It seems the enemy is using
Yuukimaru to control the Three-Tails.</i>

776
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:28,870
<i>At this rate, Shizune's Sealing team
is in danger.</i>

777
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:32,749
<i>It's a touchy situation...</i>

778
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:38,337
<i>Countering all these clones
is impossible!</i>

779
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:49,140
It's no good!

780
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:50,349
I can't dodge them all!!

781
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:05,573
It's about time...

782
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:08,159
<i>Binding Smoke Prison!</i>

783
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:22,673
To think that I would have the chance
to personally bring down

784
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:25,843
the renowned Kakashi of the Hidden Leaf.

785
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:30,389
It was worth surviving just for this...

786
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:32,934
Wha--?!

787
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:38,523
Although not to your extent, I use
Shadow Clones too.

788
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:41,025
<i>Lightning Blade!</i>

789
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:45,822
This is bad.

790
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:59,752
They have a saying about smoke
and fools liking high places.

791
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:03,089
<i>Smoke Dragon!</i>

792
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:09,220
The Wood Style is useless
against smoke,

793
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:10,429
since it can change form at will.

794
01:04:10,888 --> 01:04:14,058
Then, I must adapt my style...

795
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:16,644
<i>Water Style: Hand of Waves!</i>

796
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:23,526
What?

797
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:29,740
Smoke is a vapor, so by
liquefying it with water...

798
01:04:29,782 --> 01:04:33,619
it can't be controlled freely.
Not against me and my Water Style.

799
01:04:34,328 --> 01:04:36,247
Your jutsu is meaningless now.

800
01:04:43,629 --> 01:04:44,714
Take this!

801
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,435
Don't forget that I have a third arm.

802
01:05:13,367 --> 01:05:15,036
Playtime is over.

803
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:22,418
It's useless!

804
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:24,795
<i>Spindle Formation!</i>

805
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:31,552
Why... Why?!

806
01:05:31,969 --> 01:05:36,223
Your jutsu was quite effective
against my insects.

807
01:05:36,682 --> 01:05:40,853
However... the cause of your defeat
lies in the fact that you fought with

808
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:43,648
Hinata of the Hyuga Clan.
To explain...

809
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:48,110
<i>Hinata, I need to speak with you.</i>

810
01:05:49,324 --> 01:05:51,013
<i>Shino, what's wrong?</i>

811
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:53,449
<i>Any little thing will do.</i>

812
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:57,995
<i>Can you tell me anything about
that Crystal Style user?</i>

813
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:02,875
<i>Unfortunately, her jutsu is flawless.</i>

814
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:07,880
<i>If I hadn't covered my body with chakra
in time... I would have been...</i>

815
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:11,133
<i>Speaking of chakra covering
the entire body...!</i>

816
01:06:11,175 --> 01:06:14,428
<i>Shino, watch out for that slimy guy!</i>

817
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:17,139
<i>He will be a formidable opponent
for you.</i>

818
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:18,933
<i>Why is that?</i>

819
01:06:19,725 --> 01:06:21,602
<i>His body is his jutsu.</i>

820
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:25,606
<i>That bodysuit is filled with chakra</i>

821
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:27,984
<i>and he's able to
change his form at will.</i>

822
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:33,447
<i>I used my Gentle Fist against him
and he just twisted his body away.</i>

823
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:36,450
<i>He countered your Gentle Fist...</i>

824
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:41,539
<i>The problem was the body fluid that
got on my hand when I grazed him.</i>

825
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:46,877
<i>The enemy's entire body is covered
with a sticky mucus.</i>

826
01:06:49,922 --> 01:06:51,966
I had prior data, so from the start...

827
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:58,264
I concentrated on scraping that
troublesome mucus from your body.

828
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:00,725
Since we started...?!

829
01:07:00,975 --> 01:07:06,605
Yes! I focused my attacks on making
that mucous membrane

830
01:07:06,647 --> 01:07:12,028
as thin as possible so that it would
break easily.

831
01:07:13,821 --> 01:07:14,905
That is all.

832
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:26,584
It's over...?

833
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:27,710
Yes...

834
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:29,420
It took some time but...

835
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,131
Kakashi-sensei!

836
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:35,468
You're all okay...

837
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:37,720
What about you guys?

838
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:42,308
Well... we made it somehow.
But what about Naruto?

839
01:07:42,808 --> 01:07:43,976
We haven't found him yet.

840
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:46,187
I'm sorry about Yuukimaru...

841
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:53,527
Now then, we'll head out
to assist the Sealing team.

842
01:07:53,986 --> 01:07:55,404
- Yes!
- Right!

843
01:07:56,243 --> 01:07:59,747
We will also recover and protect Yuukimaru!

844
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:02,912
But first, we'll see how
the Sealing team is doing.

845
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:05,706
They seem to be in a difficult battle...

846
01:08:32,529 --> 01:08:34,614
This time, for sure...
This time... the Three-Tails...

847
01:08:34,698 --> 01:08:36,575
Ino... you don't need to rush it.

848
01:08:37,034 --> 01:08:40,287
Just focus your mind on
stabilizing your chakra.

849
01:08:40,537 --> 01:08:41,705
Y-Yes...

850
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:53,587
No good... It's not enough.

851
01:09:00,182 --> 01:09:02,393
Damn it! It's not working!

852
01:09:02,671 --> 01:09:05,216
Is that all there is
to Yuukimaru's power?!

853
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:11,480
This isn't going to work anymore.

854
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:23,242
Then I'll have to resort...
to my final measure.

855
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:29,707
You'll die for Lord Orochimaru's sake.

856
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:33,799
Here!

857
01:09:39,633 --> 01:09:40,634
Yuukimaru!

858
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:42,511
Are you all right?

859
01:09:42,808 --> 01:09:45,727
So you guys were alive after all...

860
01:09:46,186 --> 01:09:48,647
Snap out of it! What happened?

861
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:56,150
Hey Yuukimaru! Wake up!

862
01:09:56,483 --> 01:09:57,568
Yuukimaru!

863
01:10:11,415 --> 01:10:19,381
You came back after all, Guren...
because I was thinking of you.

864
01:10:20,507 --> 01:10:25,012
Wherever someone is thinking of you,
that's the place to return to...

865
01:10:25,262 --> 01:10:27,973
Yes... that's right.

866
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:33,187
You were thinking of me,
that's why I was able to come back.

867
01:10:33,687 --> 01:10:34,688
Uh-huh...

868
01:10:35,105 --> 01:10:36,982
When I was trapped in
that other dimension

869
01:10:37,024 --> 01:10:41,278
inside the Three-Tails,
all I thought about was you...

870
01:10:41,987 --> 01:10:46,408
That's why you have to
return to me too, Yuukimaru...

871
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:52,206
I'm so happy.
I'm coming back to you, Guren...

872
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:57,378
You're the only one I can return to.

873
01:11:02,549 --> 01:11:08,055
Yeah, right.
That's the only place left for you...

874
01:11:08,519 --> 01:11:12,481
Since you can't go running back
to your mother's arms anymore.

875
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:17,147
Stop! Just shut up.

876
01:11:17,444 --> 01:11:19,738
No, let me just say this...

877
01:11:20,383 --> 01:11:22,302
Listen!! Yuukimaru!

878
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:27,157
I said to shut up!

879
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:30,577
It's all right, Naruto...

880
01:11:31,745 --> 01:11:32,746
But...

881
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:36,709
It's all right! You taught me...

882
01:11:37,798 --> 01:11:38,799
Guren...

883
01:11:43,215 --> 01:11:44,550
So you're prepared...?

884
01:11:45,175 --> 01:11:48,595
How noble. Listen, Yuukimaru!

885
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:54,560
The one who stole your home from you...

886
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:57,771
The one who turned the white camellia

887
01:11:57,813 --> 01:11:59,690
red with your mother's blood...

888
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:11,869
The one who killed your mother
is that woman...

889
01:12:12,953 --> 01:12:14,163
Guren!

890
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:18,042
Guren is actually an evil demon!

891
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:21,003
She hid the fact that
she killed your mother,

892
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:24,173
and got close to you, winning your trust...
just so she could use you.

893
01:12:24,214 --> 01:12:26,258
And she has continued to use you!

894
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:37,102
Yuukimaru! Don't you hate her?!
Don't you want to kill her?

895
01:12:37,561 --> 01:12:40,356
No one will stop you...
I certainly won't!

896
01:12:40,861 --> 01:12:44,031
Now take your anger out
on the Three-Tails!

897
01:12:44,485 --> 01:12:48,882
And order the Three-Tails
to destroy everything!

898
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:51,122
Why you...!

899
01:12:53,081 --> 01:12:54,082
Shut up!

900
01:13:03,675 --> 01:13:04,676
Guren...

901
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:09,806
I'm sorry... Yuukimaru.
What he says is true.

902
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:11,475
Please listen to me, Yuukimaru.

903
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:14,394
The Guren of the past committed
many terrible sins

904
01:13:14,419 --> 01:13:18,589
in order to serve Orochimaru.
But Guren is different now!

905
01:13:19,233 --> 01:13:22,070
She regrets all the things in her past.
She's filled with regret!

906
01:13:22,095 --> 01:13:25,473
And no matter what happens,
she will protect you!

907
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:27,152
No matter how much
you may hate her,

908
01:13:27,194 --> 01:13:30,489
she will keep on thinking about you.
She swore that to me.

909
01:13:33,956 --> 01:13:36,500
I fully realize that no matter
how much I may regret it,

910
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:38,919
no matter how many times
I say I'm sorry

911
01:13:38,956 --> 01:13:41,417
nothing will ever erase what I did.

912
01:13:43,877 --> 01:13:47,423
If you wish me dead, then kill me.
I won't resist.

913
01:13:48,215 --> 01:13:51,260
But... but if you can forgive me...

914
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:54,638
I will protect you forever.

915
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:03,021
Guren...

916
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:16,331
You're not going to hate me?

917
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:20,080
You're a nice person Guren...

918
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:25,210
You are the one
I should return to, after all...

919
01:14:26,086 --> 01:14:30,007
And I'm the one
you should return to, Guren.

920
01:14:33,051 --> 01:14:33,886
I promise you...

921
01:14:33,927 --> 01:14:39,016
I will never leave your side.
I will always think of you.

922
01:14:39,438 --> 01:14:44,693
Uh-huh... And I will
always think of you, Guren.

923
01:14:45,319 --> 01:14:47,029
For now, and forever...

924
01:14:50,699 --> 01:14:53,077
And ever... I love you.

925
01:14:54,745 --> 01:14:55,746
Yeah, me too.

926
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:04,338
The two of you...

927
01:15:04,791 --> 01:15:07,586
Don't ever be parted again!

928
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:14,348
What a farce... You weaklings
can lick each other's wounds...

929
01:15:15,182 --> 01:15:18,102
But a bond like that will break easily!

930
01:15:21,808 --> 01:15:22,686
What...?!

931
01:15:40,327 --> 01:15:42,579
Kabuto! You...!

932
01:15:42,996 --> 01:15:44,081
Naruto...

933
01:15:45,249 --> 01:15:46,291
If you get in the way,

934
01:15:47,381 --> 01:15:48,674
I'll kill you too.

935
01:15:49,132 --> 01:15:52,802
Kabuto! You're behind all of this?!

936
01:15:53,423 --> 01:15:54,657
You won't get away with it!

937
01:16:13,318 --> 01:16:16,071
Everyone... The seal will
be complete very shortly.

938
01:16:16,363 --> 01:16:17,739
Maintain your focus until it's over!

939
01:16:17,781 --> 01:16:18,782
- Right!
- Right!

940
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:04,911
What is that?!

941
01:17:06,538 --> 01:17:08,707
Tenten! There's a monster behind us!

942
01:17:08,832 --> 01:17:10,000
- Huh?!
- Huh?!

943
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:12,085
What is that?!

944
01:17:19,134 --> 01:17:20,719
Kakashi-senpai! Is that...?

945
01:17:21,386 --> 01:17:22,596
What a persistent bunch.

946
01:17:22,763 --> 01:17:24,848
It's my turn to pay them back for earlier!

947
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:27,893
Lee, physical attacks
won't work on that slime monster.

948
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:29,936
Neither will my insects...

949
01:17:30,687 --> 01:17:32,189
Man, what a pain.

950
01:17:33,273 --> 01:17:35,734
Perhaps we should leave this
to the two Jonin.

951
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:48,789
I wonder if this is
what you'd call "gross".

952
01:17:49,581 --> 01:17:52,000
- <i>We'll torment you...!</i>
- <i>We'll torment you...!</i>

953
01:17:56,046 --> 01:17:57,047
Huh?!

954
01:18:04,388 --> 01:18:06,598
They sure are... Gross.

955
01:18:10,524 --> 01:18:11,817
What happened to Rinji?!

956
01:18:12,396 --> 01:18:16,274
Rinji became part of
my collection, long ago.

957
01:18:16,608 --> 01:18:17,651
What?!

958
01:18:17,734 --> 01:18:19,528
He was such a nuisance...

959
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:23,371
<i>Continue... eh?</i>

960
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:28,704
<i>I'd be happy to be the one
reporting to Lord Orochimaru...</i>

961
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,081
<i>You?</i>

962
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:35,836
<i>I've done many things
for you as your spy.</i>

963
01:18:39,011 --> 01:18:42,807
Lord Orochimaru doesn't need
anyone besides me to serve him.

964
01:18:43,635 --> 01:18:47,389
Damn it! So it's all going
as you planned...

965
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:51,476
Yes... Lord Orochimaru is
an amazing man.

966
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:55,897
Everything has gone as he predicted.

967
01:18:56,648 --> 01:19:00,318
Guren and Yuukimaru's hearts
have become linked so strongly

968
01:19:00,318 --> 01:19:02,738
that they trust each other
to be the place to return to.

969
01:19:03,911 --> 01:19:08,124
Now, if this close bond is
shattered by their fatal relations

970
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:11,663
Yuukimaru's anger would
release an explosive force.

971
01:19:12,706 --> 01:19:14,124
That was supposed to be the case...

972
01:19:14,958 --> 01:19:18,962
However, even when he learned that
Guren killed his mother...

973
01:19:19,129 --> 01:19:22,048
Yuukimaru's anger did not explode.

974
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:25,594
Why...? Why is that?!

975
01:19:32,476 --> 01:19:36,438
The human heart is
such a strange thing, isn't it?

976
01:19:36,813 --> 01:19:39,483
You... are unforgivable!

977
01:19:44,488 --> 01:19:47,324
Toying with Guren and Yuukimaru like that...

978
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:50,452
You don't play with people's feelings!

979
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:59,044
Just what are you guys aiming to do?!

980
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:03,048
It's not only the Hidden Leaf
and the Akatsuki...

981
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:08,261
but all the Hidden Villages
will soon erupt into a great war.

982
01:20:17,896 --> 01:20:22,108
Lord Orochimaru has his eyes
on that violent future...

983
01:20:22,734 --> 01:20:25,737
That was the reason for
the Three-Tails... for Yuukimaru.

984
01:20:29,157 --> 01:20:31,451
That's all gibberish to me.

985
01:20:34,746 --> 01:20:35,480
Guren!

986
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:39,501
Go with Yuukimaru!
Show me you can protect him!

987
01:20:40,252 --> 01:20:42,254
I will! I'll protect him with my life!

988
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:48,969
I won't let you pass.
I'm going to kick your ass!

989
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:54,563
<i>Dead Soul Jutsu!</i>

990
01:21:06,903 --> 01:21:08,196
Guren...

991
01:21:08,827 --> 01:21:09,643
Rinji!

992
01:21:19,249 --> 01:21:21,877
I promise I'll protect
you. I will not fail.

993
01:21:29,473 --> 01:21:30,374
Guren!

994
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:32,596
<i>Crystal Style: Crimson Fruit!</i>

995
01:21:36,474 --> 01:21:37,684
<i>Guren!</i>

996
01:21:38,268 --> 01:21:41,313
Don't worry. I'll be right back,
so you wait here.

997
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:42,709
<i>Huh?!</i>

998
01:21:44,274 --> 01:21:45,317
<i>Wait here.</i>

999
01:21:46,573 --> 01:21:48,158
<i>I will come back for you no matter what.</i>

1000
01:21:51,531 --> 01:21:55,911
<i>Don't go! Guren, you're the only one
I have to return to!</i>

1001
01:21:56,453 --> 01:21:59,289
Don't worry. I won't die.

1002
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:06,917
What?!

1003
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:10,175
It's useless.

1004
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:12,052
Crystals are formed when

1005
01:22:12,052 --> 01:22:17,265
identical polyhedrons
are aligned in a uniform pattern.

1006
01:22:17,891 --> 01:22:20,644
I can stop the crystals from forming

1007
01:22:20,644 --> 01:22:25,899
by vibrating the air
with the bats' ultrasonic waves.

1008
01:22:28,485 --> 01:22:32,989
Yes... Your Crystal Style
was never a threat to me.

1009
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:39,037
Didn't I tell you it's useless?

1010
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,748
You're troublesome
even when you're dead.

1011
01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:55,428
After Guren,
it's you... Yuukimaru.

1012
01:22:55,887 --> 01:22:56,733
Huh?!

1013
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:11,695
No you don't!

1014
01:23:12,278 --> 01:23:14,656
I will protect Yuukimaru with my life!

1015
01:23:15,365 --> 01:23:16,449
Guren!

1016
01:23:17,784 --> 01:23:20,161
Your Crystal Style...
won't work anymore.

1017
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:22,789
Nothing works against the dead.

1018
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:26,876
Now you can't manipulate
your bats, can you?

1019
01:23:29,087 --> 01:23:30,088
<i>Crystal Style...</i>

1020
01:23:32,257 --> 01:23:33,341
What--?!

1021
01:23:33,508 --> 01:23:36,052
Return to the underworld quietly!

1022
01:23:43,059 --> 01:23:43,753
Guren!

1023
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:53,695
No...!

1024
01:24:20,764 --> 01:24:22,932
Don't go!

1025
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:44,996
The jutsu is broken!

1026
01:24:45,997 --> 01:24:53,296
That... can't be...! You said you'd...
You said you'd protect Yuukimaru...!

1027
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:04,974
Yuukimaru!

1028
01:25:09,229 --> 01:25:11,648
The Three-Tails will be
getting tired soon...

1029
01:25:12,315 --> 01:25:13,483
Then we'll finish it at once.

1030
01:25:16,444 --> 01:25:17,445
What?!

1031
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:24,160
Where is the Three-Tails
getting all this strength?

1032
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:28,414
I'm not sure, but it seems
its chakra suddenly increased.

1033
01:26:02,532 --> 01:26:04,242
Yamato, use your Wood Style
to restrain it.

1034
01:26:04,742 --> 01:26:06,119
I will deliver the finishing blow.

1035
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:07,120
Right.

1036
01:26:18,756 --> 01:26:19,757
<i>Lightning Blade!</i>

1037
01:26:45,325 --> 01:26:46,326
Kakashi-senpai.

1038
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:47,452
Yeah.

1039
01:26:49,495 --> 01:26:51,539
Find the Sealing Team
and rescue them!

1040
01:26:52,081 --> 01:26:53,082
- Right!
- Right!

1041
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:06,054
Three-Tails!

1042
01:27:15,152 --> 01:27:18,698
The moment he lost Guren,
with whom he shared a strong bond...

1043
01:27:19,031 --> 01:27:22,200
the latent power in Yuukimaru
was released.

1044
01:27:22,445 --> 01:27:24,906
To think that the sadness of losing
the place he should return to

1045
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:26,824
would be this powerful...

1046
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:29,577
Yuukimaru! Stop...!

1047
01:27:32,747 --> 01:27:33,748
It's no good!

1048
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:37,502
Huh?! Yuukimaru!

1049
01:27:38,628 --> 01:27:40,713
Can you hear me, Yuukimaru?!

1050
01:27:41,547 --> 01:27:43,508
It's me! Naruto!

1051
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:46,010
Please snap out of it...

1052
01:27:46,469 --> 01:27:47,470
Yuukimaru!

1053
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:56,229
Damn it!

1054
01:27:56,938 --> 01:27:57,981
Calm down!

1055
01:28:04,362 --> 01:28:05,363
Yuukimaru...

1056
01:28:28,511 --> 01:28:31,806
Kill them all! Destroy them!

1057
01:28:55,961 --> 01:28:57,421
I'll have to stop it.

1058
01:28:58,041 --> 01:28:59,792
<i>Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

1059
01:29:01,127 --> 01:29:02,128
Let's do it!

1060
01:29:16,517 --> 01:29:18,644
Damn it! My Rasengan doesn't work!

1061
01:29:19,812 --> 01:29:22,857
And yet, I can't use
the Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken.

1062
01:29:25,943 --> 01:29:27,987
But what I can do...

1063
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:32,992
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

1064
01:29:38,081 --> 01:29:41,584
Bro! That's the Three-Tails, right?

1065
01:29:42,543 --> 01:29:46,130
It seems things have
gotten out of hand.

1066
01:29:46,839 --> 01:29:49,258
I wouldn't call you guys otherwise.

1067
01:29:49,842 --> 01:29:52,053
Gamatatsu, get ready for
the Toad Water Pistol!

1068
01:29:52,351 --> 01:29:53,060
Right.

1069
01:29:53,225 --> 01:29:54,226
Wait, Gamatatsu!

1070
01:29:54,645 --> 01:29:55,187
Huh?

1071
01:29:55,207 --> 01:29:57,376
What is it?! We're in a hurry here!

1072
01:29:57,517 --> 01:30:03,856
Think hard. The opponent is
a turtle-like beast that lives in the lake.

1073
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:06,567
Even if you increase the power
with the Wind Style,

1074
01:30:06,859 --> 01:30:09,320
what will be the effect of using
the Toad Water Pistol,

1075
01:30:09,362 --> 01:30:10,530
which is a Water Style Jutsu?

1076
01:30:11,781 --> 01:30:14,700
To beat a Water Style,
you need the Earth Style.

1077
01:30:20,623 --> 01:30:23,459
If we keep stalling,
the terrain around here will change!

1078
01:30:23,709 --> 01:30:25,877
I only have the Wind Style
so we have no choice--!

1079
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:28,381
Wind Style?!

1080
01:30:28,756 --> 01:30:32,718
<i>So I'm a good match
with Sasuke, huh?</i>

1081
01:30:32,969 --> 01:30:35,930
<i>Yes, only wind can defeat lightning.</i>

1082
01:30:36,139 --> 01:30:38,307
<i>No, that's not what I meant.</i>

1083
01:30:40,017 --> 01:30:42,437
<i>I mean only the power of wind
can help fire</i>

1084
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:45,773
<i>by making it even more powerful.</i>

1085
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:49,110
Fire Style.

1086
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:50,903
What about the Fire Style?

1087
01:30:51,577 --> 01:30:53,746
If we had Fire Style, my wind could...

1088
01:30:54,073 --> 01:30:55,533
I can use it.

1089
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:58,035
Huh...?! You can use Fire Style?!

1090
01:30:58,417 --> 01:30:59,793
Yeah, I can!

1091
01:31:00,037 --> 01:31:02,707
Why didn't you say that sooner?!

1092
01:31:03,172 --> 01:31:04,924
You didn't ask!

1093
01:31:05,174 --> 01:31:06,884
And? What about the Fire Style?

1094
01:31:07,253 --> 01:31:08,838
Oh, Fire Style...

1095
01:31:11,966 --> 01:31:14,010
What is it?

1096
01:31:14,343 --> 01:31:17,638
Damn it! I thought it was
a good idea...

1097
01:31:17,972 --> 01:31:20,933
So just tell me what's going on.

1098
01:31:21,601 --> 01:31:23,811
No... I thought we could
help the "Fire"

1099
01:31:23,811 --> 01:31:27,690
and make it stronger with my wind.

1100
01:31:28,816 --> 01:31:30,943
But fire is weak against water.

1101
01:31:31,903 --> 01:31:34,719
I see! If the Water Style is
stronger than the fire,

1102
01:31:34,745 --> 01:31:38,416
we'll just create a fire so strong
it evaporates the water.

1103
01:31:39,035 --> 01:31:40,036
Huh?!

1104
01:31:40,077 --> 01:31:41,287
Hey, Gamatatsu!

1105
01:31:41,370 --> 01:31:42,663
What is it, Bro?

1106
01:31:43,122 --> 01:31:47,084
Go back to the village and drink
all the Toad oil you can!

1107
01:31:47,752 --> 01:31:52,882
Okay? You have one minute!
I will summon you back in one minute.

1108
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:54,091
Gotcha!

1109
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:03,142
I get it! If you use oil instead of
water to fire the Toad Water Pistol,

1110
01:32:03,184 --> 01:32:05,061
the oil will spread everywhere...

1111
01:32:05,645 --> 01:32:08,940
Then you'll set the oil on fire
with your Fire Style.

1112
01:32:09,482 --> 01:32:10,483
That's right.

1113
01:32:10,691 --> 01:32:13,945
We can use the same timing
as the Toad Water Pistol

1114
01:32:14,111 --> 01:32:15,571
and we won't need to practice first!

1115
01:32:15,821 --> 01:32:17,406
All right! This'll work!

1116
01:32:18,866 --> 01:32:19,867
Yuukimaru!

1117
01:32:24,163 --> 01:32:27,124
Guren... That promise
you couldn't keep...

1118
01:32:27,917 --> 01:32:29,585
I swear I'll keep your promise for you!

1119
01:32:30,253 --> 01:32:32,338
Naruto! It's been one minute!

1120
01:32:32,713 --> 01:32:33,714
Right!

1121
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:35,550
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

1122
01:32:37,218 --> 01:32:38,219
Did you have enough time?

1123
01:32:38,469 --> 01:32:39,470
Uh-huh.

1124
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:40,846
Just about.

1125
01:32:42,765 --> 01:32:44,934
Mmm, we're ready, Naruto!

1126
01:32:45,142 --> 01:32:45,722
Yeah!

1127
01:32:51,315 --> 01:32:54,026
All right! We'll use
this new collaboration jutsu...

1128
01:32:54,324 --> 01:32:55,908
and aim for its face!

1129
01:32:56,243 --> 01:32:57,410
Its weak point is the eyes!

1130
01:33:04,954 --> 01:33:06,706
All right, are we set?!

1131
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:10,501
It's do-or-die!
Failure is not an option.

1132
01:33:10,876 --> 01:33:12,169
Right, Bro.

1133
01:33:16,215 --> 01:33:17,508
Let's do it, Gamatatsu!

1134
01:33:18,009 --> 01:33:19,010
Okay!

1135
01:33:21,137 --> 01:33:24,432
<i>Collaboration Jutsu!
Wind Style: Toad Flame Bombs!</i>

1136
01:33:30,062 --> 01:33:31,063
Now!

1137
01:33:49,540 --> 01:33:52,168
We did it! It worked, Bro.

1138
01:33:52,668 --> 01:33:54,670
Yeah... You did a good job.

1139
01:34:16,317 --> 01:34:18,277
Looks like it's over for now.

1140
01:34:18,944 --> 01:34:20,821
Well then, we'll be going.

1141
01:34:20,988 --> 01:34:22,573
Yeah... Thanks.

1142
01:34:23,038 --> 01:34:23,726
See you.

1143
01:34:27,745 --> 01:34:28,746
Yuukimaru!

1144
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:07,702
Yuukimaru...

1145
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:10,335
Let's go home together.

1146
01:35:31,642 --> 01:35:32,393
Oww!

1147
01:35:32,531 --> 01:35:33,532
Try to bear with it.

1148
01:35:33,936 --> 01:35:35,479
This should ease the pain a bit.

1149
01:35:35,855 --> 01:35:37,189
Thank you, Sakura...

1150
01:35:38,864 --> 01:35:42,409
<i>The wound is deep.
I'll do what I can here...</i>

1151
01:35:42,784 --> 01:35:43,785
Sakura...

1152
01:35:44,328 --> 01:35:45,705
How is Yuukimaru doing?

1153
01:35:46,073 --> 01:35:48,451
Shizune-senpai and the others
are tending to him now.

1154
01:36:10,765 --> 01:36:13,017
This is terrible. His chakra network is...

1155
01:36:13,434 --> 01:36:16,312
Yes, he's suffered a lot of damage...

1156
01:36:17,110 --> 01:36:18,903
Even with treatment,

1157
01:36:18,928 --> 01:36:21,138
it would be impossible
to restore him completely.

1158
01:36:22,193 --> 01:36:25,988
It seems the power to control
the Three-Tails took quite a toll

1159
01:36:26,030 --> 01:36:28,365
on Yuukimaru's body.

1160
01:36:29,283 --> 01:36:31,452
The jutsu shortened his life...?

1161
01:36:31,577 --> 01:36:32,578
Yes.

1162
01:36:32,787 --> 01:36:36,040
I can't be certain until we conduct
a thorough examination,

1163
01:36:36,332 --> 01:36:40,586
but it's likely that Yuukimaru no longer
has the powers he once had.

1164
01:36:41,629 --> 01:36:45,466
We've now lost our only chance
of controlling the Three-Tails...

1165
01:36:47,092 --> 01:36:50,805
Perhaps, for this child,
it's better that way...

1166
01:36:54,189 --> 01:36:56,352
Shizune, how is Yuukimaru?

1167
01:36:57,812 --> 01:37:01,440
He'll live. He's still asleep...

1168
01:37:12,701 --> 01:37:14,829
Thank goodness he made it.

1169
01:37:15,579 --> 01:37:16,386
Yeah...

1170
01:37:17,498 --> 01:37:18,330
But...

1171
01:37:18,922 --> 01:37:21,966
I wasn't able to help him
at all in the end...

1172
01:37:22,253 --> 01:37:23,254
What?

1173
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:27,581
I foolishly told him
"wherever someone thinks

1174
01:37:27,606 --> 01:37:29,802
about you is your home..."

1175
01:37:30,976 --> 01:37:35,689
But right before his eyes,
he lost that very home.

1176
01:37:36,308 --> 01:37:39,019
That wasn't your fault.

1177
01:37:39,067 --> 01:37:40,068
But still...

1178
01:37:40,694 --> 01:37:45,157
<i>You are the one I should return to,
after all...</i>

1179
01:37:46,033 --> 01:37:49,954
<i>And I'm the one
you should return to, Guren.</i>

1180
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:56,835
<i>I promise you...
I will never leave your side.</i>

1181
01:37:57,037 --> 01:37:59,164
<i>I will always think of you.</i>

1182
01:37:59,582 --> 01:38:04,753
<i>Uh-huh...
And I will always think of you, Guren.</i>

1183
01:38:05,344 --> 01:38:07,096
<i>From now, and forever...</i>

1184
01:38:12,678 --> 01:38:13,679
Naruto...

1185
01:38:15,562 --> 01:38:17,730
I'm sorry. Yuukimaru...

1186
01:38:25,614 --> 01:38:28,200
And that is the situation, Lady Tsunade.

1187
01:38:28,903 --> 01:38:30,613
I see... I understand.

1188
01:38:36,917 --> 01:38:39,753
Katsuyu, order everyone to return.

1189
01:38:41,248 --> 01:38:42,374
Are you sure?

1190
01:38:42,714 --> 01:38:43,976
We have no choice.

1191
01:38:44,591 --> 01:38:47,260
It would be impossible for them
to continue their mission.

1192
01:38:47,761 --> 01:38:50,222
Now that the child has lost his powers,

1193
01:38:50,466 --> 01:38:53,344
Orochimaru can no longer
do anything to the Tailed Beast.

1194
01:38:53,892 --> 01:38:58,688
We'll pull back for now, regroup,
and come up with a new plan.

1195
01:38:59,106 --> 01:39:02,485
But Orochimaru is not the only one
who is after the Three-Tails...

1196
01:39:02,818 --> 01:39:04,820
I'm perfectly aware of that.

1197
01:39:05,105 --> 01:39:06,774
But the Three-Tails is an adversary
that has given us

1198
01:39:06,815 --> 01:39:08,442
a great deal of trouble up to this point.

1199
01:39:08,949 --> 01:39:10,852
Even the Akatsuki won't
have an easy time.

1200
01:39:14,246 --> 01:39:16,248
I'll send ninja to
replace them immediately.

1201
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:20,418
Once they arrive,
have them tell everyone to withdraw!

1202
01:39:20,871 --> 01:39:21,703
Right away.

1203
01:39:23,422 --> 01:39:25,215
Those are Lady Tsunade's orders.

1204
01:39:26,043 --> 01:39:27,044
Understood.

1205
01:39:27,593 --> 01:39:29,094
We'll inform everyone immediately.

1206
01:39:31,138 --> 01:39:32,932
We have new orders from Lady Hokage.

1207
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:35,928
We will abort our current mission.

1208
01:39:36,393 --> 01:39:38,937
Our orders are to return to
the village immediately.

1209
01:39:39,348 --> 01:39:40,349
- What?
- Huh?!

1210
01:39:40,439 --> 01:39:41,816
That was sudden.

1211
01:39:42,149 --> 01:39:44,735
Hey come on! Is it really okay
to just leave the Three-Tails?

1212
01:39:45,319 --> 01:39:46,696
We won't have to worry about that.

1213
01:39:47,398 --> 01:39:51,652
They're sending ninja to replace us
and maintain the watch.

1214
01:39:51,694 --> 01:39:52,528
But still...!

1215
01:39:52,618 --> 01:39:56,038
There's nothing we can do
even if we remain here.

1216
01:39:57,741 --> 01:40:00,536
Everyone has suffered too many wounds.

1217
01:40:00,959 --> 01:40:04,045
Lady Tsunade has decided that
it would be more effective

1218
01:40:04,164 --> 01:40:07,042
if we brought back the information
we've gained this time around

1219
01:40:07,084 --> 01:40:08,919
and apply it to our next plan.

1220
01:40:11,630 --> 01:40:12,923
We'll move out tomorrow morning.

1221
01:40:13,340 --> 01:40:17,136
I want you all to get a good night's rest
before we move out.

1222
01:40:57,683 --> 01:40:58,684
<i>Guren...</i>

1223
01:41:01,895 --> 01:41:03,105
<i>Guren...</i>

1224
01:41:04,982 --> 01:41:05,983
<i>Gozu?</i>

1225
01:41:07,519 --> 01:41:08,562
<i>Why are you...</i>

1226
01:41:10,439 --> 01:41:13,400
<i>Why are you saving me...?</i>

1227
01:41:14,318 --> 01:41:17,488
<i>Do you remember... that day?</i>

1228
01:41:17,905 --> 01:41:22,826
<i>I was placed in solitary after losing
control during Orochimaru's experiment...</i>

1229
01:41:23,208 --> 01:41:27,212
<i>I was hardly given any water
or food to speak of.</i>

1230
01:41:27,414 --> 01:41:29,833
<i>I was on the verge of dying from thirst.</i>

1231
01:41:30,424 --> 01:41:35,596
<i>Then you came and kindly gave me
a ladleful of water.</i>

1232
01:41:36,430 --> 01:41:39,600
<i>Because of that, I was able to survive.</i>

1233
01:41:40,434 --> 01:41:42,478
<i>Ever since that day, I...</i>

1234
01:41:42,936 --> 01:41:46,732
<i>I don't even remember.
I must've been feeling generous.</i>

1235
01:41:47,566 --> 01:41:52,905
<i>Even if that were so,
I've always admired you since then...</i>

1236
01:42:01,872 --> 01:42:02,914
Guren...

1237
01:42:09,463 --> 01:42:10,882
O-Ow...

1238
01:42:12,126 --> 01:42:12,732
Huh?!

1239
01:42:14,837 --> 01:42:15,838
Yuukimaru?!

1240
01:42:18,263 --> 01:42:19,117
Damn!

1241
01:42:30,269 --> 01:42:31,010
Senpai.

1242
01:42:40,619 --> 01:42:43,246
Damn! Where could he have gone?!

1243
01:42:44,533 --> 01:42:46,074
His body's...

1244
01:42:46,792 --> 01:42:48,126
in no condition to...!

1245
01:42:58,554 --> 01:43:02,641
Yuukimaru!
Where are you, Yuukimaru?!

1246
01:43:19,449 --> 01:43:21,868
Damn! It's my fault...!

1247
01:43:25,824 --> 01:43:26,950
Yuukimaru...

1248
01:43:32,998 --> 01:43:33,999
This is...!

1249
01:43:34,708 --> 01:43:37,794
Why would he leave behind something
as important as...?

1250
01:43:49,806 --> 01:43:51,892
<i>There isn't even a single crack...</i>

1251
01:43:53,233 --> 01:43:56,028
<i>I see. So that's it...</i>

1252
01:43:58,815 --> 01:44:00,459
Yuukimaru disappeared?

1253
01:44:00,484 --> 01:44:03,195
How could he even move
in his condition?

1254
01:44:03,827 --> 01:44:06,307
Hey, Naruto.
You were in the room with him.

1255
01:44:06,323 --> 01:44:07,831
Didn't you notice?

1256
01:44:07,866 --> 01:44:08,700
No, I guess not.

1257
01:44:08,742 --> 01:44:11,954
Huh?! How can you call yourself
a ninja?!

1258
01:44:11,995 --> 01:44:13,205
Just what you'd expect from a Genin!

1259
01:44:13,205 --> 01:44:15,958
Shut up!
You were asleep, too, you know!

1260
01:44:15,999 --> 01:44:16,833
Why you...!

1261
01:44:16,875 --> 01:44:19,294
Don't put me in the same league
as a stamina freak like you!

1262
01:44:19,294 --> 01:44:21,505
Arguing won't do any good!

1263
01:44:23,013 --> 01:44:25,182
But I'm worried about Yuukimaru.

1264
01:44:25,634 --> 01:44:27,344
He has nowhere to go, and...

1265
01:44:27,684 --> 01:44:30,687
We can't just ignore him!
Let's all look for him!

1266
01:44:30,854 --> 01:44:31,688
I agree!

1267
01:44:31,765 --> 01:44:33,183
That won't be necessary.

1268
01:44:35,102 --> 01:44:36,103
The reason is...

1269
01:44:36,311 --> 01:44:39,398
because a child who lost his power
to control the Three-Tails

1270
01:44:39,439 --> 01:44:42,133
is no longer a threat to us.

1271
01:44:42,157 --> 01:44:43,867
That's not the issue here!

1272
01:44:44,278 --> 01:44:46,154
No, Shino is right.

1273
01:44:47,030 --> 01:44:50,033
We're under no obligation to look
for a child who ran away.

1274
01:44:50,617 --> 01:44:54,162
And besides,
we've been ordered to return.

1275
01:44:54,454 --> 01:44:55,455
But that's...!

1276
01:44:55,956 --> 01:44:57,291
Are you okay with that, Naruto?!

1277
01:44:57,332 --> 01:44:58,875
Yeah, there's nothing to worry about.

1278
01:44:59,751 --> 01:45:01,628
He can handle himself.

1279
01:45:04,089 --> 01:45:05,215
Naruto...?

1280
01:45:07,975 --> 01:45:09,393
We'd better be on our way.

1281
01:45:10,178 --> 01:45:11,888
Sorry to keep you waiting Kakashi.

1282
01:45:16,601 --> 01:45:20,897
I was hoping we could have caused
some trouble for the Akatsuki...

1283
01:45:21,523 --> 01:45:25,902
I'm sorry. I didn't count on
the Leaf ninja interfering.

1284
01:45:26,243 --> 01:45:28,037
And so, did that woman...

1285
01:45:28,704 --> 01:45:30,456
Guren die?

1286
01:45:31,192 --> 01:45:32,819
Regretfully, yes.

1287
01:45:33,309 --> 01:45:36,145
She possessed very interesting powers...

1288
01:45:37,087 --> 01:45:39,131
As if you mean that...

1289
01:45:39,573 --> 01:45:43,285
Maybe you were the one who killed her?

1290
01:45:43,879 --> 01:45:45,130
Heaven forbid.

1291
01:45:45,797 --> 01:45:47,174
Well, never mind.

1292
01:45:47,424 --> 01:45:51,053
We can find any number of replacements
for someone of her ability.

1293
01:45:51,345 --> 01:45:52,763
But Yuukimaru...

1294
01:45:53,430 --> 01:45:54,681
Leave it.

1295
01:45:55,057 --> 01:45:56,600
At this point...

1296
01:45:57,517 --> 01:45:58,518
Lord Orochimaru!

1297
01:45:59,061 --> 01:46:00,479
I'll bring your medicine right away!

1298
01:46:05,449 --> 01:46:07,659
<i>That host body has reached its limit...</i>

1299
01:46:15,035 --> 01:46:18,205
At this point, it has lost all meaning...

1300
01:46:19,087 --> 01:46:22,966
Because soon,
I will possess his body...

1301
01:46:38,023 --> 01:46:39,399
What's the matter, Naruto?

1302
01:46:43,772 --> 01:46:46,274
No, it's nothing...

1303
01:46:59,169 --> 01:47:02,255
Wow, it feels like I hadn't
been back in ages.

1304
01:47:02,589 --> 01:47:04,717
We had one mission after another...

1305
01:47:04,967 --> 01:47:07,803
Dinner tonight is at Ichiraku!

1306
01:47:10,173 --> 01:47:11,550
Say, Naruto.

1307
01:47:12,933 --> 01:47:13,548
Huh?

1308
01:47:13,892 --> 01:47:17,312
About Yuukimaru...
Are you sure it was best that way?

1309
01:47:18,014 --> 01:47:20,225
You used to worry so much about him.

1310
01:47:21,643 --> 01:47:22,644
That's okay.

1311
01:47:23,103 --> 01:47:26,940
Besides, even if we went looking for him,
he wouldn't be easy to find anyway.

1312
01:47:27,732 --> 01:47:28,775
What do you mean?

1313
01:47:29,234 --> 01:47:32,404
The Pervy Sage's words
were true, after all.

1314
01:47:33,071 --> 01:47:36,283
He said wherever someone cares
about you is the place you return to.

1315
01:47:36,741 --> 01:47:39,161
If you believe, and keep thinking,
about that person...

1316
01:47:39,293 --> 01:47:42,046
your feelings will surely
reach them, he said.

1317
01:47:42,212 --> 01:47:44,506
What? Is this... what I think it is?

1318
01:47:49,421 --> 01:47:52,340
So... we should keep thinking, too.

1319
01:47:53,223 --> 01:47:57,394
We need to create a place
that Sasuke can return to.

1320
01:47:59,806 --> 01:48:00,807
Right.
