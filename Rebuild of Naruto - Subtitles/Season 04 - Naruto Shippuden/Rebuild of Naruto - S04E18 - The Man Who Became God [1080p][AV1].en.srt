1
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:05,672
I'm coming in, Tsunade.

2
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:08,675
Jiraiya? Did you learn anything?

3
00:00:09,388 --> 00:00:12,058
I discovered the whereabouts
of the Akatsuki leader.

4
00:00:12,268 --> 00:00:14,020
What?! Is that true?!

5
00:00:14,253 --> 00:00:15,421
Tell me more!

6
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:19,185
We'll use that information
to plan a surprise attack!

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,699
Don't be hasty, now.

8
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,315
This isn't like plotting
a sequel to your novel!

9
00:00:24,456 --> 00:00:25,999
We don't have the time to waste!

10
00:00:26,307 --> 00:00:28,935
Haste makes waste.

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,522
Especially with the stakes
this high...

12
00:00:33,132 --> 00:00:35,593
Say, why don't we grab
a drink together?

13
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,287
Just you and me.

14
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:39,649
I'll tell you everything there.

15
00:00:39,887 --> 00:00:42,726
You fool! I am the Hokage!

16
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,544
And you're asking me to go drinking
in the middle of the day?!

17
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:47,964
Have you no shame when
our ninja are on duty?!

18
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,676
You know...

19
00:00:51,924 --> 00:00:55,605
You really ought to take your own words
a bit more to heart.

20
00:00:55,898 --> 00:00:59,026
Drinking sake straight out
of the bottle...

21
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,062
Remember, you are the Hokage, right?

22
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:06,483
This Akatsuki leader is in
the Hidden Rain Village, correct?

23
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:07,562
Yes.

24
00:01:08,244 --> 00:01:11,888
But that place conducts
thorough checks of anyone

25
00:01:11,913 --> 00:01:15,217
entering and exiting their territory
and they track how long visitors stay.

26
00:01:15,383 --> 00:01:17,761
Just preparing for the Joint
Chunin Exams is difficult each time

27
00:01:17,918 --> 00:01:21,922
because the village is
so closed off to others.

28
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:27,170
Doesn't seem like a place where
the Akatsuki leader can move about freely.

29
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:31,966
However... because security is so strict,

30
00:01:32,108 --> 00:01:35,386
they're able to keep other nations
from learning about their internal affairs,

31
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,847
and hence, keep a lid on any shame.

32
00:01:38,706 --> 00:01:39,748
Shame?

33
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,270
It seems that land has seen
much internal strife,

34
00:01:44,323 --> 00:01:46,450
and the village itself
has been split into two.

35
00:01:47,165 --> 00:01:52,462
Word has it that the leader of one side
is also the leader of Akatsuki.

36
00:01:53,604 --> 00:01:58,760
That land is surrounded by the three
great nations of Earth, Wind and Fire.

37
00:01:58,944 --> 00:02:02,754
And from ages past, it has been
the battleground of their conflicts.

38
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,876
As a result, there has never been
domestic stability

39
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,672
and the number of refugees
is continually on the rise.

40
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:16,010
That is why I will infiltrate and verify
the information we have gathered.

41
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,471
Then we can plan strategy...

42
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,473
It's too dangerous to go alone!

43
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,184
I am one of the Legendary Sannin
of the Leaf.

44
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,895
You know what that means as well.

45
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:31,943
I'm sorry...

46
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,697
that you always get
the short end of the stick.

47
00:02:38,107 --> 00:02:39,776
What's with you?!

48
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,752
I'm saying, you were
supposed to be Hokage.

49
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,834
The Third Hokage always wanted you
to be the next to--

50
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,086
I was never cut out for
that sort of thing.

51
00:02:50,245 --> 00:02:52,163
Being on my own suits me too well...

52
00:02:52,188 --> 00:02:54,941
You regretted not being able
to stop Orochimaru.

53
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:58,664
So all that time, you were tracking
his movements alone, isn't that right?

54
00:03:03,495 --> 00:03:05,998
I no longer need to do so.

55
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:10,593
That means I get to release
the sequel to my novel sooner.

56
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,919
Fact is stranger than fiction, isn't it?

57
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,155
Who would have imagined that
Orochimaru would die...

58
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,365
Remember how the three of us would
go up against Old Man Third and...

59
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:30,477
The flat-chested Tsunade has
become the big-bosomed Hokage!

60
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:32,775
Times are changing by the second.

61
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:35,274
You were beautiful back then...

62
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:37,426
and now, you're a
fifty-something granny.

63
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:42,070
It pains me to see how all the memories
of your lost friends and loved ones

64
00:03:42,095 --> 00:03:44,681
are stored inside
that big breast of yours.

65
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,561
And you know, the number
will continue to grow.

66
00:03:56,492 --> 00:03:59,745
I guess I shouldn't
wallow in sadness.

67
00:04:00,537 --> 00:04:03,999
My duty is to be a model
for the next generation

68
00:04:04,024 --> 00:04:05,650
and to help them.

69
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,043
For that, I'd happily give my life.

70
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,464
It's what makes us old folks cool, see?

71
00:04:21,664 --> 00:04:25,418
Your drinking habits are
worse than mine...

72
00:04:25,443 --> 00:04:27,320
Want to stop and rest somewhere?

73
00:04:28,443 --> 00:04:30,495
It's late. We have to go home.

74
00:04:30,593 --> 00:04:31,594
- Okay!
- Okay!

75
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,691
Hey, wait up!

76
00:04:36,685 --> 00:04:37,978
Akatsuki...

77
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,854
The leader is capable of organizing
a group so powerful...

78
00:04:42,843 --> 00:04:45,012
Who knows how strong he may be?

79
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:49,956
You'll be walking right into
the enemy's territory.

80
00:04:50,668 --> 00:04:53,922
Well then... I should set out.

81
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:57,336
Come back alive...

82
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:03,543
If I lost you too... I...

83
00:05:04,377 --> 00:05:07,631
You'll cry for me?
That'll make me happy!

84
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,295
But I doubt that it'll be
like the time Dan died.

85
00:05:12,465 --> 00:05:13,466
You idiot!

86
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,524
Then how about making a bet with me?

87
00:05:18,145 --> 00:05:20,772
You bet that I will die.

88
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:24,615
After all, you always lose.

89
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,150
But if I make it back alive...

90
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,974
Joking! I'm just joking!

91
00:05:45,438 --> 00:05:47,190
You know, I'm grateful to you.

92
00:05:49,861 --> 00:05:52,201
Rejection makes a man stronger.

93
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:55,438
In other words,
you can't call yourself a real man

94
00:05:55,463 --> 00:05:58,007
unless you can laugh off stuff like that.

95
00:05:58,465 --> 00:06:00,926
Better yet, make a joke out of it.

96
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,822
So a man's duty is to be strong?

97
00:06:05,137 --> 00:06:06,263
Kind of...

98
00:06:06,796 --> 00:06:11,718
And besides... men aren't the only ones
who seek happiness.

99
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,458
Humph... Stop trying to act so cool.

100
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,446
Without a woman,
you guys can't be rejected.

101
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,381
That's so true.

102
00:06:41,158 --> 00:06:44,286
If anything happens,
contact me through your toad.

103
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:46,989
I'll rush over myself.

104
00:06:47,184 --> 00:06:51,105
No need for that.
You must not leave here.

105
00:06:51,814 --> 00:06:54,608
The village relies on you now.

106
00:06:55,316 --> 00:06:57,318
There are other candidates
for Hokage.

107
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:01,630
There can be no stability
if the Hokage keeps changing.

108
00:07:02,445 --> 00:07:06,259
Right now, you are the only one
who can be Hokage.

109
00:07:06,803 --> 00:07:08,222
There's Kakashi.

110
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,848
And eventually, there's also Naruto...

111
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:16,317
You're really sold on Naruto, aren't you?

112
00:07:16,695 --> 00:07:19,865
But Naruto still has a long way to go,
even though you gave him your necklace.

113
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,538
You have high hopes
for him too...

114
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:26,321
You taught him the Rasengan.

115
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:29,198
Oh that... Well, call it nostalgia.

116
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:32,318
It reminded me of the days
when I taught Minato.

117
00:07:33,174 --> 00:07:37,040
Minato Namikaze...
True, Naruto does resemble him.

118
00:07:37,717 --> 00:07:41,388
Minato was a genius that appears
only once in a generation.

119
00:07:42,131 --> 00:07:44,926
There won't be another like him.

120
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:49,360
He was kind-hearted,
but had nerves of steel.

121
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,471
He rose to become
the Fourth Hokage so swiftly.

122
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:55,224
I've never been a parent, so I don't know
much about these things...

123
00:07:55,658 --> 00:07:59,933
but if he had been my son,
I think I'd have been awfully proud.

124
00:08:01,156 --> 00:08:05,034
Now that you mention it...
Naruto might not resemble him, after all.

125
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,837
Rather than a son
you boast about,

126
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,156
he'd be the problem child,
always up to mischief.

127
00:08:10,704 --> 00:08:14,208
Naruto is more like his mother...

128
00:08:15,006 --> 00:08:18,176
Wasn't she a former kunoichi
from the Land of Eddies...?

129
00:08:18,487 --> 00:08:22,700
Yeah... His personality and ninjutsu style
is just like Kushina Uzumaki.

130
00:08:22,948 --> 00:08:25,618
Yes... that's her name!

131
00:08:25,982 --> 00:08:31,196
That talkative, red-haired rascal...
She was such a tomboy.

132
00:08:31,471 --> 00:08:36,685
Kushina grew up to be a beauty,
but Naruto looks like his father.

133
00:08:37,265 --> 00:08:40,435
I can see Naruto's father in him...

134
00:08:40,819 --> 00:08:44,907
To me, it feels as though
I'm looking at my grandson.

135
00:08:45,798 --> 00:08:47,759
It is being passed on...

136
00:08:48,374 --> 00:08:51,627
the will of the Leaf,
from the past to the future.

137
00:09:03,705 --> 00:09:05,373
I guess I'll be off.

138
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,269
Oh, that's right!

139
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,560
I had one last warning for you.

140
00:09:11,721 --> 00:09:12,392
Huh?

141
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,324
Beware of the Foundation.

142
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,892
Yeah... I know.

143
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,156
Ah... Good then.

144
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,228
Farewell.

145
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:39,323
Infiltration is a success.
That was quite easy.

146
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,327
Now then...

147
00:11:46,745 --> 00:11:47,746
What is it?

148
00:11:49,365 --> 00:11:51,659
Someone is disturbing my rain.

149
00:11:51,981 --> 00:11:55,693
This chakra... He is strong.

150
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:03,302
<i>All right, where do I search first?</i>

151
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:10,860
Hot, hot!

152
00:12:11,845 --> 00:12:14,097
I'll have one of these, Granny...

153
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,068
Thank you.

154
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,404
I haven't seen your face before.

155
00:12:19,282 --> 00:12:20,449
You're not from around here?

156
00:12:21,028 --> 00:12:24,073
Well... I'm a writer.

157
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:29,248
I travel around and write about regional
cuisine and products for a magazine.

158
00:12:31,202 --> 00:12:35,790
Hmm... I see.
And how do you like my pork buns?

159
00:12:36,178 --> 00:12:42,894
Oh, they're delicious. I heard
about them, and they're amazing.

160
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,598
I know! Aren't they?

161
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:50,811
I'd like to introduce them
in our magazine. Is that okay?

162
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,356
In a magazine?

163
00:12:54,538 --> 00:12:56,542
Yes. Although, once I write about them,

164
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,779
you'll have such a big crowd
you won't be able to rest.

165
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,866
I-I see. That would be a problem!

166
00:13:06,282 --> 00:13:09,661
It sure is peaceful around here.

167
00:13:10,108 --> 00:13:11,034
Yes.

168
00:13:11,414 --> 00:13:16,212
This village is no longer plagued by war
thanks to Lord Pain.

169
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,299
We're so grateful to him.

170
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,008
Pain?

171
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,969
Yes, Lord Pain.

172
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,431
What happened to
Hanzo of the Salamander?

173
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:28,849
Huh?

174
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,478
Hanzo of the...

175
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,110
Thanks for your time, Granny.

176
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,701
Thank you for waiting.

177
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,328
Say...

178
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,413
What is that?

179
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,498
Huh?

180
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:56,418
Oh, that is Lady Angel.

181
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,292
You don't know?

182
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,131
They say it's good fortune to
put up origami

183
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:04,218
modeled after the Lady Angel
at the shop entrance.

184
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,596
An Angel...

185
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:12,367
<i>What is going on?
This land isn't divided into two.</i>

186
00:14:12,392 --> 00:14:14,144
<i>Instead, it's already united.</i>

187
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:17,356
<i>And the Hidden Rain Village
used to have a leader</i>

188
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,400
<i>named Hanzo of the Salamander...</i>

189
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:24,613
<i>It seems I need to check
this place out very thoroughly.</i>

190
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:36,083
Konan... When I stop the rain,
seek out the intruder with your jutsu.

191
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,418
Got it.

192
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:40,963
Ready?

193
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,018
Yes...

194
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,932
What a downpour.

195
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:55,561
Want to get a drink while
we wait for the rain to stop?

196
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,690
There are no bars at
a low ground level like this.

197
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:01,901
We'll have to go up higher.

198
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:05,029
Then let's head upwards
for some cover.

199
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,156
But are you sure?

200
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,492
Didn't you tell your wife
you're heading straight home?

201
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,954
Heh! It's okay.
It's an emergency mission!

202
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,999
I never heard of drinking
being a mission...

203
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,049
Heh heh... We're in luck.

204
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,471
Welcome.

205
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,163
Just two.

206
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,434
Give us sake and some chasers.

207
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,689
Today's not Sunday, is it?

208
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,484
Something must have come up
for Lord Pain.

209
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,820
Maybe he's leaving for another nation.

210
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:50,950
But it never rained on other days before.

211
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,953
Maybe it's something that
requires that much power.

212
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,996
But if it keeps on raining like this...

213
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,040
Hey! Careful with the words!

214
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:02,044
Lord Pain works tirelessly
for the people of this village.

215
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,129
Show some tolerance!

216
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,799
Guess you're right...

217
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,968
Sorry to keep you fellows waiting.

218
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,359
Hey...

219
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,889
But there's nothing!

220
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:19,395
No, no... You're in luck!

221
00:16:19,426 --> 00:16:23,221
Today, we have
our grand opening special.

222
00:16:23,388 --> 00:16:24,723
What? Really?!

223
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,443
What kind of service?

224
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:30,531
The Club Frog Special Torture Service.

225
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,120
You...! Who the hell are you?!

226
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:40,640
I'm the one asking the questions.
And I have a lot to ask.

227
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,403
Now! Run!

228
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:51,685
What?!

229
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,096
Give it up.

230
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,878
Do it, Konan.

231
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,027
Right...

232
00:17:47,175 --> 00:17:48,343
Now then...

233
00:17:48,792 --> 00:17:52,854
From your use of kunai,
I'm guessing you two are lowly ninja.

234
00:17:52,879 --> 00:17:54,464
Am I correct?

235
00:17:55,206 --> 00:17:59,002
Does that rogue ninja mark signify
that you're loyal to Pain?

236
00:17:59,324 --> 00:18:00,367
Damn it!

237
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,247
Where are we?!

238
00:18:02,806 --> 00:18:04,725
Inside the belly of a frog.

239
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:12,382
You'll never be found here...
No one will come to your aid!

240
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,885
Who the hell are you?!

241
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:20,307
I told you I'll be the one
asking questions. Remember?

242
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,018
Wh-What are you going to do
with that feather?

243
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,812
Tickle you!

244
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:30,067
If you don't want to die laughing,
then you'll answer my questions.

245
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,862
Regarding your leader... Pain.

246
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:41,620
Now talk! Tell me everything
you know about Pain!

247
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,208
Bear with it!

248
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:50,337
I won't... rat... on my comrade...

249
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,675
You're pretty stubborn, aren't you?

250
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,844
Well, I have another trick.

251
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,096
Wh-What are you going to do?!

252
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:04,977
If you refuse to talk, then I'll
use my jutsu and turn you into frogs!

253
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:13,135
Turn... you... to frogs...

254
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,911
What do you want from us?!

255
00:19:22,165 --> 00:19:23,750
Now talk!

256
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:28,292
We may be lowly ninja,
but we'll never betray our comrades!

257
00:19:29,572 --> 00:19:33,118
No matter what you do to us!
So don't take us lightly!

258
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:37,050
Hmm... Then I have no choice...

259
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:41,013
<i>Ninja Art: Toad Transformation!</i>

260
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:42,175
Stop!!

261
00:19:46,482 --> 00:19:48,359
You bastard! That's not fair!

262
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,898
Now then, you're next.

263
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,066
Are you ready?

264
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,738
The highest tower in the west...
Lord Pain is there.

265
00:19:58,358 --> 00:19:59,997
That's what people say...

266
00:20:00,696 --> 00:20:06,077
Huh? What?! You sure turned
on him easily... didn't you?

267
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,541
Well, no matter...

268
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,961
What did you mean by,
"that's what people say"?

269
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:18,467
Actually... No one really knows
that much about Lord Pain.

270
00:20:19,304 --> 00:20:20,691
What do you mean?

271
00:20:21,701 --> 00:20:24,287
They say he is of the Fuma Clan lineage.

272
00:20:24,761 --> 00:20:27,059
But no one really knows
what he looks like.

273
00:20:27,442 --> 00:20:31,072
And some claim that
he doesn't even exist.

274
00:20:31,316 --> 00:20:37,614
I walked through the town a bit...
and everyone seems to worship him.

275
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,988
So don't lie!

276
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,450
In this town, Lord Pain is a god.

277
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,744
It's not a question of whether
he exists or not.

278
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,622
He always watches over us.

279
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,502
He has a representative do
all the ceremonial rites,

280
00:20:52,527 --> 00:20:54,570
the speeches and the issuing of orders...

281
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,713
Through the Lady Angel!

282
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,966
Lady Angel...?

283
00:21:00,766 --> 00:21:02,919
He's your leader, isn't he?

284
00:21:02,944 --> 00:21:05,989
Why must he hide his appearance
from you too?

285
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,641
For times like this one.

286
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,351
I see...

287
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:13,397
You're not a remnant of
the old Hidden Rain, are you?

288
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,482
Just who are you?

289
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,943
Never mind about me.

290
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:21,905
What's this about
the old Hidden Rain remnants?

291
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:25,409
Heh... You really don't know
a thing, do you?

292
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,369
So you're an outsider.

293
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:33,583
Until recently,
those remnants would infiltrate.

294
00:21:34,414 --> 00:21:36,458
But that's not a worry anymore.

295
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:41,842
Only lucky fellows like you ever
manage to slip in from the outside.

296
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,431
Not a worry? What do you mean?

297
00:21:48,443 --> 00:21:51,404
I heard that this land was
going through a civil war...

298
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,186
It's not surprising that you haven't heard.

299
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,063
This nation is closed to the outside.

300
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:57,691
Well, I'll tell you...

301
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:01,822
The civil war ended long ago.
And we won!

302
00:22:03,534 --> 00:22:06,079
That's why Lord Pain is legendary.

303
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,786
He destroyed the Hidden Rain...
by himself.

304
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,002
I can't believe it...

305
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,213
No matter how powerful
this Pain might be,

306
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:23,467
the leader of the Hidden Rain
was Hanzo of the Salamander.

307
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:26,636
And there's not a soul in
the ninja world that doesn't know him.

308
00:22:27,424 --> 00:22:28,550
That's right.

309
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:32,934
But not only was Hanzo powerful,
he was extremely cautious

310
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:35,896
and made it very difficult for anyone
to approach him.

311
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:41,568
He had bodyguards on 24-hour duty,
and everyone, including children,

312
00:22:41,723 --> 00:22:45,059
who went near him were strip searched.

313
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:51,203
So how did he defeat Hanzo?
What ability does Pain possess?

314
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:55,457
I told you. We don't know anything!

315
00:22:56,291 --> 00:23:00,587
I can't believe it...
He defeated Hanzo by himself?

316
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:06,468
He's a god. He wields formidable jutsu.

317
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:10,931
But that is not why Lord Pain
is to be feared.

318
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:18,063
What is truly frightening is
his merciless heart of steel.

319
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:23,893
Everyone who threatened his ideals
was ruthlessly extinguished.

320
00:23:24,335 --> 00:23:26,880
He didn't stop with just Hanzo.

321
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,199
Hanzo's parents, his wife and child...

322
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:32,828
His relatives and friends,
and even their infants, were killed.

323
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,164
Then he burned down their homes.

324
00:23:36,591 --> 00:23:39,927
And he killed the emissaries of villages
allied with Hanzo.

325
00:23:40,687 --> 00:23:42,439
He erased them all.

326
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,465
It was retribution...

327
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,245
Just like a god, don't you think?

328
00:23:59,445 --> 00:24:00,586
A god...

329
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,149
Yes...

330
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:06,736
Then, just what is your god
trying to accomplish?

331
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:10,449
Even underlings like you must know.

332
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:15,078
It's the work of a god.
We wouldn't know what he plans.

333
00:24:15,473 --> 00:24:18,727
I see... Then if not a god...

334
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:22,502
you must at least know
something about the Akatsuki.

335
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:25,910
Never heard of such a name.

336
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:33,138
Your arms and legs are bound,
so that you cannot move.

337
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,724
But that's not all...

338
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,310
Your pulse is being measured.

339
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,688
And if you lie, I'll know instantly.

340
00:24:42,729 --> 00:24:45,106
Tell me everything you know!

341
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:49,112
Otherwise, you will end up surviving off
dragonflies and flies

342
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,822
for the rest of your life.

343
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:27,442
<i>Now then...
Time to hunt the infiltrator.</i>

344
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:31,696
Turn me into a frog or whatever!
I'm not saying anything more!

345
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:35,867
Even underlings have pride.
I'm a ninja too!

346
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,828
There's nothing I have to say
to an outsider

347
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,539
who knows nothing about our nation!

348
00:25:44,935 --> 00:25:48,355
Hmm... Still a ninja
even if an underling, eh?

349
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:52,811
Well... I'm not too keen about
interrogation either.

350
00:25:53,547 --> 00:25:57,926
Talk is over. However, you're going
to stay right here.

351
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:02,686
I'll go ask this god of yours in person.

352
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:22,247
Jiraiya! What's the big idea,
summoning me?!

353
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:23,916
If it's about the key to Naruto's...

354
00:26:23,941 --> 00:26:26,444
No, no. It's not about training.

355
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:30,589
I have my reasons, but I thought of
releasing you for the time being.

356
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,925
Release me? What's going on?

357
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:37,012
I'm about to fight
a pretty tough opponent.

358
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:41,850
So tough that you needed to release me?

359
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:43,518
It's just a precaution.

360
00:26:43,654 --> 00:26:47,199
Anyway, I wish to press
the storage release seal now.

361
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:48,857
Very well.

362
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:56,406
There!

363
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:01,328
How long until you return?

364
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:04,122
I don't think it'll take too long...

365
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:08,418
However, if anything happens to me,
go store yourself inside Naruto.

366
00:27:08,565 --> 00:27:10,942
Are you crazy?!

367
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:14,799
The key that corresponds to
Naruto's Eight Trigrams Seal

368
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,676
is transcribed on my belly!

369
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,888
Each year,
the Fourth Hokage's seal weakens!

370
00:27:20,082 --> 00:27:24,212
The key remains in order to re-seal it
when it becomes necessary!

371
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:28,229
To place such a key right next
to the safe is unheard of!

372
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,983
Still, Minato entrusted it to us.

373
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:35,278
It was always meant to be
returned to Naruto.

374
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:36,977
It's too soon!

375
00:27:37,002 --> 00:27:41,673
Once you talked me into loosening
the Four Symbols Seal...

376
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:45,246
You haven't forgotten
what the results were, have you?!

377
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:50,835
Yeah...

378
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:56,758
However, the fact that Minato left me
the jutsu for the key convinces me...

379
00:27:56,933 --> 00:28:02,522
that he intended for Naruto
to perfect that jutsu one day.

380
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,725
That jutsu? Are you serious?

381
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:07,602
Yes.

382
00:28:07,961 --> 00:28:11,464
Does Naruto even require such a jutsu?

383
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:16,069
He would never be able to
control the Nine-Tails' chakra.

384
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,638
Not only that...

385
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:21,157
When that key was loosened,
Naruto's own chakra was thrust aside

386
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,743
and a large amount of
the Nine-Tails' chakra leaked out.

387
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:25,853
The Nine-Tails nearly
took control of Naruto.

388
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,455
If the seal weakens any further

389
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,943
and the Nine-Tails completely
overtakes Naruto,

390
00:28:29,968 --> 00:28:32,721
it will be totally against
the will of the Fourth Hokage!

391
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:38,258
Minato used the Reaper Death Seal only
on the Nine-Tails' yin chakra.

392
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,096
He purposely split the Nine-Tails' power
into yin and yang,

393
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:45,473
and sealed the yang power into Naruto.

394
00:28:45,498 --> 00:28:48,000
He wanted to leave
the Nine-Tails' chakra to Naruto.

395
00:28:48,702 --> 00:28:50,245
Still...!

396
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,230
Why did Minato go so far

397
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:55,608
as sealing the Nine-Tails' chakra
into his own son?

398
00:28:55,724 --> 00:29:00,479
Who knows? Maybe it just turned out
that way by coincidence...

399
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:05,994
Or perhaps, as a parent, he wanted
to pass on the power to his son.

400
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:10,290
I know because I was Minato's teacher.

401
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,421
Hmm?

402
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:15,086
He never did anything without
good reason.

403
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:19,257
Minato must have known
something important.

404
00:29:19,464 --> 00:29:24,135
And he entrusted the Nine-Tails' power
to his own son because of that.

405
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:27,223
I think you're reading too much into it.

406
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,517
Do you really think so?

407
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:34,814
The Nine-Tailed Fox Demon that
attacked the Hidden Leaf Village long ago

408
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:37,967
is said to have been a natural disaster.

409
00:29:38,864 --> 00:29:44,537
Lately, I've begun to suspect
that it wasn't a natural phenomenon.

410
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:50,789
It may have been manually summoned.

411
00:29:50,858 --> 00:29:52,013
You fool!

412
00:29:52,104 --> 00:29:55,094
It's always been known that the Nine-Tails
is a natural disaster that mysteriously

413
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:57,538
appears whenever humanity
becomes steeped in evil!

414
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:00,398
Besides, there is no one
in this world powerful enough

415
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,717
to summon the likes of the Nine-Tails!

416
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:06,721
That's the thing.
There was one person.

417
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:07,764
Huh?!

418
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,728
The founder of the Uchiha Clan...

419
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:15,730
Madara Uchiha.

420
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:21,474
You fool! Madara Uchiha lived
during the era

421
00:30:21,499 --> 00:30:23,505
when the Hidden Leaf Village.
was established!

422
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,574
He wouldn't have been alive
fifteen, sixteen years ago!

423
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,243
Indeed.

424
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:32,035
And everyone knows

425
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:35,141
that the First Hokage defeated
Madara Uchiha at the Valley of the End.

426
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,877
So your theory is pointless.

427
00:30:39,076 --> 00:30:40,328
Perhaps...

428
00:30:40,913 --> 00:30:43,807
But I just have this feeling...

429
00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:48,113
that fills me with unease.

430
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:12,057
You return to the Leaf Village.

431
00:31:12,881 --> 00:31:17,458
When you get there, see Ibiki.
He already knows you're coming.

432
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,836
I'm counting on you...

433
00:31:26,712 --> 00:31:29,882
Now then, I hope this works.

434
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,474
Here I go!

435
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,248
Well?

436
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,160
It's Jiraiya.

437
00:31:52,882 --> 00:31:56,427
I see... Jiraiya-sensei, huh?

438
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,458
How nostalgic...

439
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,127
What'll you do, Pain?

440
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:04,797
He's not on our side, right?

441
00:32:05,226 --> 00:32:06,086
Probably not...

442
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:10,345
Then we'll kill him.
It's far too late for regrets.

443
00:32:10,767 --> 00:32:14,312
I came out in this body personally
to kill the intruder.

444
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:15,975
Take me to him.

445
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:16,920
All right.

446
00:32:23,437 --> 00:32:27,984
Pain... I'll handle him until you arrive.

447
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:32,158
Kill him if you can.

448
00:32:47,069 --> 00:32:48,570
<i>Fire Style: Flame Bombs!</i>

449
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:05,400
Toad Subjugation...
Shadow Manipulation Jutsu...?

450
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:10,238
I was hoping to lure out
a fellow named Pain,

451
00:33:10,378 --> 00:33:13,507
but little did I expect you
to take the bait.

452
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,496
You've honed your jutsu magnificently.

453
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,833
But even more,
you've become quite a catch, Konan!

454
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:26,629
I thought you had died...

455
00:33:26,867 --> 00:33:30,579
Instead, you turned into
a flimsy sheet of paper.

456
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:34,595
You're his messenger...
The Lady Angel!

457
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,305
And now, an angel?

458
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,182
Which means, Konan,

459
00:33:38,297 --> 00:33:41,383
you're the messenger for
this so-called god?

460
00:33:42,129 --> 00:33:43,830
This guy is an intruder!

461
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,273
You should kill him now!

462
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,233
Move away.

463
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,485
Y-Yes!

464
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,112
Who is Pain?

465
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:53,948
It's none of your business, Sensei.

466
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:08,464
And that makes you an angel...?

467
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:13,092
Does putting on an act like that
have its benefits?

468
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:16,971
I have received orders from our god.
I will kill you.

469
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,650
<i>Toad Oil Bombs!</i>

470
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:39,010
Can't spread your wings
with all that oil, can you?

471
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,912
You used to love origami,

472
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:44,707
and you were the kindest
among the three kids.

473
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,128
What became of the other two?

474
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,048
Nagato... and Yahiko?

475
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:55,426
I heard they had died.
Were they just rumors too?

476
00:34:57,303 --> 00:35:02,433
I see...
So this Pain is one of them, eh?

477
00:35:03,092 --> 00:35:06,829
What's your purpose? Appearing
before us after all these years...

478
00:35:07,127 --> 00:35:09,087
That wasn't my intention.

479
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:12,235
If you all hadn't been part
of the Akatsuki...

480
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:18,116
I heard that you had died.
I never expected this.

481
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:19,992
I bet now you're thinking...

482
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:24,099
You should've done what that
Orochimaru suggested back then...

483
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:28,668
You saved us instead.

484
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,628
But it's too late now...

485
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:34,298
We've embraced his ideology
and made our move.

486
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:40,012
I don't regret letting you live at all.

487
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,142
But I'm so disappointed...

488
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:49,355
I taught you ninjutsu to enable you
to live through those harsh times.

489
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,774
You were all, without a doubt,
my students.

490
00:35:52,034 --> 00:35:57,539
The world may still be a cruel place,
but to attack me without a greeting...

491
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,615
This is too sad.

492
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:04,745
For a few years after that time,
I heard your names mentioned.

493
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:08,284
You had made a reputation for
yourselves in a few confrontations,

494
00:36:08,309 --> 00:36:10,478
but I heard later that you had died.

495
00:36:11,254 --> 00:36:14,132
You know nothing about what happened
to us afterward.

496
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:19,302
No, I don't. But why the Akatsuki?!

497
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,638
What the Akatsuki is doing is wrong!

498
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,142
That is the decision I've made...

499
00:36:26,708 --> 00:36:28,210
Jiraiya-sensei.

500
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,319
You look very different.
But those eyes...

501
00:36:36,918 --> 00:36:40,547
So you were Pain... Nagato!

502
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,076
It seems you've strayed off
the path of good.

503
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:45,828
What happened?

504
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:50,541
You don't need to know.
After all, you are an outsider.

505
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,211
You've changed, Nagato.

506
00:36:55,016 --> 00:36:56,392
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

507
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:05,723
Whoa!

508
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:12,146
<i>Bubbles! Leave it to my student
to know my weakness!</i>

509
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,398
<i>He intends to wash away the oil.</i>

510
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,695
Konan, stay back.

511
00:37:26,185 --> 00:37:27,937
<i>Art of the Raging Lion's Mane!</i>

512
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:48,849
Nagato... I want to ask you a few things.

513
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,810
What happened to Yahiko?

514
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:55,523
Oh yeah...
There was such a guy, wasn't there?

515
00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:59,294
He died a long time ago.

516
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:03,030
What happened to you?
The old you wouldn't...

517
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,276
Nothing...

518
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,076
Just war.

519
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:14,166
Too many people die here.
That pain made me grow up.

520
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,294
What do you mean?

521
00:38:17,036 --> 00:38:21,762
Even a stupid, foolish kid will grow up
when he learns what pain is.

522
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:26,095
Knowing pain controls one's words
and thoughts.

523
00:38:26,306 --> 00:38:29,017
But abandoning one's love for a friend...

524
00:38:29,042 --> 00:38:31,252
Is that what it means
to become an adult?

525
00:38:31,617 --> 00:38:35,412
Sensei... You are still just a man.

526
00:38:36,054 --> 00:38:39,349
However, through this never-ending pain...

527
00:38:40,059 --> 00:38:42,378
I have matured and become
even more than a man.

528
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,612
What?

529
00:38:44,038 --> 00:38:46,207
Yes... From a man...

530
00:38:46,904 --> 00:38:48,113
to a god.

531
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:55,207
When one becomes a god,
your words and thoughts become absolute.

532
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,919
Sensei, since you are human

533
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:02,298
it can't be helped
if you don't understand what I'm saying.

534
00:39:02,391 --> 00:39:04,393
Have you become that twisted?

535
00:39:05,355 --> 00:39:09,735
Things I couldn't see when I was human
are clear to me now that I am a god.

536
00:39:10,697 --> 00:39:12,658
And being a god,

537
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:15,936
I realize that there are things
I can do which man cannot.

538
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:20,105
To put it simply, evolving beyond man.

539
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:22,860
Just what are you planning to do?

540
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:28,490
I am going to put an end to
this senseless, war-torn world.

541
00:39:29,366 --> 00:39:31,202
That is a god's work.

542
00:39:31,604 --> 00:39:34,607
If that is your purpose,
why are you gathering Tailed Beasts?

543
00:39:35,222 --> 00:39:37,474
You are going to die anyway.

544
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,461
So I shall tell you the true purpose.

545
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:47,301
I will use the Sealed Tailed Beasts...
to develop a new Forbidden Jutsu.

546
00:39:51,496 --> 00:39:54,207
With just one such jutsu,

547
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,936
a large nation can be
destroyed instantaneously.

548
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:59,881
It will be the most powerful,
the ultimate Forbidden Jutsu weapon.

549
00:40:00,429 --> 00:40:04,392
How will making such a thing
end the fighting?

550
00:40:04,746 --> 00:40:08,292
Won't it simply intensify the conflicts?

551
00:40:09,098 --> 00:40:11,434
There are disputes
throughout the nations.

552
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:16,247
How would you put a quick end
to them all, Jiraiya-sensei?

553
00:40:16,272 --> 00:40:20,109
That is my question to you!
Answer me!

554
00:40:20,466 --> 00:40:24,804
You give each warring nation
a Forbidden Jutsu weapon.

555
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:29,969
Once they possess such a power,
they are bound to use it.

556
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:31,762
What do you mean?

557
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:36,976
Tens of millions will die instantly...

558
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:39,279
and people will become scared.

559
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:43,391
People... and nations will learn
what pain is!

560
00:40:44,073 --> 00:40:47,952
That fear will breed a strong aversion
to war and the fighting will end.

561
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:53,868
It can be said that this world is still in
the process of growing and stabilizing.

562
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,636
Pain will make the world mature.

563
00:40:57,411 --> 00:41:00,581
In the same way that I matured.

564
00:41:01,303 --> 00:41:06,016
In order for the world to grow up
and become wiser

565
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:08,340
a god's hand is necessary.

566
00:41:08,665 --> 00:41:10,917
The world is still a child.

567
00:41:11,034 --> 00:41:14,644
Teach the world pain in order to
make it grow up...

568
00:41:14,669 --> 00:41:16,796
Do you believe that is your work?

569
00:41:17,128 --> 00:41:21,007
Yes... because I am the god of peace.

570
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:25,245
You've gotten good
at telling jokes... Nagato.

571
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:29,015
Joke? I'm not joking.

572
00:41:29,302 --> 00:41:31,012
My ideal is...

573
00:41:33,913 --> 00:41:35,414
Over here, Sensei.

574
00:41:36,208 --> 00:41:38,169
Is that you're next summoning?

575
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:44,210
To me, you are a small existence
which never matured.

576
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:48,285
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

577
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,468
A kid treating me like a kid!

578
00:41:52,493 --> 00:41:55,621
Well, I'm no longer human either!

579
00:41:55,849 --> 00:41:58,685
These tears of blood,
overflowing with rage!

580
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:03,340
I went from Sannin to Sage!
The Toad Sage of Mount Myoboku!

581
00:42:03,593 --> 00:42:05,846
I am Master Jiraiya...!

582
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:13,030
You haven't matured at all...
You're just as clumsy as before.

583
00:42:13,616 --> 00:42:18,454
Hey! Gamaken!
Don't wobble while I'm striking a pose!

584
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:27,336
<i>I'm kind of clumsy...</i>

585
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:31,257
Against this foe,
there shall be no playing by ear!

586
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:34,039
I'm coming at you with full force!

587
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,772
I'm summoning the two great sages!

588
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:50,943
However, it's going to take some time
to summon the two of them.

589
00:42:51,477 --> 00:42:53,938
And I cannot release my hands
during that time.

590
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:56,991
I'm counting on you.
Buy me some time until then!

591
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,578
<i>All right. Clumsy as I am, I shall try.</i>

592
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,753
He vanished. What a bother...

593
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,923
Where in the world did he find
such a creature?

594
00:43:13,603 --> 00:43:17,065
Now that he's made himself invisible,
we've got to use Barrier Battle Arts.

595
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:21,056
<i>Hmm... He's a hard one to battle.</i>

596
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:38,866
As I recall...

597
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:43,120
This is a barrier ninjutsu that senses and
alerts any intrusion across its boundary.

598
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:44,538
In that case...

599
00:43:54,209 --> 00:43:57,254
He saw the barrier and switched
to a strong offensive creature!

600
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:58,636
Mister Gamaken!

601
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:02,097
<i>Right! Clumsy as I am, here we go!</i>

602
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:15,819
You're quite skilled!

603
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:19,323
<i>Not at all... I am clumsy.</i>

604
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:21,575
What?!

605
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:45,391
Wh-What is this?!

606
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:57,004
Are you okay, Gamaken?

607
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:00,257
Can't you do this a bit more gracefully?

608
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:05,429
<i>But I am clumsy...</i>

609
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:09,850
They seem to multiply each time
you clobber them...

610
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,561
I don't even have a clue what it is...

611
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,774
Is this a self-replicating Summoning Jutsu?!

612
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:21,153
In any case,
we'd better move from this spot.

613
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:26,161
We'll kill one dog at a time!
Let's lure them into a small space.

614
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:27,493
<i>Right!</i>

615
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:50,641
<i>So that's the center of the jutsu...</i>

616
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,357
Were we able to lose it...?

617
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,651
That should buy us some time.

618
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:01,693
Or not!

619
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,881
We're surrounded already!

620
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,051
Incoming! And they're going
to split up again!

621
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:35,727
Above you!

622
00:47:49,069 --> 00:47:51,071
There's no end to this.

623
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,662
<i>I am trying my best...</i>

624
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:57,958
If they keep dividing,
no matter how hard we strike them,

625
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,793
it's a waste of our energy.

626
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:08,302
Here already?
Damn persistent dogs!

627
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:14,725
Stupid little...!

628
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:18,645
Are you all right?!

629
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:25,569
Gamaken!

630
00:48:29,429 --> 00:48:31,974
<i>I really am...</i>

631
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,369
<i>clumsy...</i>

632
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:47,799
If you can't move, Mister Gamaken...

633
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:51,011
then there's no time to summon
the two great sages.

634
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,263
I give up.

635
00:48:53,887 --> 00:48:56,389
But I'm amazed
there are so many of them...

636
00:48:58,749 --> 00:49:01,460
But against the Great Toad
of Mount Myoboku,

637
00:49:01,485 --> 00:49:03,446
you're all nothing but a small snack!

638
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:25,629
Gone... Along with the dogs.

639
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,006
So he's escaped for now.

640
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,633
I haven't escaped!

641
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:36,765
Nagato, you're still a novice.

642
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,934
Leaving your back open for an attack!

643
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,153
You're a Shadow Clone too?!

644
00:49:50,371 --> 00:49:52,081
Yes, but that's not all.

645
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,574
At the same time...
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

646
00:49:56,854 --> 00:49:58,147
Damn it!

647
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:18,112
Huh?

648
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:26,606
<i>It's one thing after another...</i>

649
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:29,026
<i>But I'm almost there.</i>

650
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,905
<i>So I can't quit now, but...</i>

651
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:35,966
<i>Incoming!</i>

652
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:43,874
Wha--?! So fast!!

653
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:05,437
I want to attack the caster,
but I need to be able to see him!

654
00:51:06,399 --> 00:51:09,152
Don't you think something
is strange, Gamaken?

655
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:12,069
<i>I-I am...</i>

656
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:16,656
<i>too clumsy to understand
what you mean.</i>

657
00:51:21,408 --> 00:51:24,954
<i>He who possessed the same eyes
as the Sage of the Six Paths,</i>

658
00:51:25,157 --> 00:51:28,351
<i>not only mastered every jutsu
I taught him...</i>

659
00:51:28,537 --> 00:51:31,967
<i>he demonstrated the ability to master
all chakra nature transformations.</i>

660
00:51:31,992 --> 00:51:34,433
<i>For a single person to do so
is unheard of.</i>

661
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:44,893
<i>He was well versed in
all the standard ninjutsu...</i>

662
00:51:45,407 --> 00:51:48,827
<i>and mastered them by the time
he was ten years old.</i>

663
00:51:53,314 --> 00:51:55,065
<i>But why...?</i>

664
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:01,493
<i>Why is he only using
the Summoning Jutsu against me?!</i>

665
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:04,875
<i>Does he think I am beneath
the need for direct confrontation?</i>

666
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:14,172
Gamaken! You've done enough!
I've got it from here, go home!

667
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:16,691
<i>All right. Thanks.</i>

668
00:52:44,355 --> 00:52:50,570
Whoa! Why do you always summon us
in such tight spots like this?!

669
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:53,503
It's no wonder Bunta gets so mad!

670
00:52:53,670 --> 00:53:00,844
Aw c'mon, Ma.
Naturally, Jiraiya-boy has his reasons.

671
00:53:00,869 --> 00:53:03,580
You be quiet, Pa!

672
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,515
It's been a while,

673
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:08,810
and I do apologize for calling you
under these circumstances, Pa, Ma.

674
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:14,316
But lad... I thought you said
you hated that form,

675
00:53:14,341 --> 00:53:18,220
saying it would make you unpopular
with the ladies!

676
00:53:19,492 --> 00:53:21,744
I can't afford to be particular right now.

677
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:25,035
After all, my foe has the Rinnegan.

678
00:53:26,164 --> 00:53:28,583
Ah... the Eyes of the Six Paths?!

679
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:31,333
Someone actually possesses
such an eye?

680
00:53:32,155 --> 00:53:35,032
Well then, you had no choice.

681
00:53:40,641 --> 00:53:46,981
You have to start being able to go into
Sage Mode by yourself, Jiraiya-boy.

682
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:50,727
Compared to you,
I'm still just a novice.

683
00:53:51,022 --> 00:53:53,650
So please lend me your aid
for just a little while...

684
00:53:56,873 --> 00:53:58,374
Shall we begin?

685
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:08,411
<i>He went through all that just
to summon those two toads...?</i>

686
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:11,873
<i>No, there is a transformation
going on with Sensei.</i>

687
00:54:12,203 --> 00:54:18,459
<i>Humph, whether it's Orochimaru or Jiraiya,
the Sannin each have unique powers.</i>

688
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:24,177
And? Where is the one with
the Eyes of Six Paths?

689
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:27,305
Your eyes must be degrading with age.

690
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:31,017
No. He's hidden himself inside
a summoning creature

691
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,852
that can make itself invisible.

692
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,439
It's have to be one of them
chameleon species.

693
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:39,734
I have erected a probe barrier.

694
00:54:39,774 --> 00:54:41,651
That won't do any good!

695
00:54:42,172 --> 00:54:45,300
Let's drag them out using
creature detection jutsu!

696
00:54:45,853 --> 00:54:51,692
Ma, don't get so excited,
you'll get more wrinkles.

697
00:54:51,805 --> 00:54:53,682
Just hush up, Pa!

698
00:54:54,090 --> 00:55:01,847
But why go so far as to summon us
to fight this fellow, Jiraiya-boy?

699
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:05,385
He happens to be
a former student of mine...

700
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:13,677
We never knew you had one!
Then is he...?

701
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:17,163
Yes...

702
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:19,107
Then why are you fighting him?

703
00:55:19,865 --> 00:55:23,743
It seems he did not grow up
in the right direction.

704
00:55:24,285 --> 00:55:27,538
And when I heard he had died...

705
00:55:28,257 --> 00:55:30,676
I thought he couldn't have been
the one.

706
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:35,165
In any case, if he is not righteous,
you must kill him.

707
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:39,252
Well, that senile old man probably
made up that prophecy.

708
00:55:39,277 --> 00:55:40,278
Don't worry about it!

709
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:42,283
All right let's do it!

710
00:55:50,003 --> 00:55:51,338
Found him!

711
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:56,209
It's fast!

712
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:02,317
Gotcha!

713
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:09,407
There we go!

714
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:12,433
Pa!

715
00:56:12,622 --> 00:56:13,623
I'm on it!

716
00:56:30,763 --> 00:56:32,473
That's the Rinnegan?

717
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:36,142
It certainly looks like the one mentioned
in the legend.

718
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:46,386
What nasty eyes... I can't
believe he's that child of prophecy.

719
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:49,072
<i>Great Lord Elder...</i>

720
00:56:50,139 --> 00:56:53,559
<i>I wonder if this is
that moment of selection?</i>

721
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,663
<i>Summoning Jutsu.</i>

722
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,800
<i>This time he's summoned humans.</i>

723
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:15,306
You turned out to be
a harbinger of destruction...

724
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:19,769
So as your mentor,
it is my duty to take you down!

725
00:57:27,683 --> 00:57:29,769
Three of them? What's going on?

726
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:32,157
How could there be three Rinnegans...?

727
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:36,101
It must be his jutsu...
There's some trick to it.

728
00:57:36,413 --> 00:57:39,208
Just when I was busy preparing dinner...

729
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:44,002
Ma, never mind that.
Just focus on the opponent before us!

730
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:45,962
What did you say?!

731
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:49,507
I guess it's about time
I made my move!

732
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:56,639
From this moment on,
let Sage Jutsu prevail!

733
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,809
Look above, upon the halos
and heavenly canopies!

734
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:02,770
Jiraiya the gallant--

735
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:05,440
- Stop shouting in my ears!
- Stop shouting in my ears!

736
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:08,067
Ugh! Uh...

737
00:58:08,187 --> 00:58:11,607
<i>My entrance pose keeps getting
interrupted today...</i>

738
00:58:13,298 --> 00:58:15,425
Let's end this quickly and go home!

739
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:17,785
I have to get dinner ready!

740
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:22,332
Ma, that guy's eye is
more important than dinner!

741
00:58:22,557 --> 00:58:26,060
Stay alert!
It's the ultimate ocular jutsu!

742
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,420
Like I care!

743
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:30,381
Don't you dare belittle
a housewife's dilemma

744
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:32,783
of what to cook every day,
you old geezer!

745
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:35,094
How dare you use such a tone
against me!

746
00:58:35,194 --> 00:58:37,531
I was just looking after you!

747
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:38,599
Don't give me that!

748
00:58:38,624 --> 00:58:43,129
<i>Who are the ones yakking into
whose ears again?</i>

749
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:55,365
Not bad...

750
00:58:57,951 --> 00:59:01,037
Now then... Can we put
your marital spat aside

751
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:03,081
and get this here over with?

752
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:06,334
Humph... Guess I'll just fry up something.

753
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:09,462
Boy, you provide the oil.
Pa, you bring the Wind Style!

754
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:10,547
Yes ma'am!

755
00:59:13,232 --> 00:59:14,859
<i>Sage Art: Bath of Boiling Oil!</i>

756
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:42,120
The oil vanished?

757
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:44,414
They ought to have been basted by it.

758
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:46,916
That one probably has tricks
up his sleeve too.

759
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:57,255
Shall we find out with close combat?

760
00:59:57,394 --> 00:59:58,156
Yes.

761
01:00:02,872 --> 01:00:05,625
<i>Massive Rasengan!</i>

762
01:00:13,211 --> 01:00:16,672
<i>He's...! He can absorb an entire jutsu?!</i>

763
01:00:16,697 --> 01:00:17,865
<i>So that's what he did earlier...</i>

764
01:00:18,117 --> 01:00:19,213
Behind us!

765
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:26,039
<i>We got his back!</i>

766
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,000
<i>What?!</i>

767
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:32,170
<i>He blocked my Sage Mode attack
without looking?!</i>

768
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:42,680
<i>Sage Art: Kebari Senbon!</i>

769
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:58,988
<i>Not a single wasted movement.</i>

770
01:00:59,270 --> 01:01:02,231
<i>I would've gotten him if he'd dodged it...</i>

771
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:06,829
<i>Instead, he blocked it by summoning
without ever turning around.</i>

772
01:01:07,562 --> 01:01:09,272
<i>What's going on?</i>

773
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:11,376
<i>Blocking my attacks not just once,
but twice!</i>

774
01:01:12,407 --> 01:01:14,784
<i>With no verbal signals or eye contact
between them at all...</i>

775
01:01:14,908 --> 01:01:17,870
<i>Even if all three were sensory types,</i>

776
01:01:18,058 --> 01:01:23,063
<i>they still have to see an attack
coming in order to counter it.</i>

777
01:01:23,808 --> 01:01:30,398
<i>Kebari Senbon is my fastest jutsu
with the widest attack range.</i>

778
01:01:31,427 --> 01:01:34,998
<i>The only way to defend oneself against
it is with a shield, as he just did.</i>

779
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,860
<i>And he did it without looking.</i>

780
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:41,489
<i>They're no ordinary clones.</i>

781
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:46,160
You said they have a trick up
their sleeves, and you're right.

782
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:47,286
Hmm?

783
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:48,663
Have you noticed?

784
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:49,956
What is it?

785
01:01:50,586 --> 01:01:52,879
When we got their back earlier,

786
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:56,087
you picked the target and attacked
from his blind spot, correct?

787
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:57,964
During that time,

788
01:01:58,005 --> 01:02:02,260
one of the other guys
was watching us the whole time.

789
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:05,555
I noticed that too.

790
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:07,536
But there were no signs that

791
01:02:07,561 --> 01:02:12,232
they were signaling each other
either verbally or with eye contact.

792
01:02:13,225 --> 01:02:17,150
That's it! It's their eyes...
All three have the same eyes!

793
01:02:17,783 --> 01:02:22,788
Suppose the three of them can
share what they see with each other...

794
01:02:23,273 --> 01:02:26,026
Enabling their eyes to share images
with one another...

795
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:28,519
Is that it?

796
01:02:28,901 --> 01:02:30,527
Yes. That's what I suspect...

797
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:34,542
Still... What in tarnation are they?

798
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:46,846
<i>This is bad...</i>

799
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:50,105
<i>Under these circumstances
where my ninjutsu are being nullified...</i>

800
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:52,841
<i>To face all three at once
is a bit too much.</i>

801
01:02:53,404 --> 01:02:55,239
<i>At this rate, if I enter battle...</i>

802
01:02:55,646 --> 01:02:58,399
<i>I'll be killed,
even in Sage Mode.</i>

803
01:02:59,391 --> 01:03:02,061
<i>I never imagined
they would be this strong...</i>

804
01:03:02,653 --> 01:03:04,739
Fall back for now, Jiraiya-boy.

805
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:05,948
Yes sir.

806
01:03:11,694 --> 01:03:14,238
He's escaped into the pipes...

807
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:18,419
Why are we running away?

808
01:03:18,663 --> 01:03:21,875
We need to analyze the
Six Paths technique and form a plan.

809
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:24,425
And we'll need some time for that.

810
01:03:25,548 --> 01:03:29,802
They may look different,
but all possessed the same eye.

811
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:34,143
In short, they all have
the Rinnegan of Six Paths...

812
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:37,897
Even if one of them is Nagato,

813
01:03:37,922 --> 01:03:41,634
I can't believe there would be
so many Rinnegan users crawling around.

814
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:44,445
So what in the world's going on?!

815
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,157
Which one is the real Pain?

816
01:03:48,449 --> 01:03:51,828
Figuring out the main one
isn't the problem.

817
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:55,300
The real problem is the fact that

818
01:03:55,325 --> 01:03:57,873
three of them possess
the Rinnegan of Six Paths.

819
01:03:58,456 --> 01:04:01,125
Which means we have to split them up
and fight each one separately.

820
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:04,257
I'm positive I can win one-on-one...

821
01:04:05,132 --> 01:04:07,301
Since they possess such eyes,

822
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:13,057
fighting as a team would have to
be their basic mode of attack.

823
01:04:14,455 --> 01:04:16,832
Taijutsu isn't going to work...

824
01:04:17,021 --> 01:04:20,483
and any ninjutsu will just be absorbed.

825
01:04:20,976 --> 01:04:25,064
If taijutsu and ninjutsu won't work,
then it'll have to be genjutsu.

826
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:25,999
Yes!

827
01:04:26,024 --> 01:04:29,569
But I am hopeless
when it comes to genjutsu.

828
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,327
Ah, but as I recall you two were...

829
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:37,790
Yes... If they're former students
of yours, Jiraiya-boy,

830
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:41,460
they know that you don't use genjutsu.

831
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:44,338
So that might give us an opening.

832
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:47,174
No way! I'm not going to do it!

833
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,968
Wh-What is it?!

834
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:55,975
World peace is hanging
on this battle, Ma!

835
01:04:56,428 --> 01:04:58,346
This is no time to be selfish!

836
01:04:58,477 --> 01:05:01,606
I don't care about no old geezer's
senile prophecies!

837
01:05:01,772 --> 01:05:06,068
The Great Lord Elder told us to
get along, remember?!

838
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:09,447
What is it that you
object to so much?

839
01:05:10,413 --> 01:05:14,176
I can't sing a duet with Pa
at this plump ripe old age!

840
01:05:14,201 --> 01:05:15,328
It's embarrassing!

841
01:05:15,536 --> 01:05:17,622
Huh? A duet?!

842
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:20,583
Our most powerful genjutsu
involves appealing

843
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:24,003
to the auditory senses of
the victim through song.

844
01:05:24,211 --> 01:05:28,716
Auditory senses? I see.
That's why we retreated.

845
01:05:29,408 --> 01:05:33,571
Correct... This genjutsu is powerful,
but as soon as we make a sound,

846
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:37,224
our whereabouts will be revealed,
which is its weakness.

847
01:05:38,026 --> 01:05:40,737
Also, there's the harmony
of the sounds...

848
01:05:40,843 --> 01:05:44,513
In other words, the genjutsu
is placed with a melody.

849
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:47,902
It requires a little time
before it takes effect.

850
01:05:48,634 --> 01:05:50,922
If they discover our whereabouts

851
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:54,992
before they are caught in the genjutsu
and attack, we will surely lose.

852
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:57,870
However, once they are caught
in the genjutsu,

853
01:05:57,912 --> 01:05:59,872
our victory will be assured.

854
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:11,676
What's wrong?

855
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:16,305
If both your lives are ever in danger,

856
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:18,766
I want you to free yourselves
from my shoulders immediately.

857
01:06:19,266 --> 01:06:20,977
Huh? Absolutely not!

858
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:25,106
The fate of the ninja world depends
on this battle!

859
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:29,527
I have a plan.
Although it is a gamble as well...

860
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:30,861
Do tell.

861
01:06:35,295 --> 01:06:36,922
Please begin...

862
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:38,119
- Right.
- Right.

863
01:06:58,097 --> 01:06:59,098
What is that?

864
01:07:04,168 --> 01:07:07,046
This is... the croaking of frogs...

865
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:11,360
Is this a genjutsu?!

866
01:07:16,657 --> 01:07:18,284
It's coming from in there.

867
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:35,051
<i>A Shadow Clone!</i>

868
01:07:37,136 --> 01:07:39,055
<i>Fire Style: Giant Flame Bombs!</i>

869
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,601
<i>So that's your move!</i>

870
01:07:44,471 --> 01:07:46,598
<i>Good! My gamble's a success!</i>

871
01:07:46,724 --> 01:07:48,199
<i>Just as I suspected,</i>

872
01:07:48,224 --> 01:07:53,063
<i>each of them possesses
only a single type of ability!</i>

873
01:07:57,990 --> 01:08:01,160
<i>Right now, the big fellow's eyes
are focused on the jutsu.</i>

874
01:08:03,085 --> 01:08:05,421
<i>One, I blinded earlier...</i>

875
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:10,461
<i>So only one of them...</i>

876
01:08:12,187 --> 01:08:13,814
<i>is looking at me!</i>

877
01:08:14,715 --> 01:08:15,758
<i>This one too!</i>

878
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:19,553
<i>Gotcha!</i>

879
01:08:21,722 --> 01:08:23,099
<i>I can't move.</i>

880
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:25,935
<i>The dark swamp?!</i>

881
01:08:28,024 --> 01:08:29,316
<i>Just a little more!</i>

882
01:08:32,858 --> 01:08:35,027
Now we're really one-on-one!

883
01:08:37,742 --> 01:08:39,577
I'm not letting you summon!

884
01:08:58,872 --> 01:09:00,165
You got us...

885
01:09:01,314 --> 01:09:04,776
You are inside a genjutsu paralysis
that binds your psyche.

886
01:09:05,472 --> 01:09:07,182
Now none of your bodies,

887
01:09:07,277 --> 01:09:09,446
including your main body,
will be able to move.

888
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:12,773
Jiraiya-sensei...

889
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:16,360
I didn't expect
a genjutsu like this from you.

890
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:19,113
I thought I taught you...

891
01:09:19,113 --> 01:09:23,242
Never let your guard down, no matter
who your opponent is, Nagato...

892
01:09:25,536 --> 01:09:27,913
You erred in your decision.

893
01:09:29,690 --> 01:09:31,650
<i>I just want to protect those two.</i>

894
01:09:33,123 --> 01:09:35,918
<i>No matter what kind of pain
I have to endure.</i>

895
01:09:40,922 --> 01:09:41,923
<i>I see.</i>

896
01:09:44,096 --> 01:09:46,599
Rather than rule the world
through pain...

897
01:09:46,807 --> 01:09:49,143
I wish you had moved past the pain and

898
01:09:49,168 --> 01:09:51,503
harnessed your power to bring
about peace in a positive way.

899
01:09:57,985 --> 01:10:01,655
For just a little while...
I believed you were the one.

900
01:10:05,262 --> 01:10:06,472
Farewell...

901
01:10:21,652 --> 01:10:23,195
Are you both all right?!

902
01:10:26,365 --> 01:10:30,077
This genjutsu is hard on the throat.

903
01:10:30,264 --> 01:10:36,812
It's real hard staying in sync with Pa...
This jutsu ain't that easy at all!

904
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,977
Damages the throat!
Stretches the lower jaw 'til it sags!

905
01:10:40,002 --> 01:10:41,003
Creates wrinkles!

906
01:10:41,223 --> 01:10:45,519
My profound apologies.
Please take your rest now.

907
01:10:46,784 --> 01:10:50,329
For I've made my selection.

908
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:58,295
Didn't you teach me to never
let down your guard... Jiraiya-sensei?

909
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:14,687
Lad! Your left arm!

910
01:11:14,712 --> 01:11:15,963
I'm aware of that...

911
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:18,023
What's going on?!

912
01:11:18,328 --> 01:11:21,123
This one's got a different face
than the other three...

913
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:25,656
He was probably summoned earlier.

914
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:29,994
I see! Before they got caught
in our genjutsu!

915
01:11:33,308 --> 01:11:34,521
Now then.

916
01:11:49,815 --> 01:11:52,693
In attendance...
The Six Paths of Pain.

917
01:11:54,768 --> 01:11:57,313
Six?! There are six of them?!

918
01:11:57,525 --> 01:12:02,530
Hey, look close!
The three we just did in are there too!

919
01:12:02,573 --> 01:12:05,784
The newly summoned ones
must have resurrected them

920
01:12:06,139 --> 01:12:07,904
with some sort of jutsu!

921
01:12:07,929 --> 01:12:11,683
There's even a jutsu that can revive
as many as three of them

922
01:12:11,803 --> 01:12:13,222
when they were undoubtedly dead?!

923
01:12:13,589 --> 01:12:16,008
Are they really human?!

924
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:21,837
Pain... What are you?!

925
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:23,429
Pain...

926
01:12:24,181 --> 01:12:27,810
That name is an alias that
denotes all six of us.

927
01:12:31,405 --> 01:12:32,906
Y-You're...!

928
01:12:33,974 --> 01:12:35,434
That face...

929
01:12:35,608 --> 01:12:39,118
What's going on?
I thought you said Yahiko died!

930
01:12:39,143 --> 01:12:40,520
Plus, those eyes...

931
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:43,776
You see Yahiko's image in me?

932
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:46,904
You really are his former Teacher.

933
01:12:47,738 --> 01:12:49,990
But Yahiko has been dead
for quite some time.

934
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:52,868
All that remains... is Pain.

935
01:12:52,893 --> 01:12:54,812
Stop speaking in riddles!

936
01:12:54,923 --> 01:12:57,217
Why do you possess the Rinnegan?!

937
01:12:57,333 --> 01:12:59,501
What are you talking about,
Jiraiya-boy?

938
01:13:00,125 --> 01:13:03,045
One of my former students
is among them.

939
01:13:03,253 --> 01:13:06,340
Except he didn't use to
possess those eyes...

940
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:08,634
What on earth is going on?

941
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:11,762
You're saying there are
two children of prophecy?

942
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:13,639
No, that's not it either...

943
01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:19,019
<i>When I saw the Rinnegan, I convinced
myself that the first one was Nagato...</i>

944
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:22,439
<i>But he's subtly different
from the Nagato I knew of...</i>

945
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:24,761
<i>Come to think of it,
upon closer inspection,</i>

946
01:13:24,786 --> 01:13:29,207
<i>none of those six remind me of Nagato.</i>

947
01:13:29,446 --> 01:13:32,533
<i>On the other hand,
one of them resembles Yahiko...</i>

948
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:35,494
<i>but possesses Nagato's Rinnegan...</i>

949
01:13:36,286 --> 01:13:39,790
<i>Are you Yahiko... or Nagato?</i>

950
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:42,835
Just what exactly are you?!

951
01:13:44,942 --> 01:13:46,027
We are God.

952
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:54,192
<i>God?!</i>

953
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:04,064
Yahiko! How could you possess
Nagato's eyes?!

954
01:14:04,393 --> 01:14:07,772
Even if you knew that,
you could not win!

955
01:14:37,764 --> 01:14:40,893
<i>This is... a barrier?</i>

956
01:14:48,052 --> 01:14:49,043
<i>Stomach acid?</i>

957
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:53,322
<i>Rasengan!</i>

958
01:15:12,799 --> 01:15:15,177
I barely managed to kill one...

959
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:17,304
only after dragging it into my barrier...

960
01:15:20,641 --> 01:15:21,975
Are you all right, lad?

961
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,145
Somewhat...

962
01:15:29,053 --> 01:15:30,096
My body...?!

963
01:15:30,584 --> 01:15:32,252
My chakra's agitated!

964
01:15:32,315 --> 01:15:33,296
<i>Is it this?!</i>

965
01:15:38,684 --> 01:15:43,564
Their true identity is a mystery,
and they seem to use strange weapons.

966
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:48,293
They're no longer mortals...
They're something entirely different.

967
01:15:51,910 --> 01:15:54,245
<i>No one really knows what
he looks like.</i>

968
01:15:54,523 --> 01:15:57,985
<i>And some claim that
he doesn't even exist.</i>

969
01:15:59,098 --> 01:16:03,436
<i>That face...
He is unmistakably Yahiko...</i>

970
01:16:07,568 --> 01:16:11,530
<i>And yet,
he possesses Nagato's Rinnegan...</i>

971
01:16:11,828 --> 01:16:15,582
<i>Did Yahiko steal them
from Nagato for some reason?</i>

972
01:16:15,779 --> 01:16:16,722
<i>But...</i>

973
01:16:17,447 --> 01:16:20,492
<i>There are other
Rinnegan bearers as well...</i>

974
01:16:20,784 --> 01:16:22,786
<i>So what's going on?</i>

975
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,123
<i>Plus...</i>

976
01:16:26,957 --> 01:16:32,671
<i>Understanding such pain enables you
to be kind to others...</i>

977
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:34,548
<i>That's what makes us human.</i>

978
01:16:35,019 --> 01:16:37,771
<i>What do you mean by that...?</i>

979
01:16:39,105 --> 01:16:41,649
<i>It's called growing up.</i>

980
01:16:42,782 --> 01:16:45,868
<i>Growing up? What do you mean?</i>

981
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:51,106
<i>That, you need to figure out yourself.</i>

982
01:16:52,456 --> 01:16:57,878
<i>Too many people die here.
That pain made me grow up.</i>

983
01:16:58,851 --> 01:17:03,856
<i>In which case,
does that mean he is Nagato?</i>

984
01:17:17,519 --> 01:17:19,646
That's right! Now I remember!

985
01:17:20,177 --> 01:17:22,512
This one is definitely not Nagato!

986
01:17:22,808 --> 01:17:23,892
What's the matter?

987
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:26,183
This fellow before us...

988
01:17:26,763 --> 01:17:29,349
I've fought him before.

989
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:32,481
He was a Fuma Clan member
I encountered

990
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:37,361
right after setting out on my journey,
following the Great Lord Elder's prophecy.

991
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:40,989
I gave him that scar on his forehead...

992
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:43,784
So what's a fellow like him
doing here?

993
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:47,479
Now I'm even more confused
about this whole Pain mystery.

994
01:17:49,948 --> 01:17:53,326
<i>You will guide that revolutionary.</i>

995
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:59,091
<i>The day will come when you will be
forced to make a critical selection.</i>

996
01:17:59,183 --> 01:18:01,728
<i>What must I do...?</i>

997
01:18:01,896 --> 01:18:03,565
<i>In order to make the right choice?</i>

998
01:18:03,859 --> 01:18:08,656
<i>In my dream, you traveled the world,
writing books.</i>

999
01:18:08,959 --> 01:18:11,962
<i>It can't be...
If this is the prophecy...</i>

1000
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:18,026
I wish to go back and face them
in order to confirm something...

1001
01:18:18,402 --> 01:18:20,320
You two please go back.

1002
01:18:20,487 --> 01:18:21,446
What?!

1003
01:18:21,502 --> 01:18:24,672
Absolutely not! You will be killed
if you go out again!

1004
01:18:24,819 --> 01:18:26,279
They have more eyes,

1005
01:18:26,524 --> 01:18:30,403
and they will not fall
for the barrier trap twice!

1006
01:18:30,694 --> 01:18:33,822
They're not on to us in here yet.

1007
01:18:34,169 --> 01:18:35,921
This is our only chance to
make a run for it!

1008
01:18:36,113 --> 01:18:39,783
I may be killed if I go out there...

1009
01:18:40,424 --> 01:18:44,219
But I may be able to learn
the truth about them.

1010
01:18:44,636 --> 01:18:46,096
If I let this chance slip by,

1011
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:50,058
I don't think there's anyone else
who could get as close to Pain.

1012
01:18:50,684 --> 01:18:53,103
This is our only chance to
uncover the truth...

1013
01:18:54,324 --> 01:18:55,459
Plus...

1014
01:18:55,981 --> 01:19:00,736
This is the time for selection
that the Great Lord Elder prophesied!

1015
01:19:01,139 --> 01:19:04,561
Boss and Ma'am... please take the
intel on Pain we've gathered so far,

1016
01:19:04,586 --> 01:19:07,380
as well as this corpse and go back.

1017
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,703
And please tell Tsunade...

1018
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:12,456
Ma should be enough for that.

1019
01:19:13,373 --> 01:19:14,499
But...

1020
01:19:14,556 --> 01:19:16,808
Just return by dinnertime.

1021
01:19:16,833 --> 01:19:21,045
Yup... When we're done here,
I'll bring Jiraiya-boy on over with me.

1022
01:19:27,387 --> 01:19:29,598
Thank you...

1023
01:19:58,502 --> 01:20:00,045
<i>It's just as I thought!</i>

1024
01:20:05,131 --> 01:20:08,635
<i>They're all ninja that
I've encountered before!</i>

1025
01:20:20,565 --> 01:20:21,854
<i>That's it!</i>

1026
01:20:21,879 --> 01:20:24,840
<i>I've figured out who Pain is!</i>

1027
01:20:29,157 --> 01:20:30,367
<i>My throat...</i>

1028
01:20:30,367 --> 01:20:31,368
Jiraiya-boy!

1029
01:20:31,743 --> 01:20:33,787
You were too late in figuring it out...

1030
01:20:45,757 --> 01:20:49,845
<i>I must let Boss know... about
Pain's true identity.</i>

1031
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:52,597
Hang in there, Jiraiya-boy!

1032
01:20:55,058 --> 01:20:58,937
<i>It's no good...
My throat has been crushed.</i>

1033
01:21:00,574 --> 01:21:03,368
<i>Damn it... At this rate...</i>

1034
01:21:06,335 --> 01:21:09,797
<i>It's useless... I'm passing out...</i>

1035
01:21:10,824 --> 01:21:14,404
<i>Am I... going to die?</i>

1036
01:21:16,496 --> 01:21:19,207
<i>Have I failed...?</i>

1037
01:21:31,636 --> 01:21:34,347
<i>It's not how you live,</i>

1038
01:21:34,795 --> 01:21:36,755
<i>but how you die in
the ninja world...</i>

1039
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:41,187
<i>A ninja's life is not measured
by how they lived</i>

1040
01:21:41,938 --> 01:21:45,567
<i>but rather what they managed
to achieve before their death.</i>

1041
01:21:46,544 --> 01:21:51,257
<i>Looking back, my life has
been nothing but failures...</i>

1042
01:21:52,699 --> 01:21:54,993
<i>Continually rejected by Tsunade...</i>

1043
01:21:55,755 --> 01:21:58,132
<i>Unable to stop my friend...</i>

1044
01:21:58,788 --> 01:22:01,875
<i>And unable to protect either
my student or my mentor...</i>

1045
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:06,463
<i>Compared to the great deeds
of the Hokage,</i>

1046
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:11,092
<i>my actions are trifling,
insignificant things indeed.</i>

1047
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:16,890
<i>I wish I could have died like
each of the Hokage.</i>

1048
01:22:17,891 --> 01:22:21,394
<i>A tale is only as good as
its final turn of events, the plot twist.</i>

1049
01:22:23,271 --> 01:22:25,357
<i>Failures must be seen
as mere amusements!</i>

1050
01:22:25,398 --> 01:22:29,611
<i>They are trials, which hone your skills.
I lived believing that...</i>

1051
01:22:30,487 --> 01:22:33,865
<i>And in return, I swore I would
accomplish a deed so great</i>

1052
01:22:33,865 --> 01:22:36,868
<i>that it would obliterate all
of my failures...</i>

1053
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:39,120
<i>And I'd die a splendid ninja!</i>

1054
01:22:39,815 --> 01:22:41,567
<i>At least, that's how it
was supposed to go...</i>

1055
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:45,877
<i>But... with my plot twist...</i>

1056
01:22:46,711 --> 01:22:49,005
<i>My tale, ending like this...</i>

1057
01:22:49,881 --> 01:22:55,136
<i>The Great Lord Elder prophesied that
I would guide that revolutionary.</i>

1058
01:22:55,523 --> 01:22:57,233
<i>A person who will make
a great choice</i>

1059
01:22:57,389 --> 01:23:02,435
<i>that will bring either stability
or destruction to the ninja world.</i>

1060
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:07,383
<i>I thought I would defeat Pain,
stop the Akatsuki,</i>

1061
01:23:07,523 --> 01:23:09,459
<i>and save the ninja world
from destruction...</i>

1062
01:23:09,484 --> 01:23:12,529
<i>But in the end, I failed in
that selection too.</i>

1063
01:23:13,321 --> 01:23:15,156
<i>How pitiful...</i>

1064
01:23:15,448 --> 01:23:19,821
<i>that this will be the twist to
"The Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant."</i>

1065
01:23:21,235 --> 01:23:23,571
<i>What a worthless story...</i>

1066
01:23:24,823 --> 01:23:29,117
No, I don't think so.
This tale is wonderful!

1067
01:23:29,734 --> 01:23:31,816
I really hope my unborn child

1068
01:23:31,841 --> 01:23:34,927
can become a ninja just
like this main character!

1069
01:23:35,804 --> 01:23:40,183
Which is why I'd like your permission
to name my son after him.

1070
01:23:41,215 --> 01:23:42,300
<i>Yes...</i>

1071
01:23:43,460 --> 01:23:44,878
<i>That's right...</i>

1072
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:47,939
<i>I gave that child...</i>

1073
01:23:49,899 --> 01:23:52,318
<i>I'm going to become the Hokage!</i>

1074
01:23:52,318 --> 01:23:56,406
<i>A Hokage that surpasses
all previous Hokage!</i>

1075
01:23:57,365 --> 01:24:03,121
<i>I never go back on my word...
That's my ninja way!</i>

1076
01:24:06,843 --> 01:24:08,011
<i>Naruto...</i>

1077
01:24:09,031 --> 01:24:10,616
<i>Now that I think about it, Naruto,</i>

1078
01:24:10,641 --> 01:24:13,477
<i>you are just like that
novel's main character.</i>

1079
01:24:14,799 --> 01:24:19,679
<i>You've inherited Minato and
Kushina's wishes, their hopes...</i>

1080
01:24:21,028 --> 01:24:23,760
<i>And yet... I...</i>

1081
01:24:24,537 --> 01:24:26,331
<i>You are my sensei!</i>

1082
01:24:26,372 --> 01:24:29,000
<i>And you are a great ninja who
possesses the true talent of a ninja!</i>

1083
01:24:29,147 --> 01:24:31,524
<i>There's no other like you.</i>

1084
01:24:33,651 --> 01:24:38,406
A ninja is one who endures,
one who stands brave.

1085
01:24:39,207 --> 01:24:41,418
Let me teach you one thing...

1086
01:24:41,829 --> 01:24:44,415
The most important attribute
of a ninja

1087
01:24:44,446 --> 01:24:47,407
is not the number of jutsu he masters.

1088
01:24:47,695 --> 01:24:49,405
The most important thing is...

1089
01:24:50,171 --> 01:24:52,841
the guts to never give up!

1090
01:24:54,342 --> 01:25:00,640
<i>Never go back on your word
and never give up...</i>

1091
01:25:01,117 --> 01:25:04,662
<i>Naruto, if that is your ninja way...</i>

1092
01:25:04,908 --> 01:25:07,219
<i>Then as your mentor...</i>

1093
01:25:07,244 --> 01:25:10,205
<i>I have no business whining.</i>

1094
01:25:10,852 --> 01:25:16,357
<i>For everyone knows that a student
inherits his ninja way from his teacher!</i>

1095
01:25:16,986 --> 01:25:21,658
<i>Isn't that so, Naruto?!</i>

1096
01:25:23,493 --> 01:25:24,702
Jiraiya-boy!

1097
01:25:27,631 --> 01:25:30,468
I was sure his heart had stopped.

1098
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:33,962
Got it!

1099
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:44,305
<i>Never give up...</i>

1100
01:25:44,477 --> 01:25:49,774
<i>That was the true choice
I was supposed to make!</i>

1101
01:25:50,495 --> 01:25:52,371
Quite obstinate, isn't he?

1102
01:25:53,106 --> 01:25:54,232
Let's finish him off.

1103
01:25:55,483 --> 01:25:59,112
All right! Message received!

1104
01:25:59,549 --> 01:26:02,885
<i>A dying message...
He wrote it in code, eh?</i>

1105
01:26:06,703 --> 01:26:11,207
<i>Naruto... You are the child of prophecy,
I'm sure of it now.</i>

1106
01:26:12,083 --> 01:26:15,357
<i>I entrust you with the rest!</i>

1107
01:26:28,297 --> 01:26:31,592
The frog... got away.

1108
01:26:37,567 --> 01:26:40,778
<i>"The Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant"...</i>

1109
01:26:41,237 --> 01:26:44,407
<i>Now it'll end a bit better I hope.</i>

1110
01:26:45,310 --> 01:26:47,437
<i>The final chapter will be...</i>

1111
01:26:47,619 --> 01:26:52,665
<i>"The Frog within the Well...
Drifts into the Great Ocean."</i>

1112
01:26:55,251 --> 01:26:58,922
<i>Not bad... Not bad at all...</i>

1113
01:27:00,580 --> 01:27:04,834
<i>Now... It's about time
I put down my pen...</i>

1114
01:27:05,803 --> 01:27:10,767
<i>Ah, that's right!
What should I name the sequel?</i>

1115
01:27:12,485 --> 01:27:13,903
<i>Let's see...</i>

1116
01:27:16,814 --> 01:27:19,442
<i>"The Tale of Naruto Uzumaki."</i>

1117
01:27:19,467 --> 01:27:22,637
<i>Yes... That has a nice ring to it...</i>

1118
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:04,792
One of the legendary Sannin...
Jiraiya is no more...

1119
01:29:06,395 --> 01:29:10,733
If we didn't have this secret,
we could not have won.

1120
01:29:11,516 --> 01:29:13,977
Let us praise him as our teacher.

1121
01:29:15,195 --> 01:29:17,948
By the way...
you can come out.

1122
01:29:20,976 --> 01:29:22,603
Sure took you a while.

1123
01:29:22,726 --> 01:29:25,854
<i>His opponent was Jiraiya,
after all.</i>

1124
01:29:26,306 --> 01:29:28,183
That was quite a struggle.

1125
01:29:28,664 --> 01:29:32,292
I'm under orders from Madara
to capture the Nine-Tails.
