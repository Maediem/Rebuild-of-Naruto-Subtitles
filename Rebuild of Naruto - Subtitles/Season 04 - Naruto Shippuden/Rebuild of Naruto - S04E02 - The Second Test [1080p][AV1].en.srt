1
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:24,807
<i>For the next three days, I'm going to
give it everything I've got...</i>

2
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,501
<i>for Lord Gaara.</i>

3
00:00:39,627 --> 00:00:42,796
Lord Gaara, putting up
your Sand Guard won't help you train!

4
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:46,587
Sorry... My Sand Guard is
an automatic response

5
00:00:46,612 --> 00:00:48,280
and I'm not conscious of it.

6
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,468
Your Sand is like armor.

7
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:52,927
Even if your armor is solid,

8
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:57,015
you'll sustain damage if
your taijutsu is weak.

9
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:02,353
You must stay on the offensive
and maintain your breathing.

10
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,493
Then your body will move naturally.

11
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:11,571
Now try defending yourself even
before your Sand Guard activates.

12
00:01:27,328 --> 00:01:28,955
I am impressed, Lord Gaara.

13
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:32,128
You've progressed so much
in such a short time.

14
00:01:33,054 --> 00:01:35,932
Once you master taijutsu,
you will be able to combine it

15
00:01:35,957 --> 00:01:38,292
with your Sand Guard and
make it even more formidable.

16
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,433
It's only because I have
such a fine teacher.

17
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:44,140
Shira, are you going to
take the Chunin Exam?

18
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:51,597
Yes. I'm eternally grateful for
the opportunity you have given me.

19
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:54,988
It's only natural since
you have the skills.

20
00:01:56,366 --> 00:02:01,162
In time, you will become
a great shinobi of the Sand.

21
00:02:03,743 --> 00:02:06,412
It's finally here! The Chunin Exam!

22
00:02:06,886 --> 00:02:08,888
I'm getting antsy.

23
00:02:09,674 --> 00:02:11,467
It's too soon to get nervous.

24
00:02:12,872 --> 00:02:16,041
Our goal isn't simply to
pass the Chunin Exam...

25
00:02:16,796 --> 00:02:20,174
But to have as many Sand entrants
as possible pass.

26
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,252
It's my way of
repaying Lord Gaara.

27
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:28,378
I think you're more stressed out
than we are.

28
00:02:29,757 --> 00:02:32,844
I want to live up to
Lord Gaara's expectations.

29
00:02:35,034 --> 00:02:39,811
By the way, this year's second test
is shorter than last time.

30
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:43,674
It's three days this time
as opposed to five days.

31
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:48,948
Which simply means this place
is that much more dangerous.

32
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,531
When the sun rises,
the temperatures soar in the desert.

33
00:02:52,908 --> 00:02:55,494
And getting around will
become much more difficult.

34
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,051
I see...

35
00:02:57,076 --> 00:03:01,289
We might have barely
enough time to make it to the goal.

36
00:03:01,366 --> 00:03:03,285
So we can't stop for anything.

37
00:03:03,714 --> 00:03:07,551
Anyway, our priority is
to acquire the other scroll.

38
00:03:08,244 --> 00:03:10,621
To do that, we'll have
to battle a team for it...

39
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,234
But we can't just pick any team.

40
00:03:14,317 --> 00:03:15,860
I came up with something.

41
00:03:16,326 --> 00:03:17,327
When did you...?

42
00:03:18,172 --> 00:03:21,550
Yesterday's brawl in the cafeteria
was a fortunate turn of events.

43
00:03:22,531 --> 00:03:25,701
I was able to get a rough idea
of the other teams' strengths.

44
00:03:30,698 --> 00:03:32,145
The teams to watch are...

45
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:36,215
the one with Shira,
the guy who stopped your kick, Lee.

46
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,041
And...

47
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,478
The team from the Hidden Waterfall.

48
00:03:49,261 --> 00:03:50,222
With our skills,

49
00:03:50,247 --> 00:03:52,499
we should have no problem
with the rest of the teams.

50
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,442
You're amazing, Neji!

51
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,720
You analyzed all that already?!

52
00:03:56,906 --> 00:03:58,825
So we'll avoid the strong teams

53
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,519
and aim for the weaker ones, right?

54
00:04:00,771 --> 00:04:04,316
I don't like doing things that way...

55
00:04:05,185 --> 00:04:08,104
I figured you'd say that.

56
00:04:08,492 --> 00:04:11,287
But we've waited two and a half years
for this Chunin Exam.

57
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,302
You don't want to fail, do you?

58
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,507
Of course not...

59
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,841
<i>But I...</i>

60
00:04:22,214 --> 00:04:24,216
<i>Determination never betrays you.</i>

61
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,182
<i>I...</i>

62
00:04:27,328 --> 00:04:29,080
<i>I want to fight that guy!</i>

63
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,570
There's the signal to start.

64
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:40,713
Let's go!

65
00:05:02,645 --> 00:05:04,021
So, what do we do?

66
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,726
We were told not to enter
the Demon Desert...

67
00:05:10,349 --> 00:05:12,059
I have a message
from Lady Tsunade.

68
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:21,796
What is it?

69
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:23,823
I'll read it.

70
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:28,036
"According to intel from agents
who just returned,"

71
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:31,205
"opposition forces have been
on the move recently"

72
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,332
"in the Land of Wind."

73
00:05:32,357 --> 00:05:34,735
<i>In other words, it's the
anti-Gaara faction.</i>

74
00:05:35,776 --> 00:05:38,695
<i>An assassination attempt
has already occurred.</i>

75
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:41,360
<i>In spite of this, supervisors from
other villages are prohibited</i>

76
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,135
<i>from entering the Demon Desert...</i>

77
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:48,215
<i>and Gaara himself intends to supervise
the second test as a proctor.</i>

78
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:51,768
<i>Needless to say,
the danger is enormous</i>

79
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:54,824
<i>if Gaara plans to
set himself up as a decoy.</i>

80
00:05:55,594 --> 00:05:58,806
<i>Not only to Gaara,
but to the Hidden Leaf.</i>

81
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:02,568
<i>If anything happens to Gaara,</i>

82
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:05,783
<i>our alliance with the Hidden Sand
will be jeopardized.</i>

83
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:08,999
<i>Guy... Asuma... Kurenai...</i>

84
00:06:09,408 --> 00:06:12,828
<i>Sneak into the Demon Desert
and investigate the Hidden Sand.</i>

85
00:06:13,637 --> 00:06:17,933
"If Gaara's safety is threatened,
protect him!"

86
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,027
Gaara's assassination...?

87
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,633
Gaara himself is the decoy...?

88
00:06:24,512 --> 00:06:27,598
The Hidden Sand must be
at their wit's end...

89
00:06:28,332 --> 00:06:31,043
Whatever happens,
let's protect the Kazekage!

90
00:06:31,594 --> 00:06:32,595
– Right.
– Yes.

91
00:06:33,299 --> 00:06:34,300
Scatter!

92
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,304
Your eyesight is amazing.

93
00:06:52,941 --> 00:06:55,027
Imagine being able to see
what's being reflected

94
00:06:55,052 --> 00:06:57,388
on a water droplet dozens
of kilometers away.

95
00:06:57,806 --> 00:06:59,666
Once she gets a fix
on the relay point,

96
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:01,276
she can see several
dozen kilometers out.

97
00:07:01,804 --> 00:07:04,974
But when the sun is out,
the water droplets evaporate,

98
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,884
so I can't use it for too long.

99
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,334
Found them!

100
00:07:09,472 --> 00:07:10,932
That's the team from
the Hidden Leaf!

101
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:13,719
The Hidden Sand is close by too!

102
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,903
Tell them to keep their distance.

103
00:07:17,273 --> 00:07:18,049
Right.

104
00:07:24,266 --> 00:07:25,601
It's a signal from Shira.

105
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,156
Well? Do you see anyone?

106
00:07:30,525 --> 00:07:31,901
Nope, there's no one.

107
00:07:32,155 --> 00:07:35,492
There has to be.
We've run quite far.

108
00:07:38,773 --> 00:07:40,357
<i>What's going on?</i>

109
00:07:42,386 --> 00:07:45,055
<i>Why can't I find anyone
with my Byakugan?</i>

110
00:07:46,141 --> 00:07:49,144
Neji, Tenten... Come here!

111
00:07:50,787 --> 00:07:52,247
What is it, Lee?

112
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,960
I'm positive this is my kunai.

113
00:08:01,477 --> 00:08:02,478
What?!

114
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:08,687
Just in case we got lost,
I stuck a few kunai into the rocks.

115
00:08:08,712 --> 00:08:10,755
Finding this means...

116
00:08:12,491 --> 00:08:14,827
We've been running
around in circles...

117
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,068
Could this be a genjutsu?

118
00:08:17,093 --> 00:08:20,262
No way! We haven't even
encountered an enemy yet!

119
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,382
<i>– Release!
– Release!</i>

120
00:08:35,897 --> 00:08:36,690
I knew it...

121
00:08:36,872 --> 00:08:38,206
What's going on?!

122
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,160
<i>There!</i>

123
00:08:41,414 --> 00:08:42,498
I found them!

124
00:08:45,553 --> 00:08:46,346
Let's hurry!

125
00:08:46,371 --> 00:08:47,747
According to Shira,

126
00:08:47,908 --> 00:08:50,035
there are some pesky
Leaf shinobi nearby!

127
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:53,959
Why should we listen
to a guy like that?!

128
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:56,653
He's useful to us now.

129
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:00,289
We can pay him back later...
As much as we want!

130
00:09:02,232 --> 00:09:03,650
Damn... They found us!

131
00:09:04,405 --> 00:09:06,824
We don't need to be nice
to these guys, right?

132
00:09:07,472 --> 00:09:08,931
We'll take their scroll!

133
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,341
– Right!
– Right!

134
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,163
Here I go!

135
00:09:15,196 --> 00:09:16,405
<i>Leaf...</i>

136
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,351
<i>Whirlwind!</i>

137
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:23,896
Datsuji! Goji!

138
00:09:26,361 --> 00:09:29,197
You're already within my range.

139
00:09:30,212 --> 00:09:32,631
And I will deal with you swiftly.

140
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,682
<i>Eight Trigrams...</i>

141
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:35,992
<i>Two Palms!</i>

142
00:09:38,052 --> 00:09:38,844
<i>What?!</i>

143
00:09:39,022 --> 00:09:40,023
<i>4 Palms!</i>

144
00:09:41,357 --> 00:09:42,358
<i>8 Palms!</i>

145
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,493
<i>16 Palms!</i>

146
00:09:45,568 --> 00:09:46,652
<i>32 Palms!</i>

147
00:09:48,811 --> 00:09:50,312
<i>64 Palms!</i>

148
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,306
<i>He blocked every hit?!</i>

149
00:09:59,787 --> 00:10:00,788
Shira!

150
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,811
We'll handle them.

151
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,013
Leave while you can.

152
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:10,151
I can't believe I get
to fight you so soon!

153
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,971
Hey! What are you
so happy about?!

154
00:10:13,248 --> 00:10:15,167
Lee! Don't take him on carelessly!

155
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:16,478
Oh, my...

156
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:19,753
The cactus genjutsu
was broken already?

157
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,662
<i>Cactus genjutsu?</i>

158
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,171
Back then, I did catch
the faint scent of plants...

159
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,590
That was the genjutsu?

160
00:10:33,196 --> 00:10:34,823
We knew the second test

161
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:37,803
would take place in the Demon Desert.

162
00:10:38,397 --> 00:10:41,400
So we set up several jutsu in advance.

163
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:43,976
Don't hold it against us...

164
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,585
that we have an advantage.

165
00:10:46,782 --> 00:10:48,909
But not this time!

166
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,941
I don't know about that.

167
00:10:52,296 --> 00:10:53,964
I'm very cautious.

168
00:10:54,575 --> 00:10:56,714
So I wonder what it means...

169
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:57,990
that I appeared before you?

170
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:00,993
Huh?!

171
00:11:01,057 --> 00:11:01,891
What?!

172
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:02,912
I can't move...

173
00:11:02,937 --> 00:11:04,189
Not again?!

174
00:11:06,398 --> 00:11:08,858
This time, I'll release it for you.

175
00:11:09,526 --> 00:11:10,527
<i>Release!</i>

176
00:11:15,682 --> 00:11:18,852
Sorry, but I don't have time
to deal with you guys now.

177
00:11:19,296 --> 00:11:20,547
Please wait!

178
00:11:22,503 --> 00:11:25,673
Shira! Why won't you fight me?

179
00:11:26,469 --> 00:11:30,598
You're strong. I knew that
the moment I took your hit.

180
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:33,684
That's why I won't fight.

181
00:11:34,435 --> 00:11:36,687
If we fight, one of us will get hurt.

182
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,940
A shinobi fights regardless of the risk!

183
00:11:40,441 --> 00:11:42,568
I have an important goal right now.

184
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:46,406
That goal is to make sure

185
00:11:46,447 --> 00:11:48,991
Hidden Sand entrants
make it through the test.

186
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:51,536
You're helping...

187
00:11:51,702 --> 00:11:52,703
... other entrants?

188
00:11:53,162 --> 00:11:54,176
Instead of asking questions,

189
00:11:54,201 --> 00:11:56,328
you should worry about yourselves.

190
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,584
Let's go, Sen, Yome.

191
00:12:00,514 --> 00:12:01,307
Shira!

192
00:12:01,546 --> 00:12:03,089
This sand... is moving!

193
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:07,360
Help me, Lee!

194
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,770
Wait... I can't get loose...!

195
00:12:10,638 --> 00:12:12,849
Don't struggle!
You'll get buried even deeper!

196
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,213
It seems I miscalculated
our strategy.

197
00:12:17,831 --> 00:12:19,207
What do you mean?

198
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:20,773
Last night...

199
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:26,195
He was also analyzing
the Hidden Leaf's strengths.

200
00:12:33,578 --> 00:12:35,955
They've had us under
surveillance from the start!

201
00:12:36,946 --> 00:12:38,490
Not only that,

202
00:12:38,562 --> 00:12:41,648
he took command of the
other Hidden Sand entrants,

203
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:44,755
and ordered them not
to confront us.

204
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:48,384
That's why we didn't
come across anyone!

205
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:52,239
That Shira is not only skilled...
he's smart!

206
00:12:52,691 --> 00:12:55,026
This is not the time
to be impressed!

207
00:12:55,051 --> 00:12:57,262
Can't you hear this noise?

208
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:03,210
Damn, so this is what
he was talking about!

209
00:13:03,235 --> 00:13:04,737
We're going to fall!

210
00:13:06,438 --> 00:13:07,522
We're going to die!

211
00:13:07,744 --> 00:13:09,162
We're going to die!

212
00:13:09,227 --> 00:13:11,938
<i>Eight Inner Gates:
Gate of Rest!</i>

213
00:13:11,963 --> 00:13:12,964
<i>Open!</i>

214
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:26,532
Is everyone okay?

215
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:28,475
Yeah, we made it.

216
00:13:28,887 --> 00:13:30,847
But where are we?

217
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,818
There's no way out
of this waterfall.

218
00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:41,549
What?!

219
00:13:41,574 --> 00:13:43,743
So we have to wait until
someone comes to rescue us?!

220
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:47,368
No way! Does that mean
we're disqualified?!

221
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:54,416
Is everyone safe?

222
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:55,634
What about them?

223
00:13:55,846 --> 00:13:56,930
We took care of them.

224
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,713
They fell into the Sand Waterfall Pit.

225
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,550
They won't be able to get out
until after the test is over.

226
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,386
I see. That's a relief.

227
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:09,640
Now's our chance. Get scrolls
from the other teams.

228
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,690
Yeah, and we're taking
one right now.

229
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,400
What's the big idea?

230
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,402
Like we said.

231
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,847
We're going to get one
from you guys.

232
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,489
Why?!

233
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,992
That's easy to answer, Shira.

234
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,477
Because we don't like you.

235
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,541
What did you want to talk about?

236
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,711
We want to help
and make sure everyone passes.

237
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,741
Your team and ours will
start out close to each other

238
00:14:41,766 --> 00:14:43,268
for the second test.

239
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,884
However, a Hidden Leaf team

240
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,011
that includes a Byakugan user
will also be near.

241
00:14:47,536 --> 00:14:48,537
They are strong.

242
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:50,764
So what?

243
00:14:51,132 --> 00:14:53,468
The chances are high
that one of our teams

244
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:56,605
will confront the Hidden Leaf
team in the beginning.

245
00:14:57,886 --> 00:14:59,596
This team is not
to be taken lightly.

246
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,735
We'll impede them.

247
00:15:03,712 --> 00:15:05,087
During this time,

248
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,239
I want you to get as far away
from them as possible.

249
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:12,953
Oh... In other words,
you're going to order us around?

250
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,874
I just want as many Sand shinobi
as possible to pass. That's all.

251
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,544
That's my way of
repaying Lord Gaara!

252
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,632
Lord Gaara, huh...?

253
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,004
That just doesn't sit well
with us.

254
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:31,972
That a guy like you
who wasn't a shinobi until just recently...

255
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,910
caught Lord Gaara's eye
and has the nerve

256
00:15:33,935 --> 00:15:36,230
to act all high and mighty
towards us!

257
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:40,272
Do you realize Shira
saved you earlier?!

258
00:15:40,988 --> 00:15:43,032
Well, we don't owe him...

259
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,277
a damn thing!

260
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:46,946
Wait!

261
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,491
I have no intention
of fighting you!

262
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,911
Maybe not you... but we sure do!

263
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,999
You're just too good
with the fan...

264
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,044
Using it even in combat to
control your genjutsu powder.

265
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,547
But without it,
you're no match for me.

266
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:10,386
You squirmy little—!

267
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,558
<i>I learned from Shira too!</i>

268
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,852
<i>I can use this Evasion Jutsu
better than anybody!</i>

269
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,190
<i>I know your moves like
the back of my hand!</i>

270
00:16:24,415 --> 00:16:25,499
However...

271
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:28,988
Your weakness is...
your eyes that see too well!

272
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,952
I-idiot?

273
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,663
Idiot!

274
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:46,021
My eyes... My eyes!

275
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:48,799
Yome!

276
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,634
Sen! Yome!

277
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,265
Don't move!

278
00:16:56,976 --> 00:16:59,187
If you do, we'll shoot!

279
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:12,740
Shira!

280
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,283
It's over, Shira!

281
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,870
Don't ever show your face again!

282
00:17:18,231 --> 00:17:19,232
Die!

283
00:17:19,901 --> 00:17:22,320
<i>Leaf... Hurricane!</i>

284
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,542
<i>Rotation!</i>

285
00:17:39,569 --> 00:17:40,570
You guys are—!

286
00:17:41,129 --> 00:17:42,805
Shira and his team are useless.

287
00:17:43,239 --> 00:17:44,616
But with the six of us...

288
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,482
Sorry, but we're out of here.

289
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,941
What?!

290
00:17:50,407 --> 00:17:51,408
Let's retreat!

291
00:17:57,239 --> 00:17:59,115
Shira! Are you all right?!

292
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,622
You...

293
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:04,917
Why...?

294
00:18:05,472 --> 00:18:08,475
I thought you fell into
the Sand Waterfall Pit?

295
00:18:10,136 --> 00:18:12,078
Oh, that was nothing.

296
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,655
Y-You're pretty good.

297
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,991
But why did you save us?

298
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,785
We're not so shameless

299
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,454
as to torment opponents
who have been weakened.

300
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,873
Anyway, thank you.

301
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,210
Can you explain something?

302
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,755
Why would your own comrades
do this to him,

303
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,048
who protected them?

304
00:18:53,456 --> 00:18:58,377
Well... Shira wasn't a shinobi
until just recently.

305
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,431
Wasn't a shinobi?

306
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,475
Someone of his skill?

307
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,979
Perhaps that's due to
his circumstances.

308
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,648
Do you know something, Lee?

309
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:15,487
Shira has almost no skill
in ninjutsu or genjutsu.

310
00:19:17,439 --> 00:19:19,566
Shira and I are alike...

311
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,537
We're shinobi who can
only perform taijutsu.

312
00:19:27,851 --> 00:19:30,062
So you knew.

313
00:19:34,045 --> 00:19:37,382
I realized it yesterday
when we exchanged punches.

314
00:19:42,305 --> 00:19:46,226
Those who are skilled in ninjutsu
and genjutsu may not notice

315
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,428
that slight, yet unique difference.

316
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,204
I sensed that he was like me.

317
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,858
Since you know that much,
let me explain.

318
00:19:53,898 --> 00:19:56,859
In the Hidden Sand Village,
not even the previous Kazekage

319
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:59,840
would allow people like Shira
to become shinobi.

320
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:03,660
But that's—! Even a great taijutsu user
like Shira?!

321
00:20:04,852 --> 00:20:07,938
That's right. That's
why until just recently...

322
00:20:08,224 --> 00:20:11,853
<i>Shira wasn't allowed to attend the Academy
and was treated like an outsider.</i>

323
00:20:17,328 --> 00:20:20,247
Hey! What are you staring at?
You can't even use ninjutsu!

324
00:20:23,977 --> 00:20:27,302
Go away! Your uselessness is contagious!

325
00:20:36,725 --> 00:20:40,603
<i>But Shira refused to give up
and believed in himself.</i>

326
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,597
<i>He kept training all by himself
and honed his taijutsu.</i>

327
00:21:07,248 --> 00:21:09,334
<i>Then, the times changed...</i>

328
00:21:09,895 --> 00:21:11,939
<i>The seat was empty for a while</i>

329
00:21:11,964 --> 00:21:14,425
<i>after the Fourth Kazekage
passed away...</i>

330
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:17,331
<i>but eventually Lord Gaara
became the Fifth Kazekage.</i>

331
00:21:18,086 --> 00:21:20,505
<i>Those who knew Lord Gaara's past</i>

332
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:23,074
<i>spread rumors that
our village was doomed,</i>

333
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,682
<i>but that wasn't the case.</i>

334
00:21:28,172 --> 00:21:31,341
<i>Lord Gaara was receptive
to other people's opinions...</i>

335
00:21:31,366 --> 00:21:34,203
<i>and one by one, he did away with
the previous Kazekage's practices</i>

336
00:21:34,228 --> 00:21:36,230
<i>and instituted reforms.</i>

337
00:21:40,193 --> 00:21:41,611
That's Lord Gaara?

338
00:21:42,525 --> 00:21:45,194
Yeah. He's the younger brother
of Temari,

339
00:21:45,283 --> 00:21:47,243
the girl we used to play with
when we were kids.

340
00:21:55,306 --> 00:21:59,393
What happened to the huge boulder
that was used to prevent sand erosion?

341
00:22:00,158 --> 00:22:02,035
Well...

342
00:22:12,252 --> 00:22:14,421
Bring me the one
who destroyed this.

343
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,190
Are you Shira?

344
00:22:22,815 --> 00:22:24,901
You knew that boulder
was placed there

345
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,178
to protect the Hidden Sand Village.

346
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:28,344
Why did you destroy it?

347
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:30,112
I am very sorry.

348
00:22:30,665 --> 00:22:32,458
I had no intention of
destroying it.

349
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:37,589
To me, that boulder was
an invaluable training partner.

350
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,500
Are you saying you destroyed it
during training?

351
00:22:41,089 --> 00:22:44,175
I was told you are not
a student at the Academy.

352
00:22:44,927 --> 00:22:45,928
No.

353
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:49,575
I don't have any skills in
ninjutsu or genjutsu.

354
00:22:50,644 --> 00:22:52,229
According to the village rules,

355
00:22:52,451 --> 00:22:56,163
someone like me is unfit
to be a shinobi.

356
00:22:56,761 --> 00:22:59,848
So you trained all by yourself?

357
00:23:01,337 --> 00:23:02,547
Interesting...

358
00:23:12,678 --> 00:23:15,723
I want to see which
is more valuable...

359
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:18,091
That boulder or you!

360
00:23:43,167 --> 00:23:44,960
Your fist is splendid!

361
00:23:46,544 --> 00:23:47,545
Please forgive me!

362
00:23:48,236 --> 00:23:51,697
I can't begin to imagine
the effort it took for you,

363
00:23:52,239 --> 00:23:55,230
banned from the Academy, to hone
your skills to this level.

364
00:23:55,957 --> 00:23:59,197
I hereby abolish the rule established
by my predecessor.

365
00:23:59,866 --> 00:24:02,035
Shira, you will be a shinobi.

366
00:24:06,152 --> 00:24:11,073
I once met someone just like you
in the Hidden Leaf Village.

367
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:15,954
Through sheer perseverance,
he has become a fine shinobi.

368
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:21,960
Shira, I predict you will become
as good a shinobi as he.

369
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:30,093
That's how Shira finally
became a shinobi.

370
00:24:30,951 --> 00:24:33,204
Not only that...

371
00:24:33,229 --> 00:24:35,231
Lord Gaara recognized
Shira's character and

372
00:24:35,256 --> 00:24:37,717
chose him to be
his personal taijutsu coach.

373
00:24:37,908 --> 00:24:41,787
To be named the Kazekage's
taijutsu coach is a huge advancement!

374
00:24:41,845 --> 00:24:45,766
But this displeased many.

375
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:51,175
When someone who until just recently
was below your rank

376
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,120
attains great success,
people become jealous...

377
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:55,827
I understand now.

378
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:59,298
Changing people's perceptions
takes time.

379
00:24:59,736 --> 00:25:02,947
I see, so that's why Shira
said that to me...

380
00:25:04,677 --> 00:25:07,180
<i>I don't know what it is you sensed,</i>

381
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:10,283
<i>but dwelling on the misfortunes
of birth is meaningless.</i>

382
00:25:11,157 --> 00:25:14,619
<i>Because, for all one's flaws
and suffering, we have just one life.</i>

383
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:19,895
Shira, you persevered
so much, and yet...

384
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:23,839
I'll never forgive the ones
who did this to you!

385
00:25:25,588 --> 00:25:26,364
Lee!

386
00:25:26,904 --> 00:25:29,740
That idiot... Don't tell me he's going to...

387
00:25:52,783 --> 00:25:53,826
This is—!

388
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,146
Damn it...

389
00:26:05,341 --> 00:26:09,011
If you guys hadn't run off,
we could've obtained a scroll.

390
00:26:09,622 --> 00:26:13,500
That team with the Byakugan user
is the one Shira warned us about.

391
00:26:13,768 --> 00:26:15,603
Better safe than sorry.

392
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,579
By the way, they're not coming
after us, are they?

393
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,331
I used all those paper bombs,

394
00:26:23,681 --> 00:26:27,143
and that area has a lot
of underground caverns...

395
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:29,538
The explosions created
a steeper cliff than I expected.

396
00:26:29,563 --> 00:26:32,399
It'll take them a while
to make their way across.

397
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,967
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

398
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:35,133
Who's there?!

399
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,892
The Beautiful Green Beast of
the Hidden Leaf, Rock Lee!

400
00:26:43,701 --> 00:26:45,204
You're that guy from earlier!

401
00:26:45,532 --> 00:26:48,035
What you did to Shira
is unforgivable!

402
00:26:48,435 --> 00:26:50,187
Please apologize to Shira!

403
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:52,502
Apologize to Shira?

404
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:56,706
This guy's from the Hidden Leaf and
he's siding with Shira?!

405
00:26:56,833 --> 00:26:58,918
When you believe
in hard work and perseverance,

406
00:26:58,943 --> 00:27:00,861
it doesn't matter whether
you're a friend or foe!

407
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:03,597
That's beside the point!
How did you get across that chasm?!

408
00:27:03,806 --> 00:27:07,055
I have invisible wings known
as perseverance!

409
00:27:07,742 --> 00:27:11,027
Until you apologize to Shira,
my rage will not subside!

410
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,923
Like hell, we will!

411
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:15,008
We know your weakness!

412
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:17,479
<i>Wind Style:</i>

413
00:27:17,504 --> 00:27:19,089
<i>Sandstorm Hurricane!</i>

414
00:27:33,063 --> 00:27:34,022
This is genjutsu!

415
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,696
Like Shira, you only specialize
in taijutsu.

416
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,698
So we'll just capitalize
on your weaknesses!

417
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:40,116
That's cowardly!

418
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,786
Please fight me fair and square!

419
00:27:47,348 --> 00:27:48,808
What's cowardly?!

420
00:27:49,006 --> 00:27:51,467
It's your fault for not knowing ninjutsu!

421
00:27:52,673 --> 00:27:54,633
<i>Inside the Sandstorm Hurricane,</i>

422
00:27:54,945 --> 00:27:57,281
<i>countless sand particles
collide against each other</i>

423
00:27:57,306 --> 00:27:58,975
<i>and create powerful
electromagnetic waves.</i>

424
00:27:59,010 --> 00:27:59,969
<i>Because of that,</i>

425
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:03,598
<i>anyone caught inside it will continue
to experience genjutsu.</i>

426
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:06,142
It's about time to finish this!

427
00:28:08,692 --> 00:28:09,328
What?!

428
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:15,860
Neji!

429
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:19,790
Hey, are you crazy taking
on six of them by yourself?

430
00:28:19,815 --> 00:28:23,069
Tenten! You two made it
across too!

431
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:26,139
If you made it, isn't it obvious
we would too?!

432
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,166
Damn it...

433
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:35,255
We're a team!
Don't go off on your own!

434
00:28:36,084 --> 00:28:39,253
I'm sorry! I just couldn't stand it...

435
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:41,369
Well, we have no choice now.

436
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:42,790
Let's go, Tenten!

437
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,222
That's more like it!

438
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,683
<i>8 Trigrams... 64 Palms!</i>

439
00:28:59,809 --> 00:29:00,851
What's their deal?

440
00:29:01,136 --> 00:29:02,429
They're ridiculously strong!

441
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:05,936
I would like some payback as well!

442
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:08,246
<i>Great Leaf Whirlwind!</i>

443
00:29:08,271 --> 00:29:09,272
Wait, Lee!

444
00:29:11,404 --> 00:29:12,780
Please forgive them.

445
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,421
Shira...!

446
00:29:15,192 --> 00:29:16,151
Why?

447
00:29:16,474 --> 00:29:18,101
Why would you defend them?!

448
00:29:18,221 --> 00:29:21,433
They betrayed you and
put you through hell!

449
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,804
Maybe they did.
But it doesn't matter.

450
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,308
How can you say
it doesn't matter?!

451
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:31,060
If they won't acknowledge me,
I have only myself to blame.

452
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,062
That's all.

453
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:37,859
I already told you.

454
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,944
Whatever my flaws
and misfortunes,

455
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:42,147
this is the life I was born into.

456
00:29:42,668 --> 00:29:46,463
I'm not bitter, and I bear no grudge.

457
00:29:47,058 --> 00:29:49,602
Good or bad, this is my life.

458
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:53,124
I have only myself to blame
for the bad

459
00:29:53,372 --> 00:29:54,748
because I didn't work hard enough.

460
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:58,838
I don't want to blame anyone
for the life I have.

461
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,133
Shira...

462
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:05,178
How can you say
you didn't work hard enough?

463
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:13,353
Shira! You are a man among men!

464
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:15,172
The shinobi among shinobi!

465
00:30:15,197 --> 00:30:17,657
I've never been so moved
in my life!

466
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:22,153
Other than Guy-sensei,
I've never met anyone so amazing!

467
00:30:22,743 --> 00:30:24,798
You get so carried away.

468
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,575
It was really touching,
until you ruined the mood.

469
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,166
Take this.

470
00:30:35,248 --> 00:30:38,293
This way, at least one of
our teams will pass.

471
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:43,007
Damn it... Must you be so kind?

472
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,510
Put yourself in our shoes, will you?

473
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:46,803
Sorry.

474
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,429
Why are you apologizing?

475
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:50,682
You're right.

476
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:54,435
But if you take this,
what about you guys...?

477
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:57,388
We'll figure something out.

478
00:30:58,126 --> 00:30:59,627
Why would you go so far?

479
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,484
Is it all for Lord Gaara?

480
00:31:03,521 --> 00:31:07,191
Until recently, he was
a brutal shinobi who'd kill anyone.

481
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,284
People don't change so easily!

482
00:31:10,055 --> 00:31:11,265
I realize that.

483
00:31:12,014 --> 00:31:14,892
But Lord Gaara and I
are the same...

484
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,083
That's what I believe.

485
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:20,461
I can tell from training with him.

486
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:24,382
Lord Gaara bitterly regrets
his past actions.

487
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:29,345
And he knows that atonement
won't come easy.

488
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:34,976
And yet, Lord Gaara keeps
pushing forward.

489
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,228
Because despite what
people think of him...

490
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:42,775
he believes that persevering
is the best thing to do right now.

491
00:31:43,545 --> 00:31:45,756
I don't care about
who I am right now...

492
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:49,032
As long as I'm not ashamed of
the man I am in the future.

493
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,780
Such profound words!

494
00:31:54,213 --> 00:31:55,238
You're absolutely right!

495
00:31:55,263 --> 00:31:58,600
What counts is the man
that you are in the future!

496
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:01,502
Okay, okay...
We heard you, pipe down!

497
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,213
We... can't accept that.

498
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:09,177
Hey, give him your scroll.

499
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:17,810
Why?!

500
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,313
We have our pride too.

501
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,274
We lost this battle.

502
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,443
So we're handing you our scroll.

503
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:31,783
But we're not about
to give up just yet.

504
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:35,078
We'll prove it by obtaining the scrolls
from the other teams.

505
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:36,996
Let's go!

506
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,833
Why did they...?

507
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:46,297
They realized that they don't want to
be ashamed of the person they'll become.

508
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,637
Shira!

509
00:32:55,593 --> 00:32:56,594
Um...

510
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,018
Thank you.

511
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:04,232
Thanks to you, it looks like Shira will
have a place in the Hidden Sand.

512
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,068
We didn't do anything.

513
00:33:07,421 --> 00:33:12,342
Shira did it with his own strength and
a little help from our taijutsu fanatic.

514
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:16,160
He's very earnest...
He might be a little like our Shira.

515
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,245
Uh, I don't think so.

516
00:33:17,898 --> 00:33:21,402
His weird clothes, his hair,
or his eyebrows...

517
00:33:21,918 --> 00:33:23,419
They're not alike at all!

518
00:33:24,021 --> 00:33:27,066
That's true... He's right up there
with Naruto in stupidity.

519
00:33:27,563 --> 00:33:28,564
Naruto?

520
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:32,093
A shinobi from our village.
He's on a training journey right now.

521
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,679
We've heard of him.

522
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:38,182
Lord Gaara speaks of a shinobi
who changed him.

523
00:33:38,914 --> 00:33:40,457
I'm sure the name was Naruto.

524
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:45,815
I wonder what he's up to now?

525
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,030
Neji... Tenten...

526
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:55,450
This has nothing to do
with the second test...

527
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:56,534
But I have a favor to ask.

528
00:33:56,844 --> 00:33:59,680
Uh-oh... Here we go...

529
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:06,502
I never want to go through
something like last time!

530
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:13,051
<i>Sasuke beat Gaara of the Sand
against whom I was no match...</i>

531
00:34:13,582 --> 00:34:17,918
<i>And Naruto beat Neji
whom I longed to defeat...</i>

532
00:34:19,488 --> 00:34:21,824
<i>Why? Why does it always
turn out like this?</i>

533
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:26,230
You wouldn't have listened to us
even if we tried to stop you, right?

534
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,482
Right!

535
00:34:28,307 --> 00:34:31,060
Shira! I want to fight you!

536
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:35,740
Because we both seek
to master taijutsu, please fight me!

537
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:37,784
If I can face you in battle,

538
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:41,162
I'll have no regrets about
this Chunin Exam!

539
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:44,332
Fine with me, Lee.

540
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:47,502
To be honest, I've wanted to fight you!

541
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:01,599
Huh?!

542
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,483
I didn't know Lee kept going
with that training.

543
00:35:11,315 --> 00:35:13,368
<i>We're in the middle
of the Chunin Exam!</i>

544
00:35:13,732 --> 00:35:14,816
<i>What is he thinking?</i>

545
00:35:17,517 --> 00:35:20,312
Shira! I will show
you how serious I am!

546
00:35:22,486 --> 00:35:23,779
Let me warn you...

547
00:35:23,841 --> 00:35:25,634
Shira's incredibly strong!

548
00:35:32,968 --> 00:35:34,928
I've become strong too!

549
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:38,594
This is my last fight.

550
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,304
Last?

551
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,420
Here I come, Lee!

552
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:55,653
What is this?
Their speed is ridiculous!

553
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,239
A battle of powerful fists...

554
00:35:58,487 --> 00:36:00,614
It's not something
you get to see often.

555
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,744
<i>If I could, I would have liked
to fight him too.</i>

556
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,456
<i>Amazing...</i>

557
00:36:07,571 --> 00:36:09,490
<i>I haven't faced
a taijutsu user this strong</i>

558
00:36:09,515 --> 00:36:11,050
<i>since Guy-sensei and Neji!</i>

559
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,337
<i>He has a fine technique...</i>

560
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:15,798
<i>I feel his passion in
every punch he throws.</i>

561
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:19,260
<i>The intensity of his training
comes across clearly.</i>

562
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:29,854
Lee!

563
00:36:29,913 --> 00:36:31,623
I'm grateful to you.

564
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:37,945
Perhaps it's all because of you
that I can be a shinobi.

565
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:42,300
Lord Gaara said
this to me back then...

566
00:36:43,811 --> 00:36:48,775
<i>I once met someone just like you
in Hidden Leaf Village.</i>

567
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:54,295
<i>Through sheer perseverance,
he has become a fine shinobi.</i>

568
00:36:55,399 --> 00:36:59,862
<i>Shira... I predict you will be
as good a shinobi as he.</i>

569
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:06,974
It might have been your fists
that changed Lord Gaara.

570
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,894
No, I had nothing to do with that!

571
00:37:11,702 --> 00:37:14,872
It was your perseverance
that moved Lord Gaara.

572
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,904
Lee, I'm going to show you
my gratitude in earnest!

573
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,280
Well said!

574
00:37:21,421 --> 00:37:22,755
That is the creed of those of us

575
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,324
who are dedicated to
the mastery of taijutsu.

576
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,802
They seem to be enjoying this.

577
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:31,999
Maybe Lee has met someone
he can consider a true rival.

578
00:37:35,591 --> 00:37:38,261
Neither one of them has delivered
a decisive blow yet.

579
00:37:38,524 --> 00:37:40,818
They're just sizing
each other up right now.

580
00:37:41,163 --> 00:37:42,080
What?

581
00:37:42,105 --> 00:37:44,274
They're not fighting at
their full potential?

582
00:37:44,761 --> 00:37:46,304
It's more like 50%.

583
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:49,100
How much can a body endure?

584
00:37:49,138 --> 00:37:50,598
If they stay evenly matched like this...

585
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:51,686
No...

586
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,146
They're not quite equal.

587
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,190
Huh? They're not?

588
00:37:56,421 --> 00:38:00,384
They're equal in speed and in
the number of moves they have...

589
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:03,906
But Shira's physique is
a full size bigger than Lee's.

590
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:06,826
In boxing, the difference
in body weight

591
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:08,395
influences the intensity of the blow.

592
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,371
While they may look
evenly matched,

593
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,865
Lee with his smaller build...

594
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,433
Is sustaining more damage?

595
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:17,378
Lee should be feeling
the effects pretty soon.

596
00:38:18,989 --> 00:38:22,159
<i>Blow for blow, Shira's punches
are harder than mine!</i>

597
00:38:22,184 --> 00:38:23,185
<i>At this rate...</i>

598
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,390
Lee!

599
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,322
That stance!

600
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:46,782
Don't tell me Lee plans
to use the Lotus!

601
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,034
It's too dangerous!

602
00:38:48,405 --> 00:38:51,623
<i>But he is an opponent
worthy of that risk!</i>

603
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,806
<i>No way!
The First Gate won't open!</i>

604
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,099
<i>Why?!</i>

605
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:24,862
You hit my chakra points and
stopped the flow of chakra!

606
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:26,572
As a taijutsu user like you,

607
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,783
I know all your strengths
and weaknesses.

608
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,369
As well as the fact that you are
versed in the secret jutsu,

609
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,536
the Eight Inner Gates!

610
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:36,207
From now on, I'm serious!

611
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,253
Shira's demeanor has changed.

612
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,342
He's getting serious now!

613
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:52,223
Here I come, Lee!

614
00:39:57,402 --> 00:39:58,417
What's happening?!

615
00:39:58,536 --> 00:40:01,330
All of a sudden, his attacks
became relentless and accurate!

616
00:40:01,356 --> 00:40:02,357
This is—!

617
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:07,738
The sound!

618
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:08,864
Sound?!

619
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,242
His attacks are silent!

620
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:15,663
We taijutsu users can
counter supersonic moves

621
00:40:15,797 --> 00:40:17,674
because we have honed
our five senses.

622
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,126
One of those senses is hearing.

623
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:21,669
I remember...

624
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:25,089
Lee said he once fought a shinobi
from the Hidden Sound

625
00:40:25,114 --> 00:40:27,074
who gave him a hard time!

626
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:30,136
This time, it's the exact opposite!

627
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,430
Shira is making absolutely no noise!

628
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:34,306
But how...?

629
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,016
<i>Byakugan!</i>

630
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:42,481
I see!

631
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,316
It's the theory of the owl.

632
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:45,985
The owl?

633
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:49,238
Did you know that owls fly
without making a sound?

634
00:40:50,994 --> 00:40:53,580
Owls have special
comb-like feathers

635
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:55,786
that muffle the sound
of their flapping wings.

636
00:40:57,913 --> 00:41:00,249
Using chakra that can only
be used with taijutsu,

637
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,376
he's cloaked himself with
the same type of feathers.

638
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:06,464
To come up with something
like that all by himself...

639
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:10,217
It's a shame someone like him
is an enemy.

640
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,476
<i>Silent Fist!</i>

641
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:20,352
See if you can take this, Lee!

642
00:41:21,436 --> 00:41:22,397
<i>How can I...?</i>

643
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:27,485
<i>There's no point in working hard
if you don't believe in yourself!</i>

644
00:41:28,794 --> 00:41:33,132
<i>Yes! I've trained and worked
just as hard as Shira!</i>

645
00:41:34,104 --> 00:41:37,691
999... 1000!

646
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,334
Now, 1000 sit-ups!

647
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:46,670
Are you serious?

648
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:47,963
I am serious!

649
00:41:47,988 --> 00:41:49,614
Wait, wait, wait!

650
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,926
Enough bodybuilding!

651
00:41:52,202 --> 00:41:55,872
You're in far better physical
condition than we are, Lee.

652
00:41:57,245 --> 00:42:01,416
But Guy-sensei, I've never beaten
you or Neji even once!

653
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,355
That's because
you don't use this.

654
00:42:04,516 --> 00:42:06,935
Use my head for taijutsu?

655
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:08,331
Certainly!

656
00:42:09,233 --> 00:42:11,015
It can be said that
mental visualization

657
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,583
is a fundamental part of taijutsu.

658
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:16,938
When I weave a sign,
I'm already seeing 100 moves ahead.

659
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:20,579
What?! Is such a thing possible?!

660
00:42:21,026 --> 00:42:22,027
Yes, it's possible!

661
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:26,852
Through visualization alone,
if I'm going to fight Kakashi,

662
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,630
I can now see 1000 moves ahead.

663
00:42:30,268 --> 00:42:31,396
Th-That far?

664
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:39,474
Hey, is that true?

665
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:40,641
Who knows?

666
00:42:42,299 --> 00:42:46,428
For example, if I attack
with a right seiken fist...

667
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:49,913
Lee, what would your 50th move be?

668
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:51,819
Huh?

669
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:54,863
What technique is your 50th move!

670
00:42:55,535 --> 00:42:56,953
Well...

671
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:58,993
Let's see...

672
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:01,231
A right thrust!

673
00:43:01,256 --> 00:43:02,299
Wrong!

674
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:06,458
Then... A clockwise kick!

675
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:07,960
Correct!

676
00:43:08,268 --> 00:43:09,561
So what is your 100th move?!

677
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:13,757
Uh... A left heel kick!

678
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:14,842
Wrong.

679
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,219
The answer is
a counter-clockwise kick.

680
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,596
What?

681
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,099
I will prove it to you right now!

682
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:24,351
Ready?

683
00:43:38,304 --> 00:43:39,597
48...

684
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:40,911
49...

685
00:43:41,063 --> 00:43:42,064
50.

686
00:43:43,513 --> 00:43:44,430
Continue!

687
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,707
Sensei was right!

688
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:56,592
98... 99...!

689
00:43:57,372 --> 00:43:58,373
100!

690
00:43:58,543 --> 00:43:59,544
Right again!

691
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,138
I see...

692
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,140
He's making that happen!

693
00:44:03,498 --> 00:44:04,210
Huh?

694
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:11,857
That's amazing, Guy-sensei!

695
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:13,275
What's your trick?

696
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:14,902
It's not a trick.

697
00:44:15,271 --> 00:44:18,814
I simply guided your movements.
That's all.

698
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,450
Guided my movements?

699
00:44:22,322 --> 00:44:23,115
Yes!

700
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:27,144
I used counters that forced you
to react in a certain way.

701
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:30,292
In battle, there is a sequence
to techniques and jutsu.

702
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,211
When you are in control
of that flow,

703
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,338
predicting what comes next
is not difficult.

704
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:38,217
Right now, I'm controlling
the flow of battle, and as a result,

705
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,302
you, my opponent who's physically
stronger than me,

706
00:44:40,327 --> 00:44:41,745
have tired out before me!

707
00:44:42,636 --> 00:44:43,637
That's true!

708
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,225
Guy-sensei, you're not
even breathing hard!

709
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,644
By controlling the flow of battle,

710
00:44:48,772 --> 00:44:52,442
I was able to deplete your energy
while preserving my own.

711
00:44:52,851 --> 00:44:55,979
There really aren't many chances to
take down a foe in the midst of battle.

712
00:44:56,276 --> 00:45:00,280
Most attack strategies are just attempts
to create such an opening!

713
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:03,554
That's what I mean
by using your head!

714
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,786
<i>That's right!</i>

715
00:45:06,041 --> 00:45:09,753
<i>From opponents I've faced before,
I pretty much know Shira's pattern.</i>

716
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:13,335
<i>All I need to do is control the sequence
of my opponent's moves.</i>

717
00:45:14,097 --> 00:45:16,217
<i>Then, even if his moves are silent,</i>

718
00:45:16,287 --> 00:45:18,622
<i>I can anticipate Shira's fist!</i>

719
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:23,887
All right!

720
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,055
What?!

721
00:45:26,893 --> 00:45:29,062
Lee's not getting hit anymore!

722
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:32,688
Finally, Lee...
You remembered that training!

723
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:38,193
<i>He's countering so fast!</i>

724
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:40,988
<i>I can't wait to see him go all out!</i>

725
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,750
<i>He missed the chakra point!</i>

726
00:45:53,867 --> 00:45:54,993
<i>What's going on?</i>

727
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:56,503
<i>Was it by chance?</i>

728
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:01,425
<i>At this point...</i>

729
00:46:01,484 --> 00:46:03,360
<i>Guy-sensei would be able to activate
the Sixth Gate instantly...</i>

730
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:05,179
<i>That's impossible for me, however...</i>

731
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,895
<i>Gate of Life! Open!</i>

732
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:22,196
He went straight to
the Third Gate...

733
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,491
So Lee's trained that far!

734
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:30,288
<i>So that's the rumored
Eight Inner Gates...</i>

735
00:46:31,241 --> 00:46:32,242
Well then...

736
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:39,254
<i>Seven Heavenly Breaths:
First Activation!</i>

737
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,213
<i>Second Activation!</i>

738
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,428
<i>Third Activation!</i>

739
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:48,972
What is that?!

740
00:46:49,003 --> 00:46:52,173
It's a taijutsu breathing method
that Shira came up with.

741
00:46:52,701 --> 00:46:54,661
It's a jutsu whereby inhaling
large amounts of oxygen

742
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:56,396
invigorates the entire body.

743
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:59,107
When performing this technique,

744
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:01,777
Shira's lung capacity increases
nearly fourfold.

745
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:05,739
So it's his version of
the Eight Inner Gates.

746
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:08,158
It's amazing that he came up
with that all by himself...

747
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:11,328
Those two really drive home the fact...

748
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:14,289
that there is no limit
to perseverance.

749
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:15,666
No kidding!

750
00:47:16,435 --> 00:47:18,019
Lee! Shira!

751
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:19,337
Do your best, both of you!

752
00:47:23,112 --> 00:47:24,405
Here I come, Shira!

753
00:47:25,893 --> 00:47:26,894
Anytime!

754
00:47:31,689 --> 00:47:32,774
<i>Not yet!</i>

755
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,228
<i>Fourth Gate of Pain! Open!</i>

756
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:39,314
<i>Gate of Closing! Open!</i>

757
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:56,127
<i>So this is what you're like
when you're serious!</i>

758
00:47:56,665 --> 00:48:00,210
<i>My chakra... the sound-muffling
feathers are being blown away!</i>

759
00:48:00,395 --> 00:48:03,815
I'm starting to hear...
the sound of your wings.

760
00:48:07,734 --> 00:48:09,736
<i>Leaf Hurricane!</i>

761
00:48:24,104 --> 00:48:25,146
I'm not done yet...

762
00:48:32,598 --> 00:48:34,100
Shira's wound has opened up!

763
00:48:34,359 --> 00:48:35,360
Shira!

764
00:48:36,023 --> 00:48:37,024
Shira!

765
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,917
Are you okay, Shira?!

766
00:48:40,942 --> 00:48:41,743
Yeah...

767
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:49,217
I guess we'll have to
postpone this match.

768
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:55,682
Lee, I envy you.

769
00:48:57,117 --> 00:49:00,412
I wish I could have trained under
Guy-sensei at least once.

770
00:49:00,934 --> 00:49:04,062
Shira... Why did you release
my chakra points?

771
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,318
So you noticed?

772
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,613
I wanted to fight you

773
00:49:09,638 --> 00:49:11,348
when you could give
a hundred percent.

774
00:49:12,306 --> 00:49:14,701
As I expected, you are strong.

775
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,663
It was a great experience.

776
00:49:18,139 --> 00:49:19,391
What are you saying?

777
00:49:19,432 --> 00:49:20,767
You were too reckless!

778
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:28,590
Shira, I want you to have this.

779
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:31,218
Guy-sensei gave it to me.

780
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,387
This is what made me strong.

781
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,389
It is a unique item with
superior breathability

782
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:37,950
and moisture-wicking qualities
that let you move easily!

783
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:40,853
You'll see the difference
when you train!

784
00:49:41,125 --> 00:49:42,627
You'll get attached
to it immediately!

785
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:45,232
Wear this...
and we'll be brothers!

786
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:48,819
Thanks... I accept it.

787
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:53,198
Shira... You said earlier
that this would be your last fight...

788
00:49:54,206 --> 00:49:55,458
In the Land of Wind,

789
00:49:55,483 --> 00:49:58,236
there is a battalion that guards
the northern border.

790
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:01,289
That battalion never leaves
its station.

791
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,077
The environment there
is extremely harsh,

792
00:50:04,102 --> 00:50:06,188
so few candidates
are willing to accept that mission.

793
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:10,716
I plan to volunteer for it
if I pass this exam.

794
00:50:12,056 --> 00:50:13,391
It's near my hometown.

795
00:50:14,521 --> 00:50:16,981
My parents are sick and
I want to be close to them.

796
00:50:18,047 --> 00:50:20,675
So I probably won't see
any of you again.

797
00:50:22,989 --> 00:50:24,157
I see how it is...

798
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:27,107
Shira... I had no idea.

799
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:31,236
I guess that means I won't
be seeing you around either, Yome.

800
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:33,864
You're probably going
to tag along, right?

801
00:50:38,608 --> 00:50:41,152
I have no regrets about my life.

802
00:50:41,981 --> 00:50:44,942
But I'm sure my life would
have been more interesting

803
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,627
if I had had a friend like you.

804
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:51,506
I'm going to remember that as
the greatest compliment from you!

805
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:55,218
And I mean it as such, Lee,
in all sincerity.

806
00:51:06,126 --> 00:51:07,961
Now we have two scrolls!

807
00:51:08,336 --> 00:51:10,670
Then let's head straight
for the goal!

808
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:19,240
<i>So, when should I break
the news to them...?</i>

809
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:29,544
According to reports from
the investigative team,

810
00:51:29,758 --> 00:51:31,927
two members of Team Fuu
from the Hidden Waterfall...

811
00:51:31,952 --> 00:51:34,872
Tocchi and Kun...
are actually not Genin.

812
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:38,887
It is believed they are Jonin
named Kegon and Yoro.

813
00:51:39,097 --> 00:51:40,063
Damn Hidden Waterfall...

814
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,057
What are they scheming?

815
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,141
Wait.

816
00:51:44,317 --> 00:51:46,569
Let me handle this.

817
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:51,191
This information is not
to go out of this room.

818
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:52,234
– But!
– But!

819
00:51:52,417 --> 00:51:55,086
The second test will
continue uninterrupted.

820
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:56,863
Understood?!

821
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:01,493
What is Lord Gaara thinking?!

822
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:24,891
It will be sundown soon.

823
00:52:25,449 --> 00:52:26,226
Yes.

824
00:52:26,522 --> 00:52:29,400
From here, we'll be able to sense
the enemy's presence right away.

825
00:52:29,425 --> 00:52:31,260
It's the perfect spot to make camp.

826
00:52:31,644 --> 00:52:32,645
So where's Fuu?

827
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:35,443
Hey! She was over there
just a second ago...

828
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:40,198
Fuu!

829
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:44,786
That brat! She's so carefree!

830
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:51,084
What the—?!

831
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,087
Poke, poke!

832
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:01,428
Fuu! Don't go off on your own!

833
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:02,721
Damn it!

834
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:05,151
What if someone from
another village attacked you?

835
00:53:05,745 --> 00:53:08,326
You are vital to
the Hidden Waterfall...!

836
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,687
Okay, I get it! I'll be right there!

837
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:16,359
Seriously! If you keep making a scene,
we're going to get spotted!

838
00:53:21,112 --> 00:53:22,113
Fuu...

839
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:24,284
She's a...

840
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:31,124
Judging from their headbands,
they belong to the Hidden Rain...

841
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:34,461
Which scroll do they have?
Heaven or Earth?

842
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,017
All you do is run away!

843
00:53:49,227 --> 00:53:50,854
Just be nice and
hand over your scroll!

844
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:57,275
That's not happening.

845
00:53:58,213 --> 00:53:59,214
Ajisai...

846
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:04,532
<i>Fire Style:</i>

847
00:54:04,796 --> 00:54:07,215
<i>Unsealing Jutsu: Confetti Storm!</i>

848
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:24,636
They ran away?

849
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:27,473
Our strength scared them off!

850
00:54:28,102 --> 00:54:30,396
Just when we almost had their scroll!

851
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:55,292
Lady Angel...

852
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:59,587
Lady Angel,
what is our special mission?

853
00:55:00,966 --> 00:55:04,720
Take advantage of the Chunin Exam
to find a Jinchuriki.

854
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,512
A Jinchuriki?

855
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,515
Suiren, Fuyou...

856
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:13,977
Use your Sensory Perception skills
and look for a shinobi

857
00:55:14,002 --> 00:55:15,962
who harbors
an enormous amount of chakra.

858
00:55:16,382 --> 00:55:18,259
Is that what a Jinchuriki is?

859
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,443
Even if you don't find a Jinchuriki,

860
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:26,323
bring back intel of any extraordinary
shinobi from other villages.

861
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:27,532
– Yes.
– Yes.

862
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:30,118
You will follow these two, Ajisai.

863
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,245
I understand.

864
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:35,832
The Hidden Rain is in
the midst of a reformation.

865
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:38,585
Other villages must not find out.

866
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:42,589
They must continue to believe
that Hanzo of the Salamander

867
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:44,507
rules the Hidden Rain.

868
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:45,967
– Yes!
– Yes!

869
00:55:52,568 --> 00:55:53,879
What is it, Ajisai?

870
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:58,521
You can so see so many stars
in other villages...

871
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:02,150
Stars...!

872
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:04,694
So this is what a starlit sky is like...

873
00:56:07,441 --> 00:56:08,816
Oh... a shooting star!

874
00:56:09,182 --> 00:56:10,558
It's the first time I've seen one...

875
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:14,079
We'll see them too, someday,
in Hidden Rain Village.

876
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:25,715
Now then...

877
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:28,802
There's no other shinobi
in the area.

878
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:31,471
Okay, we can relax
and have a meal.

879
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:35,475
We're having okonomiyaki
pancakes for dinner!

880
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:37,268
Okonomiyaki?

881
00:56:37,347 --> 00:56:39,808
Okonomiyaki in the desert...
Who would have expected that?

882
00:56:42,109 --> 00:56:45,725
We all need to eat well
and maintain our strength.

883
00:56:46,252 --> 00:56:48,129
It's convenient having you around, Tenten.

884
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:49,447
What do you mean
by "convenient"?

885
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,491
It's so great that
you're so convenient!

886
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:53,451
Excuse me?

887
00:56:53,571 --> 00:56:55,281
I may have convenient tools,

888
00:56:55,306 --> 00:56:57,558
but that doesn't make me
a convenient tool, got it?

889
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:00,959
No, no!
You're absolutely convenient!

890
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:02,502
Come on!

891
00:57:05,173 --> 00:57:07,300
I am not convenient!

892
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:09,759
You can prepare your own meal.

893
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:12,637
Hey, Tenten...

894
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:14,347
Don't follow me!

895
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:18,601
I wonder what happened?

896
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:20,103
I don't know either.

897
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:21,563
What do we do?

898
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:23,022
Don't look at me.

899
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:40,915
That was just me venting, wasn't it?

900
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,751
Tenten...

901
00:57:44,857 --> 00:57:46,776
The okonomiyaki pancakes
are done.

902
00:57:47,769 --> 00:57:48,770
Let's eat!

903
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:52,510
How do they taste?

904
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:55,805
I'm not too confident
about them, but...

905
00:58:18,638 --> 00:58:20,890
Looks like it's going to
be another hot day.

906
00:58:20,915 --> 00:58:22,875
It's the complete opposite
of Hidden Rain Village.

907
00:58:25,067 --> 00:58:26,819
A little dampness would be nice.

908
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:33,301
I see a little bit of green over there.

909
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:39,933
<i>Byakugan!</i>

910
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:43,853
What do you see, Neji?

911
00:58:46,692 --> 00:58:48,193
There's no one around here.

912
00:58:50,598 --> 00:58:51,974
Let's keep moving.

913
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:55,823
As we approach the finish line,
others are bound to appear.

914
00:58:56,757 --> 00:58:57,592
You're right.

915
00:58:57,724 --> 00:58:59,435
It's better than lying in wait.

916
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:03,373
If we're going to wait,
I see a good spot.

917
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:04,807
Where?

918
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,085
Want to go and check it out?

919
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,677
This place is eerie.

920
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:18,346
I see caves all around us.

921
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:20,265
It seems to be a ruin.

922
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:21,599
A ruin?

923
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:23,810
Yeah... of the Land of Wind.

924
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:28,940
Just as I expected.

925
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,117
They're Hidden Leaf shinobi.

926
00:59:39,502 --> 00:59:41,295
They look different from
yesterday's bunch.

927
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:44,956
Yesterday's trio was
totally unimpressive.

928
00:59:45,534 --> 00:59:47,661
I wonder what these guys are like?

929
00:59:50,318 --> 00:59:51,903
They're heading right for us.

930
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:55,008
They have
a Sensory Perception type too.

931
00:59:55,488 --> 00:59:56,823
We'll ambush them.

932
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:00,346
They're lying in wait.

933
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:02,599
What about their scroll?

934
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:04,767
We'll fight and snatch it away.

935
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:07,020
Looks like they plan
to do the same thing.

936
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:08,430
They're coming straight for us!

937
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:19,407
Let's not waste time
on senseless fighting.

938
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:21,326
I'll be blunt.

939
01:00:22,293 --> 01:00:24,086
We have the Heaven scroll.

940
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:28,790
If this is what you're after, let's fight.

941
01:00:29,308 --> 01:00:31,310
<i>Unsealing Jutsu: Shuriken!</i>

942
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:33,212
That jutsu...!

943
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:34,797
<i>Rotation!</i>

944
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:44,140
<i>Summoning Jutsu:
Gate of Rainwater!</i>

945
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:01,991
You...!

946
01:01:02,049 --> 01:01:05,553
You're not the only one who
can use Transportation Ninjutsu.

947
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:10,500
Those guys are pretty good.

948
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:12,251
Yeah, however...

949
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:15,463
None of them are overflowing with
large amounts of chakra.

950
01:01:16,261 --> 01:01:17,262
Ajisai...

951
01:01:17,997 --> 01:01:20,249
<i>Unsealing Jutsu: Confetti Storm!</i>

952
01:01:34,982 --> 01:01:36,067
They ran away!

953
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:37,902
<i>Byakugan!</i>

954
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:42,990
Let's go after them!

955
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:52,709
They're coming after us.

956
01:01:52,734 --> 01:01:54,854
They definitely have
a Sensory type with them.

957
01:01:57,933 --> 01:01:58,934
<i>Water Style:</i>

958
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:01,259
<i>Hidden Drizzle Jutsu!</i>

959
01:02:13,385 --> 01:02:14,428
What happened?

960
01:02:15,501 --> 01:02:17,420
There's little moisture around here.

961
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,628
My Water Style doesn't work well.

962
01:02:24,306 --> 01:02:26,600
We know we're at
a territorial disadvantage.

963
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:29,662
It's an impossible battle,
but we have no choice but to fight.

964
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,544
<i>Leaf Hurricane!</i>

965
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:41,758
Above you, Lee!

966
01:02:46,007 --> 01:02:47,509
<i>– Senbon Rainstorm!
– Senbon Rainstorm!</i>

967
01:03:08,393 --> 01:03:09,394
You're pretty good!

968
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:12,705
<i>Gentle Fist!</i>

969
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,878
<i>Leaf Drop!</i>

970
01:03:50,455 --> 01:03:51,456
Tenten!

971
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:53,621
Ajisai!

972
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:01,552
I sense their chakra underground...

973
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:03,589
but it's deep down.

974
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,216
The sand and gravel are in the way.

975
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:07,969
We can't waste time
fighting senselessly.

976
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:12,348
We're going to save our teammate,
so we request that you not interfere.

977
01:04:12,723 --> 01:04:14,100
Same here.

978
01:04:15,075 --> 01:04:17,932
Yes, let's call a truce for now.

979
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:19,897
We're not at war.

980
01:04:20,321 --> 01:04:21,899
This is just the Chunin Exam.

981
01:04:22,561 --> 01:04:25,898
Our teammate's safety is more important
than passing or failing.

982
01:04:26,478 --> 01:04:27,738
We agree to your plan.

983
01:04:28,327 --> 01:04:30,747
But we'll conduct our own search.

984
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:37,415
This looks like a ruin
of the Land of Wind.

985
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:41,294
Ajisai and the other shinobi fell
into an underground corridor.

986
01:04:41,453 --> 01:04:44,998
If it's a corridor,
it has to connect from somewhere.

987
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,498
Should we just use brute strength
and dig from above?

988
01:04:51,835 --> 01:04:53,871
There's a risk of collapse.

989
01:04:54,922 --> 01:04:56,632
We should search for
a passageway into the ruin

990
01:04:56,657 --> 01:04:58,159
and follow them underground.

991
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:20,499
Yikes...

992
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:22,209
What's wrong?

993
01:05:22,625 --> 01:05:24,335
Burn with the passion of youth!

994
01:05:24,607 --> 01:05:26,609
Let your youthful energy seethe!

995
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,925
Fill up with burning chakra!

996
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:30,968
But Guy-sensei...

997
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:33,847
I thought this is
just strength training!

998
01:05:34,433 --> 01:05:35,757
You're too easygoing, Tenten.

999
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:37,600
Somewhere along this cliff,

1000
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:40,102
your physical strength
will reach its limits.

1001
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:42,980
Then you will fall and die.

1002
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:43,778
Die?

1003
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:45,650
To prevent yourself from dying,

1004
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:47,860
you must overcome the limits
of your physical strength.

1005
01:05:47,885 --> 01:05:52,347
Overcoming the limits of
physical strength requires a strong will.

1006
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:54,200
Yes sir!

1007
01:05:54,421 --> 01:05:57,633
Hi there.
Are you guys cliff-climbing too?

1008
01:05:58,436 --> 01:05:59,855
Hang in there.

1009
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:01,141
Kakashi?!

1010
01:06:01,295 --> 01:06:03,464
Why is your arm
behind your back?

1011
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:06,587
It's a little habit of mine.

1012
01:06:06,923 --> 01:06:08,550
Well, see you later!

1013
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:10,675
"See you later"?

1014
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:12,410
Wait up! This is a contest!

1015
01:06:13,585 --> 01:06:15,254
I'm finishing first!

1016
01:06:16,330 --> 01:06:20,084
Don't get so worked up.
This is only training.

1017
01:06:20,206 --> 01:06:22,458
What's wrong with
a little rivalry during training!

1018
01:06:22,895 --> 01:06:25,622
Hey, please wait, Guy-sensei!

1019
01:06:25,647 --> 01:06:27,608
You can take it easy!

1020
01:06:28,089 --> 01:06:29,090
Honestly...

1021
01:06:50,769 --> 01:06:52,437
Damn, damn it...

1022
01:06:52,552 --> 01:06:53,553
Damn it...

1023
01:06:55,939 --> 01:06:58,483
Good job, Tenten. You made it.

1024
01:06:58,605 --> 01:07:00,607
Well? Did you overcome your limits?

1025
01:07:00,854 --> 01:07:02,606
I'm not quite sure...

1026
01:07:02,631 --> 01:07:04,717
But I think I overcame something.

1027
01:07:06,138 --> 01:07:07,139
Water?

1028
01:07:13,257 --> 01:07:14,258
Here you go.

1029
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:16,699
You're convenient, after all.

1030
01:07:17,369 --> 01:07:18,954
Please stop saying that already.

1031
01:07:19,603 --> 01:07:21,730
I mean, your jutsu is convenient.

1032
01:07:25,318 --> 01:07:27,320
Storing items in a scroll,

1033
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:30,588
or using a scroll to pull things
from a distance...

1034
01:07:30,869 --> 01:07:34,331
The Transportation Technique,
which is a type of Summoning Jutsu.

1035
01:07:35,048 --> 01:07:36,841
You either have the skill
for it or you don't.

1036
01:07:37,261 --> 01:07:40,180
You're saying that
I have the skill for it?

1037
01:07:40,631 --> 01:07:41,632
Seems that way.

1038
01:07:41,886 --> 01:07:43,721
Honing that skill is the path

1039
01:07:43,746 --> 01:07:46,791
to gaining the strength
and usefulness you desire.

1040
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:48,644
Hone my skill?

1041
01:07:49,246 --> 01:07:51,650
Isn't that only going to increase
my physical strength?

1042
01:07:51,746 --> 01:07:53,372
Your spiritual strength too.

1043
01:07:53,896 --> 01:07:56,189
You know that chakra
is the combination

1044
01:07:56,265 --> 01:07:59,894
of physical energy and
spiritual energy, right?

1045
01:07:59,919 --> 01:08:00,920
Of course.

1046
01:08:01,419 --> 01:08:06,514
Each individual can increase
chakra simply by training.

1047
01:08:06,878 --> 01:08:09,798
Simply put, if you increase
your physical and spiritual power,

1048
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,671
your chakra will increase too.

1049
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:17,051
Increasing my chakra
is good for me?

1050
01:08:17,757 --> 01:08:19,342
With Summoning Jutsu,

1051
01:08:19,367 --> 01:08:22,620
the caster's chakra
is directly proportionate

1052
01:08:22,646 --> 01:08:24,439
to the quantity and size
of what is summoned.

1053
01:08:24,901 --> 01:08:28,071
This is the amount of water
you just summoned.

1054
01:08:28,261 --> 01:08:29,720
By increasing your chakra,

1055
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:31,607
you can summon enough water
to fill a bathtub,

1056
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:34,652
or a lake, or even an ocean.

1057
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:37,113
An ocean...

1058
01:08:48,595 --> 01:08:52,683
And that is why we will continue
to train to increase our chakra, Tenten.

1059
01:08:52,878 --> 01:08:53,921
Right!

1060
01:08:56,882 --> 01:09:00,014
We just climbed up,
so why are we climbing down?!

1061
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:01,512
This is training too!

1062
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:03,597
Burn with the passion of youth!

1063
01:09:03,889 --> 01:09:06,058
Let your youthful energy seethe!

1064
01:09:06,208 --> 01:09:07,626
Fill up with burning chakra!

1065
01:09:08,622 --> 01:09:09,623
Huh?

1066
01:09:25,454 --> 01:09:26,455
Where am I?

1067
01:09:49,101 --> 01:09:50,102
Hey!

1068
01:09:51,312 --> 01:09:52,438
Hey, come on.

1069
01:10:05,975 --> 01:10:10,313
Look... I don't think this is
the time to be fighting.

1070
01:10:17,129 --> 01:10:17,893
Here.

1071
01:10:18,505 --> 01:10:20,341
Let's call a truce
until we get out of here.

1072
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:21,717
What do you say?

1073
01:10:22,866 --> 01:10:24,117
That's fine...

1074
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:26,347
But I don't need charity
from one of the Great Nation!

1075
01:10:27,179 --> 01:10:28,916
What? "Charity?"

1076
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:30,893
<i>Unsealing Jutsu!</i>

1077
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,940
If you had water,
you could have just said so.

1078
01:10:37,441 --> 01:10:40,290
The Great Nations...
don't understand pain.

1079
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:42,321
Pain? What are you talking about?

1080
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:45,783
Exactly.

1081
01:10:49,411 --> 01:10:54,166
You don't know pain, or the suffering
you inflict upon smaller nations.

1082
01:10:54,475 --> 01:10:57,061
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1083
01:10:57,586 --> 01:11:00,631
But do you understand
that we need to

1084
01:11:01,091 --> 01:11:03,636
help each other
in order to get out of here?

1085
01:11:05,190 --> 01:11:06,059
Help each other?

1086
01:11:06,387 --> 01:11:08,222
I wonder where we are.

1087
01:11:11,061 --> 01:11:13,147
An ancient ruin
of the Land of Wind.

1088
01:11:13,852 --> 01:11:15,604
This is probably
some underground structure.

1089
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:17,273
You think so too?

1090
01:11:17,898 --> 01:11:20,734
It looks difficult to go up that way.

1091
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:22,695
I agree.

1092
01:11:26,218 --> 01:11:27,219
Shall we try?

1093
01:11:27,731 --> 01:11:29,107
We don't have a choice.

1094
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:35,379
How are your teammates?

1095
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:37,626
What about them?

1096
01:11:38,215 --> 01:11:42,219
My teammates aren't suited for
search and rescue...

1097
01:11:42,423 --> 01:11:44,216
So I'm not going to
depend on them to find me...

1098
01:11:45,344 --> 01:11:47,304
I plan to get out of here
on my own as well...

1099
01:11:55,463 --> 01:11:56,129
Oh!

1100
01:11:57,271 --> 01:11:58,397
Did you find anything?

1101
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:01,275
No. I thought this was
the entrance to the ruin,

1102
01:12:01,358 --> 01:12:02,526
but it's just a boulder.

1103
01:12:14,198 --> 01:12:18,379
I heard it rains all year long in
Hidden Rain Village, is that true?

1104
01:12:19,993 --> 01:12:20,994
Yes, it is.

1105
01:12:22,756 --> 01:12:24,717
I can't even imagine it.

1106
01:12:25,991 --> 01:12:26,992
Probably not.

1107
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:32,164
You've had an attitude
all this time.

1108
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:34,683
But you know, you guys
are also to blame

1109
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:37,603
for why we don't know much
about the Hidden Rain.

1110
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,605
We are?

1111
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:41,065
Yes.

1112
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:43,609
I've heard that secrecy is
a doctrine of the Hidden Rain.

1113
01:12:44,068 --> 01:12:47,196
So it's no wonder that we don't
know anything about you guys.

1114
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:51,200
The only time we
come into contact with you guys

1115
01:12:51,241 --> 01:12:53,243
is through something like
the Chunin Exam.

1116
01:12:53,952 --> 01:12:55,245
But because this is a test,

1117
01:12:55,245 --> 01:12:57,331
instead of talking with each other,
we have to fight.

1118
01:12:58,207 --> 01:12:59,208
That's true.

1119
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,543
You guys can come to
Konoha

1120
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:03,337
or Hidden Sand Village...

1121
01:13:03,362 --> 01:13:04,780
but if we were to go to
the Hidden Rain,

1122
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,215
we wouldn't be allowed to enter.

1123
01:13:07,985 --> 01:13:11,113
A small nation like the Hidden Rain
must be extremely careful.

1124
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,180
There are other small nations too...

1125
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:14,932
The Hidden Rain is a special case.

1126
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:20,187
You're right...
The Hidden Rain Village is special.

1127
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:23,357
The Hidden Rain will be reborn.

1128
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:26,385
Does that mean you'll be more open?

1129
01:13:26,785 --> 01:13:27,953
– That's...
– Wait.

1130
01:13:29,863 --> 01:13:31,115
Did you hear something?

1131
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:35,953
Is it your teammates?

1132
01:13:36,203 --> 01:13:37,204
I doubt that...

1133
01:13:37,630 --> 01:13:38,631
I guess not.

1134
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:42,126
What is it?!

1135
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:43,127
It's an ant.

1136
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:44,711
An ant this huge?!

1137
01:13:52,886 --> 01:13:54,346
It's so hard!

1138
01:14:14,741 --> 01:14:16,869
They don't call this place
the Demon Desert for nothing...

1139
01:14:16,894 --> 01:14:19,230
Unreal things live here.

1140
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:20,873
I wonder if there are others?

1141
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:23,267
I hope not...
But these are ants and...

1142
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:24,918
This place is probably
swarming with them.

1143
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:27,546
Let's capture one.

1144
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:28,630
What?

1145
01:14:28,714 --> 01:14:30,757
Capture one for what?

1146
01:14:31,036 --> 01:14:33,122
To tame it and make it into
a Summoning Creature.

1147
01:14:33,791 --> 01:14:34,792
A summoning...

1148
01:14:35,032 --> 01:14:39,202
Besides, their nest could be
connected to other openings.

1149
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:49,401
You know how to Summon right?

1150
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:50,652
Yes.

1151
01:14:50,677 --> 01:14:51,678
Is there a trick to it?

1152
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:53,906
I wouldn't know.

1153
01:14:55,282 --> 01:14:57,159
I guess it's just sheer talent...

1154
01:15:04,041 --> 01:15:05,292
Maybe it's beyond here.

1155
01:15:20,307 --> 01:15:22,267
I sense a little chakra...

1156
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:26,480
It seems like she's moving,
but I can't tell for sure.

1157
01:15:26,984 --> 01:15:28,569
Found you!

1158
01:15:32,906 --> 01:15:34,867
This is the 100th time we've met!

1159
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:38,033
This time, you're going to
hand over your scroll to us!

1160
01:15:41,578 --> 01:15:42,704
One of them is missing.

1161
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:44,414
Are they operating separately?

1162
01:15:44,976 --> 01:15:46,520
Which means it's three against two...

1163
01:15:46,685 --> 01:15:48,061
and we have the advantage.

1164
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:52,548
What's with that beat-up umbrella?

1165
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:55,175
What do you think
you can do with that?

1166
01:16:05,352 --> 01:16:07,020
Planning to run away again?!

1167
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:09,273
You won't get away this time!

1168
01:16:12,192 --> 01:16:13,860
Who are you guys?

1169
01:16:14,194 --> 01:16:15,195
Let's make this clear.

1170
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:17,364
Those guys are our prey.

1171
01:16:17,948 --> 01:16:20,742
You won't be attacking
these two right now.

1172
01:16:21,012 --> 01:16:24,057
We're in the midst of
helping each other.

1173
01:16:25,752 --> 01:16:28,005
Helping? The Hidden Rain?

1174
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:30,877
You mean to tell us that
you're Hidden Leaf like us,

1175
01:16:30,902 --> 01:16:32,612
and you're getting in our way?

1176
01:16:32,963 --> 01:16:34,131
We're all participants in this exam.

1177
01:16:34,965 --> 01:16:38,135
If it comes down to it,
we can come after your scroll too.

1178
01:16:38,218 --> 01:16:39,720
What?!

1179
01:16:39,886 --> 01:16:41,513
You want to fight us?

1180
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:43,078
Don't underestimate us.

1181
01:16:43,103 --> 01:16:44,980
After all,
there's only two of you too.

1182
01:16:45,809 --> 01:16:46,977
What shall we do, Neji?

1183
01:16:47,171 --> 01:16:48,984
I want to avoid fighting
as much as possible,

1184
01:16:49,009 --> 01:16:50,094
but we don't have a choice.

1185
01:16:50,522 --> 01:16:52,608
So you're going to come at us,
three against two?

1186
01:16:53,871 --> 01:16:54,872
No.

1187
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:56,862
You guys!

1188
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:58,071
We'll assist you.

1189
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:01,199
Wh-What's going on with you guys?

1190
01:17:01,224 --> 01:17:03,017
You're kidding, right?

1191
01:17:03,219 --> 01:17:04,595
You're going to team up
with the Hidden Rain

1192
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:05,996
to fight fellow
Hidden Leaf shinobi?

1193
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:08,540
According to the second test's rules,

1194
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:10,709
being from the same village
has no bearing whatsoever.

1195
01:17:11,214 --> 01:17:14,842
If you possess the Earth scroll,
you're fair game.

1196
01:17:15,505 --> 01:17:16,506
Fair game?

1197
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:18,133
Th-That's not fair!

1198
01:17:19,343 --> 01:17:20,677
If that's the case...

1199
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:24,348
Retreat!

1200
01:17:24,373 --> 01:17:26,041
We'll remember this!

1201
01:17:26,183 --> 01:17:28,518
We're going to be Chunin,
no matter what!

1202
01:17:34,156 --> 01:17:35,824
Why did you help us?

1203
01:17:37,248 --> 01:17:40,292
To save our teammates,
we need to cooperate.

1204
01:17:41,438 --> 01:17:43,398
Didn't you come to
the same conclusion?

1205
01:17:44,136 --> 01:17:45,137
Yeah...

1206
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:50,207
Then let's all work together
to save Tenten and your friend.

1207
01:17:56,546 --> 01:17:57,547
It's the nest...

1208
01:17:58,632 --> 01:18:00,801
There's no way we can capture one...

1209
01:18:01,843 --> 01:18:02,844
Look.

1210
01:18:04,721 --> 01:18:07,432
The ant hole
must lead to the outside.

1211
01:18:09,851 --> 01:18:12,187
And... you're suggesting
we go right through this?

1212
01:18:13,373 --> 01:18:14,958
It looks difficult, doesn't it?

1213
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:17,734
We should go back
to the original corridor.

1214
01:18:18,026 --> 01:18:19,027
You're right.

1215
01:18:22,572 --> 01:18:23,573
Not good!

1216
01:18:30,997 --> 01:18:31,998
Hurry!

1217
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:38,046
Is that an entrance?

1218
01:18:38,355 --> 01:18:39,648
You're probably right.

1219
01:18:39,733 --> 01:18:42,027
Okay! Hang in there, Tenten!

1220
01:18:42,279 --> 01:18:43,280
Hey, Lee!

1221
01:18:43,443 --> 01:18:44,861
I'm coming!

1222
01:18:46,346 --> 01:18:47,848
There are ridiculously huge ants!

1223
01:18:49,015 --> 01:18:50,016
Lee!

1224
01:18:51,601 --> 01:18:53,812
We're prey to them.

1225
01:18:55,021 --> 01:18:56,148
I'll distract them.

1226
01:18:56,670 --> 01:18:59,006
Neji, you guys go in
and find the two.

1227
01:19:00,067 --> 01:19:01,068
Got it!

1228
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:14,624
<i>8 Trigrams: Air Palm!</i>

1229
01:19:17,794 --> 01:19:18,795
Hurry!

1230
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:19,880
– Right!
– Right!

1231
01:19:22,924 --> 01:19:24,968
<i>Leaf Hurricane!</i>

1232
01:19:28,972 --> 01:19:30,932
You're not getting past me!

1233
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:35,020
I guess...

1234
01:19:35,979 --> 01:19:37,898
They wouldn't understand
what I'm saying...

1235
01:19:49,326 --> 01:19:50,327
They're chasing us.

1236
01:20:17,854 --> 01:20:19,064
No way...

1237
01:20:21,858 --> 01:20:23,068
It's caved in...

1238
01:20:23,109 --> 01:20:24,110
So we can't pass?

1239
01:20:24,903 --> 01:20:25,904
<i>Byakugan!</i>

1240
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:31,326
They're in there.

1241
01:20:31,785 --> 01:20:33,954
Yeah, that's Ajisai's chakra.

1242
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:35,288
Everyone step aside.

1243
01:20:35,872 --> 01:20:38,708
Stop! An explosion
might trigger a cave in.

1244
01:20:43,463 --> 01:20:44,631
<i>8 Trigrams: Open Palm!</i>

1245
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:52,597
I suppressed its power
to try to contain it,

1246
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:53,932
but I guess it wasn't effective.

1247
01:20:55,122 --> 01:20:56,832
Not much different
than a paper bomb.

1248
01:20:57,352 --> 01:20:58,353
What'll we do?

1249
01:20:58,728 --> 01:20:59,729
Hey!

1250
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:07,988
What was... that tremor just now?

1251
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:10,866
It's from the outside.

1252
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:13,451
Someone is trying to
clear this rubble.

1253
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:14,911
Your friends?

1254
01:21:15,203 --> 01:21:16,413
Or yours.

1255
01:21:16,788 --> 01:21:18,540
I wonder if they can do it.

1256
01:21:19,374 --> 01:21:20,458
Seems it will be difficult.

1257
01:21:23,044 --> 01:21:24,045
They're coming!

1258
01:21:25,088 --> 01:21:26,089
Wait.

1259
01:21:27,966 --> 01:21:29,092
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

1260
01:21:34,055 --> 01:21:35,473
Ward them off.

1261
01:21:47,777 --> 01:21:48,778
What are you going to do?

1262
01:21:49,029 --> 01:21:51,281
I'm going to transport the debris
to another dimension

1263
01:21:51,306 --> 01:21:52,558
with my Transportation Jutsu.

1264
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:54,951
But you don't even know
how much sand and gravel there is!

1265
01:21:54,951 --> 01:21:56,411
This is the only thing left to try.

1266
01:22:08,089 --> 01:22:11,301
I'll either remove the rubble,
or I'll run out of chakra.

1267
01:22:11,718 --> 01:22:12,844
<i>Enclosing Jutsu!</i>

1268
01:22:28,985 --> 01:22:30,111
Please, do it too.

1269
01:22:30,236 --> 01:22:32,906
Huh?! But I've never
done anything like this...

1270
01:22:33,156 --> 01:22:35,742
It's similar to stowing away
weapons and tools.

1271
01:22:35,867 --> 01:22:37,535
You say it's similar but...

1272
01:22:55,053 --> 01:22:56,054
Come here!

1273
01:22:58,848 --> 01:23:00,517
This is impossible!

1274
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:10,485
Do you remember the last Chunin Exam?

1275
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:11,987
– Yeah.
– Yes.

1276
01:23:12,737 --> 01:23:13,738
Uh-huh.

1277
01:23:13,905 --> 01:23:14,906
The last time,

1278
01:23:14,930 --> 01:23:18,975
the Chunin Exam was cancelled
due to unforeseen circumstances.

1279
01:23:19,534 --> 01:23:21,286
On top of not being promoted to Chunin,

1280
01:23:21,496 --> 01:23:22,497
I was useless during

1281
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:24,499
the Hidden Leaf's most critical moment.

1282
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:26,626
It couldn't be helped.

1283
01:23:27,036 --> 01:23:31,166
You were seriously wounded
and unable to take action.

1284
01:23:31,609 --> 01:23:34,445
I'm ashamed that I was
perfectly healthy, but helpless.

1285
01:23:35,051 --> 01:23:36,928
Well, that shouldn't
bother you now.

1286
01:23:37,425 --> 01:23:40,845
After two years, the Chunin Exam
is being held again.

1287
01:23:41,177 --> 01:23:42,303
Is that true?

1288
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:46,604
And so, I must at least ask you...

1289
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:49,983
Will the three of you take
this Chunin Exam as a team?

1290
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:51,441
That goes without saying.

1291
01:23:51,933 --> 01:23:52,975
Of course, we will!

1292
01:23:54,008 --> 01:23:54,863
Uh-huh.

1293
01:23:55,238 --> 01:23:57,161
That's the power of youth!

1294
01:23:57,198 --> 01:23:59,367
We've grown much stronger
since then!

1295
01:24:00,573 --> 01:24:02,617
What's the matter, Tenten?
Are you unsure?

1296
01:24:03,541 --> 01:24:07,061
Sensei, have I gotten
stronger since then?

1297
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:10,253
You... should have.

1298
01:24:11,563 --> 01:24:14,024
But I have nothing to show for it.

1299
01:24:17,802 --> 01:24:19,112
Without a doubt,

1300
01:24:19,137 --> 01:24:21,097
you have persevered
and trained since that time.

1301
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:23,600
Admittedly, we can't see it

1302
01:24:23,683 --> 01:24:25,602
as we can Neji's jutsu
or Lee's technique.

1303
01:24:26,227 --> 01:24:29,022
But do not forget, Tenten.

1304
01:24:31,357 --> 01:24:34,402
Hard work and dedication
will never betray you.

1305
01:24:54,839 --> 01:24:56,049
<i>Unsealing Jutsu!</i>

1306
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:14,692
Hey! Are you all right?!

1307
01:25:16,903 --> 01:25:18,655
– The rubble...
– But...

1308
01:25:19,244 --> 01:25:22,717
it's impossible for me to
remove the rubble like you do.

1309
01:25:22,742 --> 01:25:23,743
Hurry!

1310
01:25:23,827 --> 01:25:25,411
The ants will dig right through it.

1311
01:25:33,353 --> 01:25:35,647
I just have to suck it up
and do it!

1312
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:39,300
If hard work and dedication
never betray you...

1313
01:25:40,009 --> 01:25:41,803
Then my chakra has increased!

1314
01:26:17,755 --> 01:26:19,966
I almost drowned in the desert.

1315
01:26:29,475 --> 01:26:30,476
You did it.

1316
01:26:31,394 --> 01:26:32,395
Yeah.

1317
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:35,565
Seawater in the desert!

1318
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:37,901
Tenten, you demonstrated
the fruits of your labor.

1319
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:40,570
I sure did, didn't I?!

1320
01:26:40,653 --> 01:26:41,654
As expected!

1321
01:26:42,906 --> 01:26:43,907
Now then...

1322
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:47,285
We had a truce. So what now?

1323
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:51,164
If you agree,
can we continue this truce?

1324
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:53,041
It's fine with us.

1325
01:26:53,541 --> 01:26:56,336
After what we went through,
I don't feel like fighting.

1326
01:26:57,346 --> 01:26:59,598
We're going to head straight
for the finish line.

1327
01:27:00,514 --> 01:27:01,515
As for us...

1328
01:27:02,728 --> 01:27:03,771
Yes...

1329
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:06,804
We'll detour right
and search for a scroll.

1330
01:27:07,474 --> 01:27:08,475
Thank you.

1331
01:27:08,973 --> 01:27:09,974
Huh?

1332
01:27:09,974 --> 01:27:13,102
I think I've got the hang of it,
thanks to you.

1333
01:27:14,008 --> 01:27:16,135
Yeah? I'm glad.

1334
01:27:16,814 --> 01:27:18,858
Let's both do our best...

1335
01:27:19,317 --> 01:27:21,152
... and meet up in the third test.

1336
01:27:21,861 --> 01:27:22,862
Yes.

1337
01:27:26,350 --> 01:27:28,436
See you again!

1338
01:27:32,914 --> 01:27:34,999
The other villages
are very curious.

1339
01:27:35,359 --> 01:27:37,861
Yes... There are so many
different kinds of shinobi.

1340
01:27:38,628 --> 01:27:41,756
I wonder if Hidden Rain Village
will go through many changes?

1341
01:27:42,173 --> 01:27:43,466
We will change it...

1342
01:27:43,591 --> 01:27:45,927
By having faith in Lord Pain
and Lady Angel.

1343
01:27:46,177 --> 01:27:47,220
– Yeah.
– Yes.

1344
01:27:47,845 --> 01:27:48,846
Let's go.

1345
01:27:48,846 --> 01:27:50,556
We must continue our search
for a Jinchuriki.
