1
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,333
There are two bells...

2
00:01:33,806 --> 00:01:35,975
The fact that there are
only two bells means...

3
00:01:36,568 --> 00:01:37,861
One person will lose...

4
00:01:38,373 --> 00:01:40,125
You're very sharp, Orochimaru.

5
00:01:41,091 --> 00:01:43,885
Say! If I get a bell,
you'll go out with me.

6
00:01:44,324 --> 00:01:47,160
If you lose,
don't bother me anymore.

7
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,818
All right! I'll do it!

8
00:01:55,234 --> 00:01:56,652
So many openings...

9
00:01:57,068 --> 00:01:58,069
Now!

10
00:02:06,452 --> 00:02:11,206
I won the bet, Jiraiya!
You get to go to the log.

11
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:14,693
Shut up, flat-as-a-board Tsunade!

12
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:17,689
What'd you say?!
You egg-headed perv!!

13
00:02:17,824 --> 00:02:19,743
Now, now. That's enough...

14
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,200
Tsunade and Orochimaru may go.

15
00:02:23,918 --> 00:02:24,849
Okay!

16
00:02:28,468 --> 00:02:30,303
You are hopeless...

17
00:02:30,682 --> 00:02:34,686
How can a ninja keep falling
into such obvious traps?!

18
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:35,712
Can't help it...

19
00:02:36,437 --> 00:02:39,691
Perhaps what you lack
is a purpose...

20
00:02:40,233 --> 00:02:40,966
Huh?!

21
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:42,879
Let's see now...

22
00:02:44,195 --> 00:02:46,406
Yes! We'll try this!

23
00:02:46,431 --> 00:02:47,724
Wh-What?!

24
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:51,128
Don't get so excited. Just watch.

25
00:02:59,778 --> 00:03:01,696
<i>Ninja Art: Summoning Jutsu!</i>

26
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:05,881
Awesome!

27
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:09,523
You make a blood contract
with an animal,

28
00:03:09,548 --> 00:03:13,886
and summon them at any time
using the Space-Time Ninjutsu.

29
00:03:14,249 --> 00:03:16,960
I want to make a contract
with that one too!

30
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,653
That, you can't do.

31
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,753
Huh?

32
00:03:20,481 --> 00:03:22,955
In the same way that every man
is destined to a different fate,

33
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,818
so too is the animal to whom
he is linked.

34
00:03:27,505 --> 00:03:29,590
Then which is my animal?

35
00:03:30,036 --> 00:03:31,537
Before you can make a contract,

36
00:03:31,562 --> 00:03:35,316
you need to be more adept
at molding chakra and sealing.

37
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:38,318
What? Not more training!

38
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,669
You will always find the answer
in your training!

39
00:03:44,738 --> 00:03:47,116
<i>Jiraiya had found a purpose
and from that day on,</i>

40
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:50,853
<i>he began taking
his training seriously. However...</i>

41
00:03:51,677 --> 00:03:53,221
<i>Mold more chakra...</i>

42
00:03:53,912 --> 00:03:55,956
<i>Study up on sealing...</i>

43
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:04,318
I must master the Summoning Jutsu...

44
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,760
Damn it!

45
00:04:07,173 --> 00:04:09,300
When will I be able to
make a contract?

46
00:04:10,746 --> 00:04:13,999
<i>Why do I put up with
this rough training?</i>

47
00:04:14,994 --> 00:04:16,430
<i>If I were to have a boyfriend,</i>

48
00:04:16,455 --> 00:04:19,282
<i>I'd choose Orochimaru over
an egghead perv like you.</i>

49
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,958
The answer is simple!

50
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,908
I just have to become the ultimate
ninja and sweep Tsunade off her feet!

51
00:04:28,641 --> 00:04:32,144
Now that that's settled,
there's no time to waste!

52
00:04:35,816 --> 00:04:36,692
Ah...

53
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:40,096
So he's discovered his purpose
for becoming a ninja.

54
00:04:41,826 --> 00:04:43,285
<i>And not just Tsunade,</i>

55
00:04:43,523 --> 00:04:45,483
<i>I'm going to get all the pretty girls
to myself.</i>

56
00:04:46,484 --> 00:04:48,695
<i>Let's see...
Concentrate my chakra and...</i>

57
00:04:48,736 --> 00:04:51,416
<i>the seal is boar, dog,
bird, monkey, ram...</i>

58
00:04:51,441 --> 00:04:53,493
Wait! There's no telling
what will happen

59
00:04:53,518 --> 00:04:56,605
if you use the Summoning Jutsu
without making a contract first!

60
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,389
Go!

61
00:05:23,721 --> 00:05:24,722
Where am I...?

62
00:05:34,641 --> 00:05:35,934
Hold it right there!

63
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,951
I, the great Master Jiraiya,
shall take over this fight!

64
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,793
Heh! I guess that'll do!

65
00:05:53,446 --> 00:05:54,288
Hmmm...

66
00:05:55,127 --> 00:05:56,587
A human child.

67
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:59,117
Huh?! A-A talking toad!

68
00:05:59,412 --> 00:06:01,280
And what about you?

69
00:06:01,305 --> 00:06:04,124
To think, a human would really
come to Mount Myoboku...

70
00:06:04,645 --> 00:06:05,897
What do you mean?!

71
00:06:11,507 --> 00:06:12,884
Lord Fukasaku!

72
00:06:13,601 --> 00:06:15,603
It's a human child.

73
00:06:16,726 --> 00:06:19,103
Oh... so you've arrived.

74
00:06:19,568 --> 00:06:22,738
You talk as though
you've been expecting me.

75
00:06:23,422 --> 00:06:28,886
Yes, I knew you were coming.
The Great Lord Elder predicted it.

76
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:34,337
<i>A human child will stumble
into Mount Myoboku,</i>

77
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:38,539
<i>and I will give that child the power
of the toad and a prophecy.</i>

78
00:06:40,741 --> 00:06:44,912
<i>That is the dream which
I dreamt of myself...</i>

79
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,198
<i>My very own prophecy.</i>

80
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,698
If that human is me...
then what is my prophecy?!

81
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:58,275
Well... I don't know.

82
00:06:58,868 --> 00:06:59,994
Don't know?

83
00:07:00,651 --> 00:07:02,987
You must stay here and train,

84
00:07:03,108 --> 00:07:05,743
and wait for
the Great Lord Elder's prophecy.

85
00:07:05,768 --> 00:07:07,562
H-Hold it!

86
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:11,050
I made up my mind to become strong
so that I'll be popular with women...

87
00:07:11,366 --> 00:07:13,201
There's no point in getting popular
with frogs!

88
00:07:13,437 --> 00:07:17,983
Quit complaining!
This is your destiny.

89
00:07:19,488 --> 00:07:20,740
My destiny?!

90
00:07:21,463 --> 00:07:25,592
Yes. You managed to come
to Mount Myoboku.

91
00:07:25,617 --> 00:07:30,205
This is proof that you were indeed
the chosen one.

92
00:07:31,334 --> 00:07:33,210
<i>The chosen one, eh?</i>

93
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:38,417
<i>Training here and becoming strong...
That's pretty tempting too.</i>

94
00:07:41,412 --> 00:07:44,457
<i>From this day forward,
Jiraiya divided his time between</i>

95
00:07:44,482 --> 00:07:48,694
<i>Mount Myoboku, the land of toads,
and the Hidden Leaf Village...</i>

96
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,846
<i>He spent the days of his youth
in both Sage and ninjutsu training.</i>

97
00:08:11,215 --> 00:08:12,550
<i>However...</i>

98
00:08:12,732 --> 00:08:17,195
<i>It was not to be as simple as
Jiraiya had thought.</i>

99
00:09:00,238 --> 00:09:03,241
<i>I've definitely gotten stronger
since coming here.</i>

100
00:09:03,783 --> 00:09:04,526
<i>But...</i>

101
00:09:05,743 --> 00:09:07,787
<i>Tsunade is as cold as ever.</i>

102
00:09:08,287 --> 00:09:09,404
<i>Not just that...</i>

103
00:09:09,429 --> 00:09:12,324
<i>If I was destined to be
the chosen one,</i>

104
00:09:12,736 --> 00:09:15,197
<i>should my purpose simply
be to impress a girl?</i>

105
00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:18,577
<i>Is that the only reason why
I'm trying to become strong?</i>

106
00:09:19,048 --> 00:09:20,800
Jiraiya! Jiraiya!

107
00:09:21,342 --> 00:09:22,343
Yeah?

108
00:09:23,553 --> 00:09:26,055
Jiraiya, the Great Lord Elder
has summoned you.

109
00:09:26,681 --> 00:09:28,182
The Great Lord Elder...?

110
00:09:28,558 --> 00:09:32,144
Hurry up.
He has seen your prophecy!

111
00:09:32,478 --> 00:09:34,272
For real, Bunta?!

112
00:09:37,608 --> 00:09:38,401
As summoned.

113
00:09:38,442 --> 00:09:41,404
Ah, good. I'm glad you've come!

114
00:09:41,904 --> 00:09:42,905
Huh?

115
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:47,089
Who are you again?

116
00:09:47,746 --> 00:09:51,416
Great Lord Elder, it's Jiraiya!
This is Jiraiya!

117
00:09:51,818 --> 00:09:57,583
Oh, that's right! Right!
My, how you've grown...

118
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:01,716
Gah, you're the one who summoned him,
ya great senile old geezer!

119
00:10:01,841 --> 00:10:02,967
Senile old geezer?!

120
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:08,067
How dare ya call
the Great Lord Elder a senile old geezer!

121
00:10:08,905 --> 00:10:13,576
Now now, let's not fight.
Spouses oughta get along...

122
00:10:16,257 --> 00:10:17,926
By the way...

123
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,829
Who are you, again?

124
00:10:24,439 --> 00:10:26,191
Jiraiya-boy.

125
00:10:26,381 --> 00:10:29,884
The Great Lord Elder had
a dream about you.

126
00:10:30,328 --> 00:10:33,540
As you are aware,
it is a prophecy.

127
00:10:33,878 --> 00:10:35,254
So listen carefully.

128
00:10:35,888 --> 00:10:36,722
Yes, sir!

129
00:10:37,452 --> 00:10:41,331
I shall now tell you.
In my dream...

130
00:10:41,442 --> 00:10:45,404
you, who are nothing but a pervert,
will still manage to become a splendid ninja.

131
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:49,933
And in time, you will have
your own disciple...

132
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:51,860
<i>Solely pervy...?</i>

133
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:55,212
<i>Can't believe he remembers
that particular detail...</i>

134
00:10:56,621 --> 00:11:00,333
That disciple will become a ninja
who will bring about a great change

135
00:11:00,358 --> 00:11:02,610
to the ninja world.

136
00:11:02,785 --> 00:11:05,037
That is what I saw in my dream.

137
00:11:05,396 --> 00:11:06,480
A great change?

138
00:11:06,672 --> 00:11:10,092
Either great stability
or great destruction.

139
00:11:10,117 --> 00:11:12,578
The likes of which this world
has never seen before.

140
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,872
One of those two.

141
00:11:15,537 --> 00:11:18,081
One of those two?
What does that mean?

142
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,765
You will guide that revolutionary.

143
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:27,253
The day will come when you will
be forced to make a critical selection.

144
00:11:28,177 --> 00:11:29,220
Selection?

145
00:11:29,995 --> 00:11:36,001
Your choice shall decide
which way the change goes.

146
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:43,069
What must I do...?
In order to make the right choice?

147
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:48,041
In my dream, you traveled the world,
writing books.

148
00:11:48,904 --> 00:11:50,781
Books? Whatever for?

149
00:11:51,117 --> 00:11:54,078
I do not know either.

150
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,931
Perhaps it will be a journey
around the world

151
00:11:56,956 --> 00:11:59,333
to see all things in nature.

152
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:03,425
Great Lord Elder, have your prophecies
ever not come to pass?

153
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,173
No, never.

154
00:12:10,511 --> 00:12:13,431
Jiraiya, you are leaving?

155
00:12:13,681 --> 00:12:14,640
Yup!

156
00:12:15,057 --> 00:12:16,186
At this point in my life,

157
00:12:16,211 --> 00:12:18,630
there's no way I can guide someone
who will be a revolutionary...

158
00:12:18,686 --> 00:12:21,939
Let alone make the right choice.

159
00:12:22,231 --> 00:12:23,065
Hmm...

160
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:26,277
I guess I need more time
to see many more things,

161
00:12:26,277 --> 00:12:27,737
and meet different people.

162
00:12:28,094 --> 00:12:29,095
I see...

163
00:12:29,864 --> 00:12:32,241
Just like in
the Great Lord Elder's dream,

164
00:12:32,241 --> 00:12:35,077
I shall journey throughout the world
and perhaps, write a book.

165
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,112
It seems that is my destiny.

166
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,462
<i>While Jiraiya journeyed and
searched for the meaning</i>

167
00:12:44,503 --> 00:12:47,465
<i>behind the Great Lord Elder's dream,</i>

168
00:12:47,673 --> 00:12:51,552
<i>the state of the world grew
steadily more chaotic.</i>

169
00:12:52,091 --> 00:12:56,428
<i>The peace that had prevailed among
the Five Great Nations became fragile.</i>

170
00:12:56,651 --> 00:13:01,364
<i>Aggression between lands
increased as did internal strife,</i>

171
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:05,274
<i>and the people began to suffer.</i>

172
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:15,388
Young man...
Why are you traveling?

173
00:13:15,951 --> 00:13:18,204
I'm searching for my destiny.

174
00:13:18,628 --> 00:13:19,523
Oh...?

175
00:13:19,778 --> 00:13:21,196
Someone saw me in a dream.

176
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:23,473
And just like in that dream,
I journey from land to land.

177
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,381
Oh my, what's the matter...?

178
00:13:30,834 --> 00:13:32,794
Here, have one. It's milk candy.

179
00:13:40,017 --> 00:13:41,018
A puppet?

180
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:45,981
Oh, this child tells me...
Destiny is not something you search for!

181
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,318
Destiny is something you latch onto
when it presents itself.

182
00:13:49,949 --> 00:13:52,243
The age of war is coming.

183
00:13:52,613 --> 00:13:55,991
Mechanical skills are useless
in times of peace,

184
00:13:56,033 --> 00:13:59,245
but some feudal lord may pay
a high price for my services.

185
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,307
<i>So he is a ninja too...</i>

186
00:14:03,707 --> 00:14:07,753
<i>He has chosen to ride the wave
to the age of destruction.</i>

187
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,501
<i>But that will only...</i>

188
00:14:11,674 --> 00:14:13,676
Let's have more fun.

189
00:14:14,051 --> 00:14:14,969
Come on.

190
00:14:14,994 --> 00:14:15,995
Mmmm...

191
00:14:16,303 --> 00:14:17,471
What are you writing?

192
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,147
Just scribbling...
that riding on the wave of the times

193
00:14:20,408 --> 00:14:27,040
will not result in the revolutionary
change needed for peace.

194
00:14:27,398 --> 00:14:30,526
Say, say! If you're going to
change something, change me!

195
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,958
I suppose you're right.
That does sound more fun.

196
00:14:35,188 --> 00:14:36,460
This is fraud!

197
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:39,669
As if I'll pay for something like this!

198
00:14:41,026 --> 00:14:42,778
Hold it right there!

199
00:14:44,498 --> 00:14:47,543
I shall take over this fight!

200
00:14:51,128 --> 00:14:51,920
Damn it!

201
00:14:52,172 --> 00:14:53,841
How can fate be so cruel?!

202
00:14:54,091 --> 00:14:57,261
I worked hard on cultivating the land
with what little knowledge I had.

203
00:14:57,286 --> 00:14:59,121
All for the sake of my clan, and yet...

204
00:14:59,513 --> 00:15:03,475
<i>So this fellow is dissatisfied with
the way the world is going...</i>

205
00:15:04,268 --> 00:15:05,644
Have a drink...

206
00:15:06,186 --> 00:15:10,274
I've been searching for
my destiny too, but it's very elusive.

207
00:15:10,524 --> 00:15:13,318
Humph... It's useless to search
for something like that.

208
00:15:14,111 --> 00:15:15,654
My people have no chance

209
00:15:15,696 --> 00:15:18,240
against the ninja villages
of the Great Nations...

210
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:22,162
<i>This guy...
Is that all he can do... complain?</i>

211
00:15:22,578 --> 00:15:24,038
You are wrong...

212
00:15:24,204 --> 00:15:24,895
Huh?

213
00:15:25,536 --> 00:15:28,373
I teach children in a village...

214
00:15:28,606 --> 00:15:33,653
about how to fight back
against a harsh fate.

215
00:15:34,006 --> 00:15:36,759
So education could end a war?

216
00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:40,421
Cut the pretty talk!

217
00:15:42,003 --> 00:15:43,004
What?!

218
00:15:43,648 --> 00:15:45,108
<i>Is he a ninja too?</i>

219
00:15:45,768 --> 00:15:47,269
No, that it cannot...

220
00:15:47,478 --> 00:15:49,979
However, perhaps I can
teach them skills

221
00:15:50,004 --> 00:15:52,517
that enable them
to make better choices.

222
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,611
Let me ask you...
What are those choices?

223
00:15:57,043 --> 00:15:59,587
Life or death...
Those are the choices.

224
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:04,351
The only thing I can teach them
is how to survive.

225
00:16:07,377 --> 00:16:09,254
<i>That's not good enough.</i>

226
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:14,797
<i>I must choose the revolutionary
who will bring peace to the world.</i>

227
00:16:27,518 --> 00:16:29,728
To bring destruction upon this world.

228
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:32,773
Or to bring about a peace which
we have never known before...

229
00:16:33,016 --> 00:16:35,561
That depends on the commitment
of each and every person!

230
00:16:37,145 --> 00:16:39,564
<i>Hmm... Could this person be...?</i>

231
00:16:40,008 --> 00:16:41,009
Say, you!

232
00:16:41,388 --> 00:16:44,224
You just might be the person
I've been looking for!

233
00:16:44,572 --> 00:16:45,269
Oh...?

234
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,638
What would you do in order
to bring peace to this world?

235
00:16:48,918 --> 00:16:51,962
The world is heading towards
an age of war and strife...

236
00:16:52,483 --> 00:16:53,817
There's no stopping it.

237
00:16:54,267 --> 00:16:56,853
Didn't you just say it depends on
each person's commitment?

238
00:16:56,968 --> 00:16:59,763
How do we change
these people's destinies?

239
00:17:04,072 --> 00:17:08,618
Just pray hard.
That is all men can do.

240
00:17:10,827 --> 00:17:13,246
<i>This man is not the one... either.</i>

241
00:17:22,604 --> 00:17:23,605
What was that?!

242
00:17:29,197 --> 00:17:32,742
This is just an ordinary village!
Why would a ninja...?!

243
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:55,918
This shuriken jutsu...

244
00:17:56,054 --> 00:17:57,639
You are from the Fuma, aren't you?!

245
00:17:57,664 --> 00:18:00,501
Why attack people who
are living in peace?!

246
00:18:00,654 --> 00:18:02,197
You are also a ninja.

247
00:18:02,669 --> 00:18:05,922
I am journeying in search of the one
who will become my disciple.

248
00:18:06,407 --> 00:18:08,784
Humph! Why waste time
on such a tedious thing?!

249
00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:11,311
The balance of power between
lands has become shaky

250
00:18:11,336 --> 00:18:14,757
and we are on the verge of
a great war...

251
00:18:15,315 --> 00:18:19,861
That village was also destroyed due
to a tip that ninja had infiltrated it.

252
00:18:20,278 --> 00:18:22,155
Just because of a tip?!

253
00:18:22,695 --> 00:18:24,530
It's destroy, or be destroyed.

254
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,752
We live in a world where
you'll die if you hesitate!

255
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,043
<i>A smoke bomb!</i>

256
00:18:42,008 --> 00:18:43,927
You're pretty good.

257
00:18:44,552 --> 00:18:47,555
If you are a ninja too,
I cannot let you live.

258
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:52,100
Just give up...
This is our fate as ninja.

259
00:18:52,456 --> 00:18:54,374
Can I say something?

260
00:18:55,085 --> 00:18:56,419
I don't feel like listening...

261
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,858
Just... die!!

262
00:18:59,818 --> 00:19:01,778
Give up...

263
00:19:04,219 --> 00:19:05,512
... on me giving up!

264
00:19:14,624 --> 00:19:16,084
Even if you bring me down,

265
00:19:16,109 --> 00:19:18,236
another assassin will attack
the village...

266
00:19:18,461 --> 00:19:21,422
As long as we are cursed to live
in this ninja world,

267
00:19:21,447 --> 00:19:23,295
there will be no peace.

268
00:19:26,112 --> 00:19:28,865
<i>The Great Toad Sage's
prophecy said that I am destined</i>

269
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:33,518
<i>to train the revolutionary
who will bring peace to this world.</i>

270
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:38,439
<i>However, I haven't even encountered
this disciple.</i>

271
00:19:41,408 --> 00:19:46,038
<i>Already at this time,
battles were inevitably being fought.</i>

272
00:19:46,322 --> 00:19:50,660
<i>Jiraiya was also forced to take
a short break from his journey</i>

273
00:19:50,702 --> 00:19:54,247
<i>and returned to the Hidden Leaf Village.</i>

274
00:20:08,453 --> 00:20:11,122
We're at war... after all.

275
00:20:12,849 --> 00:20:13,892
Orochimaru...

276
00:20:17,573 --> 00:20:20,910
<i>In order to erase this sadness
from the ninja world...</i>

277
00:20:21,274 --> 00:20:23,651
<i>I must find the revolutionary...</i>

278
00:20:24,235 --> 00:20:27,572
<i>I must choose the one
who will bring peace.</i>

279
00:20:29,991 --> 00:20:37,207
<i>The flames of war finally drew
in Jiraiya and his comrades.</i>

280
00:20:37,332 --> 00:20:42,921
<i>This would come to be known
as the Third Great Ninja War.</i>

281
00:20:43,588 --> 00:20:47,550
<i>Shortly afterwards, the three
would come to be known</i>

282
00:20:47,592 --> 00:20:51,012
<i>as the "Legendary Sannin."</i>

283
00:20:58,728 --> 00:21:02,941
I predict the Hidden Leaf shall
emerge victorious from this battle.

284
00:21:03,257 --> 00:21:05,801
Therefore, I shall let you three live.

285
00:21:05,877 --> 00:21:08,838
We don't want your sympathy!
We can still fight!

286
00:21:08,863 --> 00:21:10,073
Jiraiya, stop!

287
00:21:10,616 --> 00:21:12,785
You three are strong...

288
00:21:12,825 --> 00:21:15,453
You survived even this battleground.

289
00:21:15,761 --> 00:21:21,392
I, Hanzo, hereby name you
the "Hidden Leaf's Sannin."

290
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,463
In exchange for your lives,
tell me your names.

291
00:21:29,092 --> 00:21:33,554
Will it really end with
the Hidden Leaf's victory like he said?

292
00:21:34,448 --> 00:21:37,702
And if it does, then what?
Will you set out on another journey?

293
00:21:38,726 --> 00:21:39,977
Maybe...

294
00:21:41,062 --> 00:21:44,691
Set out on my travels and
write another book...

295
00:21:47,402 --> 00:21:50,280
Why won't you settle down
in the village?

296
00:21:52,991 --> 00:21:56,035
I feel as though
I haven't encountered it yet.

297
00:21:57,078 --> 00:21:58,913
You mean, your destiny?

298
00:21:59,163 --> 00:22:00,164
Quiet!

299
00:22:05,169 --> 00:22:06,754
They're just kids.

300
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,298
Don't let your guard down.

301
00:22:08,756 --> 00:22:11,592
Even little mice can be from
the Hidden Rain Village.

302
00:22:12,135 --> 00:22:14,262
Don't hide. Show yourself!

303
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,525
What do you want?

304
00:22:28,109 --> 00:22:29,652
Give me some food!

305
00:22:30,403 --> 00:22:31,446
What about your parents?

306
00:22:32,058 --> 00:22:34,355
They were killed by ninja
because of this war.

307
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:39,330
Here... have some bread.

308
00:22:41,304 --> 00:22:45,850
Nagato, Konan, come on out!
They don't seem like bad guys.

309
00:22:58,467 --> 00:22:59,112
Hey!

310
00:23:12,011 --> 00:23:15,473
We already gave you food!
Why are you following us?!

311
00:23:32,965 --> 00:23:35,968
Thank you. This is for you...

312
00:23:36,302 --> 00:23:39,263
It's origami...
folded from the bread wrapper.

313
00:23:40,014 --> 00:23:41,432
This is for us?

314
00:23:43,351 --> 00:23:45,561
Teach us ninjutsu...

315
00:23:45,978 --> 00:23:47,897
You're all ninja from
the Hidden Leaf, right?

316
00:23:49,107 --> 00:23:51,651
Shall I kill these children?

317
00:23:51,984 --> 00:23:52,985
Wha--?!

318
00:23:53,403 --> 00:23:56,989
I've seen many war orphans.
It's pitiful.

319
00:23:57,365 --> 00:24:01,494
They would be better off if we just
put them out of their misery right now...

320
00:24:01,494 --> 00:24:05,498
Orochimaru, enough!
You go on ahead with Tsunade.

321
00:24:05,915 --> 00:24:08,501
I'll stay here and look after them
for a while.

322
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,961
Huh?!

323
00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:13,732
Just until they can take better
care of themselves...

324
00:24:14,132 --> 00:24:16,300
It is the least I can do.

325
00:24:16,467 --> 00:24:17,510
But...

326
00:24:23,766 --> 00:24:25,768
<i>This is also part of destiny...</i>

327
00:24:29,355 --> 00:24:31,274
Thank you for the food!

328
00:24:31,486 --> 00:24:34,489
Grilled fish in an instant with
my Fire Style Jutsu.

329
00:24:35,884 --> 00:24:37,249
Mm... Delicious!

330
00:24:37,283 --> 00:24:40,328
Sensei! I've gotten the hang of fishing!

331
00:24:43,788 --> 00:24:44,509
Hmm?

332
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:50,334
What's the matter, Nagato?

333
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:54,005
I just remembered my family...

334
00:24:54,503 --> 00:24:55,231
And...

335
00:24:56,299 --> 00:24:57,967
Stop crying! You're a man!

336
00:24:58,449 --> 00:25:01,644
It's because of guys like you that
the Hidden Rain are considered cowards!

337
00:25:03,281 --> 00:25:05,992
Things are unstable among
three of the Great Nations

338
00:25:06,017 --> 00:25:08,144
that surround the Hidden Rain Village.

339
00:25:08,769 --> 00:25:11,189
But this war won't drag out much longer.

340
00:25:11,939 --> 00:25:14,066
By the time you are grown,

341
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:16,959
there will be mutual understanding
and peace will-

342
00:25:16,984 --> 00:25:18,318
That's not fair!

343
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,777
We all lost our families!

344
00:25:22,366 --> 00:25:25,453
If there is a mutual understanding, it's
only after they go through what we did!

345
00:25:25,868 --> 00:25:27,912
That's what it means to get even, right?!

346
00:25:30,566 --> 00:25:34,487
But... I know that's impossible.

347
00:25:35,371 --> 00:25:37,164
That's why wars will never end!

348
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:43,101
I hate rain.

349
00:25:44,096 --> 00:25:46,307
This land is always crying.

350
00:25:46,958 --> 00:25:47,959
It's a coward!

351
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,806
I'm going to change this land.

352
00:25:52,522 --> 00:25:53,898
I'll protect everyone!

353
00:25:54,524 --> 00:25:58,653
That's why Jiraiya-sensei...!
Please teach us ninjutsu!

354
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:16,212
<i>I don't have any ideas for my novel...</i>

355
00:26:19,871 --> 00:26:23,316
<i>If there is a mutual understanding, it's
only after they go through what we did!</i>

356
00:26:24,138 --> 00:26:26,182
<i>That's why wars will never end!</i>

357
00:26:27,014 --> 00:26:28,432
<i>I'll protect everyone!!</i>

358
00:26:40,204 --> 00:26:46,084
<i>I want the hero to wipe away
the hatred and bring about peace...</i>

359
00:26:47,307 --> 00:26:49,184
<i>Now then... how can I...?</i>

360
00:26:50,413 --> 00:26:53,666
Jiraiya-sensei, help!
Yahiko and Nagato are in trouble...!

361
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:54,959
Lead the way, Konan!!

362
00:27:00,256 --> 00:27:01,799
I brought Sensei!

363
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:04,760
What happened?

364
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,345
This...

365
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:11,048
This leftover ninja told us to hand
over our food... and valuables.

366
00:27:11,743 --> 00:27:13,884
Then Nagato...

367
00:27:15,663 --> 00:27:18,290
<i>He's a Chunin from the Hidden Stone...</i>

368
00:27:18,649 --> 00:27:19,859
<i>How did Nagato...?</i>

369
00:27:25,489 --> 00:27:27,283
<i>Th-Those eyes...!!</i>

370
00:27:28,326 --> 00:27:30,953
<i>He couldn't... possibly be...!</i>

371
00:27:33,664 --> 00:27:37,960
<i>That shape... That ripple pattern...
I can't believe it!</i>

372
00:27:38,544 --> 00:27:39,629
<i>That eye...</i>

373
00:27:39,862 --> 00:27:43,366
<i>Said to hold the most noble of
the Three Great Dojutsu...</i>

374
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:44,863
<i>The Rinnegan!</i>

375
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,069
<i>The Sage of the Six Paths,
said to be the father of all ninja...</i>

376
00:27:49,094 --> 00:27:52,264
<i>It is said that the Sage possessing
the Rinnegan eye</i>

377
00:27:52,289 --> 00:27:54,416
<i>developed all the jutsu known to us today.</i>

378
00:27:55,099 --> 00:27:57,977
<i>Rumored to always appear
when the world becomes corrupt,</i>

379
00:27:58,002 --> 00:28:00,296
<i>capable of being both
a godlike force of creation</i>

380
00:28:00,356 --> 00:28:03,317
<i>and an all-obliterating instrument
of destruction.</i>

381
00:28:03,986 --> 00:28:06,656
<i>I always believed it as a mere legend.</i>

382
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:10,863
<i>But here is someone who actually
possesses the Rinnegan!</i>

383
00:28:11,704 --> 00:28:14,832
<i>Could Nagato be this revolutionary?</i>

384
00:28:18,751 --> 00:28:20,836
<i>Perhaps I have found my destiny.</i>

385
00:28:24,256 --> 00:28:27,343
I've decided to teach you ninjutsu.

386
00:28:27,635 --> 00:28:29,011
R-Really?!

387
00:28:29,345 --> 00:28:33,224
You may encounter another life-threatening
situation like that last time.

388
00:28:33,891 --> 00:28:36,102
It is ninjutsu for self-defense.

389
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:38,104
Yes!

390
00:28:42,358 --> 00:28:47,196
Thanks for saving us last time, Nagato!
Sorry I called you a coward!

391
00:28:47,613 --> 00:28:50,991
Next time anything happens,
I'll protect you!

392
00:28:51,992 --> 00:28:54,537
Th-Thanks, Yahiko.

393
00:28:54,829 --> 00:28:58,958
Huh...? But Nagato is stronger
than you, Yahiko!

394
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:02,128
I'm going to train starting now
and I'll become stronger!

395
00:29:02,378 --> 00:29:04,088
You always exaggerate, Konan!

396
00:29:04,296 --> 00:29:06,590
All right, let's start!

397
00:29:07,466 --> 00:29:09,343
The first lesson is on molding chakra.

398
00:29:09,635 --> 00:29:11,137
- Yes, Sensei!
- Yes, Sensei!

399
00:29:32,283 --> 00:29:34,160
Something's bothering you, eh?

400
00:29:34,785 --> 00:29:35,786
Talk to me.

401
00:29:36,325 --> 00:29:37,326
Sensei...

402
00:29:38,748 --> 00:29:40,040
Is it about that incident?

403
00:29:41,751 --> 00:29:42,752
That day...

404
00:29:43,377 --> 00:29:47,757
When that man hurt Yahiko,
I was so mad at him.

405
00:29:49,008 --> 00:29:52,219
Everything went blank in my head...
I didn't know what I was doing.

406
00:29:53,195 --> 00:29:56,323
Before I realized it, the man was dead...

407
00:29:57,876 --> 00:30:00,545
After that, I got so scared.

408
00:30:01,228 --> 00:30:04,523
This hatred made me lose myself...
and I killed someone.

409
00:30:04,857 --> 00:30:09,195
What I did was wrong!
There must have been a better way--!

410
00:30:09,487 --> 00:30:10,488
Nagato...

411
00:30:12,156 --> 00:30:16,410
I really don't know
if it was right or wrong.

412
00:30:16,869 --> 00:30:20,206
But thanks to you, Yahiko didn't die.

413
00:30:20,873 --> 00:30:22,082
You protected your friend.

414
00:30:22,708 --> 00:30:25,002
That had to be the right thing to do.

415
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,172
No one can blame you for that.

416
00:30:29,507 --> 00:30:31,842
When you are hurt, you learn to hate.

417
00:30:32,151 --> 00:30:34,654
On the other hand, when
you hurt someone, you are resented.

418
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,555
But you start to feel guilty as well.

419
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:43,042
Understanding such pain enables
you to be kind to others...

420
00:30:43,687 --> 00:30:45,105
That's what makes us human.

421
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:48,664
What do you mean by that...?

422
00:30:50,129 --> 00:30:52,256
It's called growing up.

423
00:30:53,629 --> 00:30:56,590
Growing up? What do you mean?

424
00:30:57,535 --> 00:31:00,996
That, you need to figure out yourself.

425
00:31:05,042 --> 00:31:09,922
Konan and I were crying because we
were so hungry and Yahiko saved us.

426
00:31:12,132 --> 00:31:14,134
He stole food from others to feed us.

427
00:31:17,096 --> 00:31:19,098
I just want to protect those two.

428
00:31:20,474 --> 00:31:23,185
No matter what kind of pain
I have to endure.

429
00:31:26,272 --> 00:31:27,273
I see.

430
00:31:31,068 --> 00:31:32,570
Wait, Yahiko!

431
00:31:32,737 --> 00:31:33,904
Wait!

432
00:31:34,486 --> 00:31:35,696
I'm first!

433
00:32:01,557 --> 00:32:04,018
It's a toad, a toad!
A giant toad!

434
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:08,178
How'd it get inside our hideout?

435
00:32:09,062 --> 00:32:10,105
What'll we do?

436
00:32:10,847 --> 00:32:14,893
You're so noisy!
What's all this ruckus about?

437
00:32:15,905 --> 00:32:17,239
Jiraiya-sensei?

438
00:32:17,481 --> 00:32:20,066
Well? Does it look good on me?

439
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,872
Now that you mention it,
I guess so...

440
00:32:30,007 --> 00:32:31,509
The one on the right is Konan's.

441
00:32:31,695 --> 00:32:35,193
The one in the center is Yahiko's.
Nagato's is on the left.

442
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:36,891
What are they?

443
00:32:37,301 --> 00:32:39,261
These are flip tiles.

444
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:41,086
Flip tiles?

445
00:32:41,317 --> 00:32:42,097
Yes.

446
00:32:42,339 --> 00:32:45,800
The top is red and
the bottom is white.

447
00:32:46,312 --> 00:32:48,815
And you flip the tiles
over like this!

448
00:33:00,616 --> 00:33:04,203
Anyway, when we're at the hideout,

449
00:33:04,324 --> 00:33:06,076
the tile will show red.

450
00:33:06,372 --> 00:33:09,506
When we're going out,
flip it to the white side...

451
00:33:09,531 --> 00:33:11,616
then set out.

452
00:33:11,711 --> 00:33:15,757
Furthermore, this picture is a signal
that you'll be returning shortly.

453
00:33:18,926 --> 00:33:21,303
Man, what's with all this anyway?

454
00:33:22,262 --> 00:33:26,433
We're only listening to this flip stuff
because you're the Toad Sage.

455
00:33:30,831 --> 00:33:34,877
But why is it necessary
to do all this?

456
00:33:35,652 --> 00:33:38,036
This area is still politically unstable.

457
00:33:38,061 --> 00:33:40,489
There's no telling when
it will be targeted.

458
00:33:41,281 --> 00:33:45,035
Actually, being at the hideout
makes us easy marks.

459
00:33:45,233 --> 00:33:48,904
If we're all scattered, we can counter,
with a surprise attack, for example.

460
00:33:49,289 --> 00:33:53,418
So if the tile is red,
but someone's not at the hideout,

461
00:33:53,443 --> 00:33:55,445
it could mean the enemy
has kidnapped them.

462
00:33:55,572 --> 00:33:58,032
But if they're here and it's white,

463
00:33:58,101 --> 00:34:00,687
could mean it's a transformed enemy.

464
00:34:01,891 --> 00:34:04,727
It's so we'll be able to recognize
things like that right away, correct?

465
00:34:04,888 --> 00:34:06,557
Something like that.

466
00:34:06,637 --> 00:34:10,725
You're very sharp, Konan.
Unlike Yahiko.

467
00:34:11,441 --> 00:34:13,151
I figured it out too!

468
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:18,444
More or less...

469
00:34:21,697 --> 00:34:24,450
Anyway, this will be a secret code
between the four of us

470
00:34:24,491 --> 00:34:27,536
to make sure we're aware
of each other at all times.

471
00:34:27,895 --> 00:34:32,232
Even if we're at the hideout,
we must be vigilant!

472
00:34:32,458 --> 00:34:33,542
Furthermore...

473
00:34:38,255 --> 00:34:43,243
I constructed a hidden underground
room that has an escape route outside.

474
00:34:43,802 --> 00:34:46,138
Wow, just like a real shinobi!

475
00:34:49,641 --> 00:34:52,227
If anything happens,
use it to get away.

476
00:34:54,104 --> 00:34:55,314
Oh, and by the way...

477
00:34:55,713 --> 00:34:59,216
The tile behind you is... is my tile.

478
00:35:00,447 --> 00:35:05,268
Now then... Shall we begin our
"Water in a Frog's Face" training?

479
00:35:06,116 --> 00:35:08,702
This will hone your ability to
completely become a frog

480
00:35:08,727 --> 00:35:10,854
and stay absolutely still,
no matter what happens.

481
00:35:10,954 --> 00:35:12,539
All right!

482
00:35:16,357 --> 00:35:18,401
Let's get going, everyone!

483
00:35:18,879 --> 00:35:21,381
I wonder if Yahiko is getting all this?

484
00:35:21,962 --> 00:35:24,798
Sensei just showed us what to do.

485
00:35:25,636 --> 00:35:28,347
I want to become stronger!

486
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:30,048
And then...

487
00:35:31,094 --> 00:35:33,096
And then,
I'm going to change the world!

488
00:35:52,579 --> 00:35:54,289
Before you change the world,

489
00:35:54,331 --> 00:35:56,917
you must change
the side on the flip tile!

490
00:35:58,255 --> 00:36:01,467
<i>Did I look like that earlier too?</i>

491
00:36:01,713 --> 00:36:03,507
<i>That's embarrassing.</i>

492
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:22,138
<i>Oh? She used the Wind Style to
speed up her paper shuriken.</i>

493
00:36:33,643 --> 00:36:35,186
Not good enough.

494
00:36:35,706 --> 00:36:38,083
You have get quicker with
timing your coordination!

495
00:36:39,335 --> 00:36:41,420
Let's eat!

496
00:36:41,691 --> 00:36:43,306
– Let's eat!
– Let's eat!

497
00:36:56,237 --> 00:36:58,281
<i>Water Style: Raging Waves!</i>

498
00:37:00,464 --> 00:37:01,674
<i>Paper shuriken!</i>

499
00:37:02,049 --> 00:37:03,509
<i>Wind Style: Gale Palm!</i>

500
00:37:06,026 --> 00:37:07,027
<i>We did it!</i>

501
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,391
How's that, Sensei?!

502
00:37:11,017 --> 00:37:14,103
You're even able to take down
my Shadow Clone now, eh?

503
00:37:19,066 --> 00:37:21,861
Now I can return to my village
without any worries.

504
00:37:21,944 --> 00:37:22,899
- Huh?
- Huh?

505
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:30,286
You are on your own from now on.

506
00:37:30,745 --> 00:37:33,205
You've done well these past three years!

507
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:39,381
Don't cry, Yahiko.
Or people will call you a coward.

508
00:37:40,241 --> 00:37:42,953
Konan... You're going to grow up
to be a beauty.

509
00:37:43,731 --> 00:37:45,608
I'm looking forward to seeing you again.

510
00:37:47,678 --> 00:37:49,472
This is a poor land.

511
00:37:49,896 --> 00:37:52,232
And there's more sadness
and tough times up ahead.

512
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:57,605
But now, you have the strength
to change this land.

513
00:38:02,359 --> 00:38:04,904
Nagato... You three have grown up.

514
00:38:06,197 --> 00:38:07,281
Don't you agree?

515
00:38:13,568 --> 00:38:15,320
Thank you, Sensei.

516
00:38:24,715 --> 00:38:30,471
<i>Even after Jiraiya returned to the village,
the Third Great Ninja War raged on.</i>

517
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:33,474
Tsunade! Orochimaru! Ready?!

518
00:38:33,641 --> 00:38:34,642
Yeah!

519
00:38:36,102 --> 00:38:37,770
<i>- Summoning Jutsu!
- Summoning Jutsu!</i>

520
00:38:44,473 --> 00:38:48,643
<i>The Hidden Leaf's Sannin distinguished
themselves in many battles...</i>

521
00:38:48,739 --> 00:38:52,034
<i>leaving legends in their wake.</i>

522
00:38:54,328 --> 00:38:57,414
All this fighting...
How long must it continue?

523
00:38:58,207 --> 00:39:00,417
What must be done to stop the war?

524
00:39:01,293 --> 00:39:05,548
Humph... As if there's a way to stop it.

525
00:39:06,382 --> 00:39:09,552
Hate only gives birth
to even more hate.

526
00:39:09,802 --> 00:39:10,803
But...!

527
00:39:12,805 --> 00:39:17,226
I don't know how to stop it.
But peace will certainly come.

528
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:21,517
As long as there are those who
believe that, there is hope.

529
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,406
Oh, what's the matter?

530
00:39:47,089 --> 00:39:48,090
What's wrong?

531
00:39:50,038 --> 00:39:51,998
Those three are dead.

532
00:39:53,971 --> 00:39:58,225
I've tried my best to make
the right choices.

533
00:39:58,653 --> 00:40:02,323
I believed that was what destiny
had in store for me.

534
00:40:03,012 --> 00:40:04,097
Jiraiya...

535
00:40:04,564 --> 00:40:09,235
And finally...
I thought I did what was right.

536
00:40:10,763 --> 00:40:13,766
But perhaps,
I was wrong yet again.

537
00:40:17,786 --> 00:40:21,123
You'll find it
as long as you keep believing.

538
00:40:21,874 --> 00:40:26,921
Yes... I guess I'm still in
the middle of my journey.

539
00:40:30,466 --> 00:40:34,094
<i>The Third Great Ninja War dragged on</i>

540
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:37,058
<i>and the one who guided
Hidden Leaf Village to victory</i>

541
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:42,421
<i>was another one of Jiraiya's disciples...
Minato Namikaze.</i>

542
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:51,099
That was long. Too long...

543
00:40:53,111 --> 00:40:54,612
What will you do from now on?

544
00:40:54,802 --> 00:40:58,722
Let's see...
Maybe set out on another journey.

545
00:40:59,703 --> 00:41:03,749
Maybe I'll find a disciple who
can change the world.

546
00:41:04,498 --> 00:41:07,960
Is that your destiny?
The destiny of Jiraiya?

547
00:41:08,587 --> 00:41:10,965
Well, I guess you could say that...

548
00:41:11,215 --> 00:41:13,384
Humph... What a strange man you are.

549
00:41:13,467 --> 00:41:16,095
Hmm? You walk the path of the ninja.

550
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,806
Don't you want someone
to take over after you?

551
00:41:20,975 --> 00:41:24,895
To gather all the jutsu in this world
and master them...

552
00:41:25,896 --> 00:41:28,107
That is my only goal.

553
00:41:28,957 --> 00:41:33,337
Even if you master them all,
humans are not immortal.

554
00:41:33,821 --> 00:41:34,822
She's right.

555
00:41:36,245 --> 00:41:37,955
I wonder about that...

556
00:42:07,146 --> 00:42:08,230
Give it up.

557
00:42:08,689 --> 00:42:10,065
Can I say one thing?

558
00:42:10,316 --> 00:42:11,400
I don't care to listen!!

559
00:42:12,693 --> 00:42:13,902
Die already!

560
00:42:14,794 --> 00:42:16,712
Give up...

561
00:42:18,907 --> 00:42:19,950
... on me giving up!

562
00:42:24,872 --> 00:42:26,498
Even if you bring me down,

563
00:42:26,498 --> 00:42:29,376
another assassin
will attack the village...

564
00:42:32,671 --> 00:42:37,384
As long as we are cursed to live
in this ninja world,

565
00:42:37,426 --> 00:42:39,553
there will be no peace.

566
00:42:40,846 --> 00:42:44,266
Then... I'll break that curse!

567
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:48,775
If there is such a thing as peace,
I'll seize it!

568
00:42:49,396 --> 00:42:51,190
I'll never give up!

569
00:42:53,148 --> 00:42:55,776
Wh-Who are you...?

570
00:42:57,404 --> 00:42:58,697
My name is...

571
00:42:59,281 --> 00:43:03,202
Oh... you were reading my
"Tales of a Gutsy Ninja"?

572
00:43:03,482 --> 00:43:05,679
But it's my first published work.

573
00:43:05,704 --> 00:43:09,291
The writing is childish
and I didn't do a good job.

574
00:43:09,316 --> 00:43:13,361
No, I don't think so.
This tale is wonderful!

575
00:43:13,864 --> 00:43:14,538
Oh...?

576
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,225
Each chapter reads like one
of your numerous legendary exploits.

577
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,304
It's almost like an autobiography.

578
00:43:22,467 --> 00:43:25,304
But... it didn't sell at all.

579
00:43:25,682 --> 00:43:29,269
For my next one, I think I'll add some
sexy elements to spice it up a bit.

580
00:43:29,737 --> 00:43:31,572
The main character of this book...

581
00:43:31,979 --> 00:43:34,815
I thought his determination to
never give up was really cool.

582
00:43:35,413 --> 00:43:37,749
He's a lot like you, Sensei.

583
00:43:38,273 --> 00:43:40,067
Y-You think so...?

584
00:43:40,739 --> 00:43:42,449
So I was thinking.

585
00:43:42,699 --> 00:43:43,367
Huh?

586
00:43:43,575 --> 00:43:46,745
I really hope my child
grows up to be a ninja

587
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:48,772
just like this main character!

588
00:43:49,665 --> 00:43:54,002
Which is why I'd like your permission
to name my son after him.

589
00:43:54,672 --> 00:43:57,425
H-Hey! Are you sure?

590
00:43:57,548 --> 00:44:00,467
It's just a random name that I thought up
while eating ramen.

591
00:44:00,801 --> 00:44:01,802
Naruto...

592
00:44:04,654 --> 00:44:05,906
It's a wonderful name.

593
00:44:09,901 --> 00:44:10,897
Kushina...

594
00:44:14,398 --> 00:44:17,443
Man... So that makes me
his godfather?

595
00:44:17,876 --> 00:44:19,962
Are you really sure about this?

596
00:44:21,905 --> 00:44:23,699
You are my sensei!

597
00:44:24,258 --> 00:44:27,094
And you are a great ninja who possesses
the true talent of a ninja!

598
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,204
There's no other like you.

599
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:34,168
<i>Even after this...</i>

600
00:44:34,168 --> 00:44:37,629
<i>Jiraiya continued his journey
in search of his destiny.</i>

601
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:42,818
<i>It would be a little later before
Jiraiya would meet Naruto</i>

602
00:44:42,843 --> 00:44:45,846
<i>in the Hidden Leaf Village.</i>
