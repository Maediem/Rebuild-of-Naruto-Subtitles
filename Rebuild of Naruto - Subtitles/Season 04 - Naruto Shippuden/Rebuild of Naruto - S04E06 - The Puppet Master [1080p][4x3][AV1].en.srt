1
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,175
What took you so long?

2
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,800
I flew back as quickly
as I could.

3
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:10,385
More to the point,

4
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:13,138
you took too long to send over
a substitute border guard.

5
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:15,932
Your planning was bad.

6
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,727
That's no way to show
your appreciation.

7
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:23,632
I carried out your selfish request
while still recovering from an illness.

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,773
Well... Shall we get going?

9
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:28,695
Yeah.

10
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,196
Right!

11
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:50,718
Neji...

12
00:00:51,095 --> 00:00:52,888
Can you see what's happening
to me here?

13
00:00:57,547 --> 00:00:58,548
Yeah...

14
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,981
The same thing is happening here.

15
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:08,292
<i>Tenten, what about you?</i>

16
00:01:10,582 --> 00:01:12,668
It's probably...
the same here, too.

17
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,200
<i>Lee!</i>

18
00:01:16,806 --> 00:01:21,019
A strange shadow appeared in the forest
as soon as I removed the tag.

19
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:24,085
I thought so...

20
00:01:38,506 --> 00:01:41,300
Team Kakashi has infiltrated
just as planned.

21
00:01:47,987 --> 00:01:50,406
What is... this...?

22
00:02:02,173 --> 00:02:04,258
It's probably an enemy trap.

23
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:07,976
I see...

24
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:29,713
So that's what this is about.

25
00:02:37,983 --> 00:02:41,278
I find you a worthy opponent.

26
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,135
Gaara!

27
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,293
What are you doing lazing around
in a place like this?!

28
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,020
Stand up!

29
00:04:33,592 --> 00:04:34,565
Gaara!

30
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,902
Hey! Gaara! Are you listening?!

31
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,645
Knock it off!

32
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,671
That's enough, Naruto!

33
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,534
You should know...

34
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,064
That's right. You know, don't you?

35
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:52,992
That he's already dead.

36
00:05:01,014 --> 00:05:02,140
Oh...

37
00:05:02,794 --> 00:05:05,255
He's definitely... the Jinchuriki.

38
00:05:06,107 --> 00:05:07,901
Give Gaara back!

39
00:05:08,261 --> 00:05:09,971
You bastards!

40
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,188
Calm down...

41
00:05:14,645 --> 00:05:17,398
If you charge ahead without thinking,
we'll be annihilated.

42
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:24,699
What's up, Master Sasori?

43
00:05:25,278 --> 00:05:27,488
I'll take him.

44
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:34,678
It seems that Jinchuriki wants
to take him back, so...

45
00:05:39,523 --> 00:05:43,319
You'll probably get mad if I say this...

46
00:05:43,832 --> 00:05:46,210
But I'll take care
of that Jinchuriki.

47
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:51,197
Our mission is one Jinchuriki each.

48
00:05:51,566 --> 00:05:53,735
Don't get ahead of yourself, Deidara...

49
00:05:54,445 --> 00:05:58,699
An artist's passion starts to dull

50
00:05:59,538 --> 00:06:02,953
unless they seek
greater stimulation, Master...

51
00:06:04,562 --> 00:06:08,453
The rumor is the Nine-Tailed Jinchuriki
is quite powerful.

52
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:14,767
He's an opponent suitable for my art.

53
00:06:16,201 --> 00:06:20,538
What? You really call those explosions
of yours "art"?

54
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,509
True art is something that
endures beautifully...

55
00:06:24,836 --> 00:06:27,881
far into the future.

56
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:31,400
Eternal beauty is art!

57
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,858
Eternal beauty... is art?

58
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,198
I do respect you as
a fellow artist, Master...

59
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:53,413
But art is fleeting! A moment of beauty
that fades instantly.

60
00:06:54,914 --> 00:07:01,087
Deidara, you clearly don't
understand what true art is.

61
00:07:01,299 --> 00:07:03,092
You're the one
who doesn't understand.

62
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:07,677
No! Eternal beauty is true art.

63
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:11,305
Don't be a fool.
Art is the beauty of a fleeting moment.

64
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,307
Knock it off!

65
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,402
Do you want to make me angry?

66
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,736
I just told you...

67
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:30,074
It would probably make
you angry, didn't I...?

68
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:35,705
You know what happens
when I get angry, don't you?

69
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,709
<i>He blocked the shuriken
without looking at all...</i>

70
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:43,838
<i>He's just as good with the Puppet
Master technique as he always was.</i>

71
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,049
How about it, Deidara?

72
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,058
Art to me is...

73
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,739
an explosion!

74
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:20,917
It's a far cry from
your pathetic puppet show!

75
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:29,842
See you around, Master!

76
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,073
Hey, wait!

77
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,116
<i>All right.</i>

78
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,328
Naruto!

79
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,916
<i>I guess Naruto won't stop, will he?</i>

80
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,380
Naruto and I will take care
of the guy outside.

81
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:10,841
Sakura and Granny Chiyo...
you two take the one inside.

82
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,385
However...

83
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:16,180
make sure you don't do
anything rash until Team Guy gets back.

84
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,640
Got it.

85
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,406
He came too, huh...?

86
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,034
Guy, can you hear me?

87
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,621
The enemy has split up.
We need backup.

88
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:42,707
Return immediately.

89
00:09:44,074 --> 00:09:45,701
<i>I don't think we can.</i>

90
00:09:56,964 --> 00:10:00,843
Sorry Kakashi, it looks like things
will still take a while over here.

91
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,030
<i>Rotation.</i>

92
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:21,954
If detaining someone is your objective,
there's no better way than this.

93
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,596
If your opponent has exactly
the same abilities as you do...

94
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,311
It probably won't be that easy
to bring matters to a close.

95
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:54,403
Splendid move, Imposter.

96
00:10:54,837 --> 00:10:55,838
<i>Signing off!</i>

97
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,200
<i>Looks like...</i>

98
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,455
<i>I can't be wasting my time...</i>

99
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:14,173
I'd heard that you'd retired long ago.

100
00:11:14,824 --> 00:11:18,035
I just wanted to see
my grandson's face again.

101
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,073
<i>I can tell just by facing him.</i>

102
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,737
<i>The incredible difference
in actual battle experience...</i>

103
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:39,712
<i>and the number of people he's killed.</i>

104
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:44,079
Sakura, do not fear...

105
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:52,169
I'm with you. Stay back.

106
00:12:08,265 --> 00:12:11,602
If you're going to defy me,
then I guess I have no choice.

107
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:14,984
Wh-What's that...?

108
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,826
That's not Sasori's real body...

109
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:27,663
I can tell that's not his real body.

110
00:12:28,737 --> 00:12:33,033
Yes...
That's... a puppet.

111
00:12:34,302 --> 00:12:37,514
Puppet Masters are supposed to be
pulling the strings from behind, right?

112
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,135
His real body's inside that.

113
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,388
Inside?

114
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,768
Puppet Masters have trouble
with close-range combat.

115
00:12:49,805 --> 00:12:54,601
After all, when controlling a puppet,
they leave themselves open...

116
00:12:56,197 --> 00:13:00,326
That puppet there has basically
surmounted that problem.

117
00:13:02,729 --> 00:13:08,151
The puppet acts as a shield
as well as a weapon.

118
00:13:09,241 --> 00:13:11,867
It's Sasori's specialty, Hiruko.

119
00:13:12,313 --> 00:13:14,940
Lady Chiyo... About that puppet...

120
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,757
I know a lot about it.

121
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:26,388
Do you know how I make
my collection?

122
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:30,434
First. I pull out the organs...

123
00:13:31,327 --> 00:13:33,982
Then after I've washed
the body nice and clean...

124
00:13:34,007 --> 00:13:35,967
I extract the blood.

125
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:41,057
Once I've prepared the body
so it won't decay,

126
00:13:41,082 --> 00:13:43,084
I fill it with hidden weapons
and then...

127
00:13:43,109 --> 00:13:46,446
it becomes a complete addition
to my puppet collection.

128
00:13:48,824 --> 00:13:52,369
Just as the old woman said,
this form you see...

129
00:13:52,754 --> 00:13:55,873
Hiruko, is a part of my collection.

130
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:59,972
And once I add this girl
and the old hag...

131
00:14:00,978 --> 00:14:04,802
I'll have exactly three hundred
in my collection.

132
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,889
It's my art!

133
00:14:12,693 --> 00:14:15,780
Hiruko is a puppet with
a great attack and defense.

134
00:14:16,294 --> 00:14:21,633
Be that as it may, first we need
to drag Sasori out of Hiruko.

135
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,529
What do we do?

136
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,998
In order to defeat Sasori,

137
00:14:26,507 --> 00:14:29,510
first we must destroy that Hiruko.

138
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:34,373
However, I don't have that kind
of destructive power.

139
00:14:34,606 --> 00:14:37,066
But Sakura...

140
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:39,795
You do.

141
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,131
First, get close to him...

142
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:46,635
and smash the puppet with
your incredible strength.

143
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:55,395
However, you must dodge all
of his hidden weapon attacks.

144
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,363
Poison, right...?

145
00:14:58,175 --> 00:15:02,263
That's right... Even a scratch
can turn into a fatal wound.

146
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:08,754
In order to dodge his attacks,
you must figure out the tricks

147
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:12,453
to the hidden weapons of
the master craftsman's puppet.

148
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:17,458
And you must also be able to immediately
assess how to dodge his attacks.

149
00:15:19,988 --> 00:15:23,283
I don't think I can do either...

150
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,877
Indeed...

151
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:28,879
In order to do that,

152
00:15:28,904 --> 00:15:32,324
a lot of actual battle experience
is required.

153
00:15:32,961 --> 00:15:35,171
Then... how can I...?

154
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,396
What do I look like to you?

155
00:15:40,156 --> 00:15:42,826
Do I just look like
some unreliable old hag...?

156
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,139
Or...

157
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,327
Leave it to me...

158
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,748
That's why I'm here!

159
00:15:59,621 --> 00:16:02,875
I have much more actual
battle experience than he does.

160
00:16:03,437 --> 00:16:05,362
And he knows that.

161
00:16:05,387 --> 00:16:08,933
That's why he doesn't attempt
to attack carelessly.

162
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:12,471
This man who so hates
waiting for people,

163
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,890
and being kept waiting by them...

164
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,642
And besides...

165
00:16:18,453 --> 00:16:20,080
I made the first move.

166
00:16:23,408 --> 00:16:25,452
Sakura. Lend me your ears.

167
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,697
You and I...

168
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,620
will defeat him!

169
00:16:45,932 --> 00:16:48,976
Is it okay for you to be taking me on?

170
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:54,032
Sharingan Kakashi.

171
00:16:57,195 --> 00:16:59,030
I hate to say this, but...

172
00:16:59,368 --> 00:17:02,371
Master Sasori is stronger than me...

173
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,314
Probably...

174
00:17:06,176 --> 00:17:09,930
Our ideas of art are
quite different, though.

175
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:22,708
<i>From here, I can't make out
what they're saying...</i>

176
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,088
Understood.

177
00:17:30,641 --> 00:17:31,684
I'll give it a try.

178
00:17:32,223 --> 00:17:33,975
Are you about ready?

179
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:39,949
You know I hate to
be kept waiting, don't you?

180
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,480
Rest easy. We'll...

181
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:49,695
... put an end to this soon.

182
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:05,026
Die!

183
00:18:14,987 --> 00:18:18,782
<i>They completely dodged
my attack just now?</i>

184
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:30,109
<i>I'd expect it from the old hag.</i>

185
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,819
<i>But that little girl...</i>

186
00:18:33,801 --> 00:18:36,012
<i>I'm being mocked...</i>

187
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:40,661
<i>I can't believe she's charging at me
head on without any backup...</i>

188
00:18:50,434 --> 00:18:51,936
<i>It won't move!</i>

189
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:54,968
<i>I get it! Grandma...!</i>

190
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,219
Now, Sakura!

191
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,389
Smash him!

192
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,431
Right!

193
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,321
That's his real body.

194
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:22,786
After twenty years,
shall we face each other?

195
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,347
As I thought.

196
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,684
Just what I'd expect
from my old granny.

197
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:50,480
No wonder this little girl was able
to dodge my hidden weapons.

198
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:59,239
After all, the old lady who can see
past my attacks was controlling

199
00:19:59,641 --> 00:20:02,435
the little girl with chakra threads
used for the Puppet Master jutsu.

200
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,536
<i>He found out.</i>

201
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:09,875
What's more, you were so kind as to
attach threads of chakra to Hiruko's tail.

202
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,293
But to think that I'd notice it

203
00:20:15,318 --> 00:20:18,196
after the tail's motion had been
brought to a halt...

204
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,553
It was when you first attacked
with the kunai, wasn't it?

205
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,144
Threads of chakra attached
to the kunai

206
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,605
latched onto the tail
when it repelled the kunai.

207
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:35,567
I suppressed my chakra as much
as possible so as not to be seen,

208
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,819
and yet you still figured it out.

209
00:20:37,844 --> 00:20:39,346
I'm amazed.

210
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,158
But of course.

211
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:47,621
After all, the one who hammered
the principles of puppetry into me was...

212
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:48,997
none other than you.

213
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,332
Yes.

214
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,336
But the show ends today.

215
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,256
That is my intention as well.

216
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:07,015
Now then, I wonder if it'll
really be that simple...

217
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,726
Granny Chiyo...?

218
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,979
What is going on?

219
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:16,775
He's just as he was before...
He hasn't aged a bit.

220
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,739
<i>What's going on?!</i>

221
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:26,451
<i>I was told Sasori broke off from
the Hidden Sand 20 years ago...</i>

222
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,038
<i>There's no way that
he could be this young.</i>

223
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,253
You! Return Gaara to us!

224
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,672
It's only a matter of time

225
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:42,467
before Master Sasori finishes off
the group inside.

226
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,767
<i>If Master comes out,</i>

227
00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:55,554
<i>then the whole point of using this one
to draw out the Jinchuriki will be lost.</i>

228
00:22:00,146 --> 00:22:03,275
You jerk!
I won't let you get away.

229
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,115
Hold it right there!

230
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,034
Naruto, wait a minute!

231
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:11,121
Kakashi-sensei,
you go look after Sakura!

232
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:12,998
Good grief.

233
00:22:16,533 --> 00:22:19,328
While I'm at it,
I'll show you something special.

234
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:26,094
It's guaranteed to move you.

235
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:30,307
This one gave me quite a bit of trouble
to kill, but...

236
00:22:31,707 --> 00:22:32,708
Three...?

237
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:36,980
That's why I like this best of all.

238
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:49,440
Th-That... It couldn't be!

239
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,079
What? What's wrong?!

240
00:22:52,929 --> 00:22:56,558
That's... the Third Kazekage...

241
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:03,882
Then...

242
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:07,094
It was over ten years ago

243
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:10,472
that the Third Kazekage suddenly
disappeared from the village.

244
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:17,604
We scoured the countryside,
but we were never able to find him.

245
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,232
He was the most powerful
of all the Kazekage, but...

246
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:23,703
Sasori, you...?

247
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:25,987
And so what if I did?

248
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:29,346
Do you mean to say that a retired old lady
with one foot in the grave

249
00:23:29,371 --> 00:23:31,874
is about to avenge the Third Kazekage?

250
00:23:32,602 --> 00:23:34,312
Tough luck...

251
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,416
Retired, with one foot in the grave.
That may be so,

252
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,585
but it was worth dragging
my old bones out here.

253
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:44,756
I'd have too many regrets
if I were to die now.

254
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,842
It's bad enough that my grandson

255
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:50,260
got himself mixed up
with a bad crowd...

256
00:23:50,571 --> 00:23:52,531
but to think that you'd betray the village

257
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:55,809
and try to meddle with the Kazekage,
for the third time!

258
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,561
Third time?

259
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,152
It was Orochimaru
who killed Gaara's father,

260
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,821
the Fourth Kazekage, but...

261
00:24:08,298 --> 00:24:10,925
the one who guided them
was Sasori!

262
00:24:11,729 --> 00:24:16,525
And this time,
Gaara and even the Third Kazekage...

263
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:21,418
Hey, hey, I don't know anything
about the Fourth Kazekage.

264
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,671
The one who guided them
was my subordinate.

265
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:28,383
In that case, it's the same
as if you did it yourself.

266
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,178
Can you really say that
you were not involved?

267
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:35,932
Indeed, I was originally paired with
Orochimaru in the Akatsuki,

268
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,601
so I did lots of things but...

269
00:24:46,515 --> 00:24:50,477
If you were paired
with Orochimaru...

270
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,991
then that means you know
about Orochimaru.

271
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:57,120
In that case, there are a lot
of questions I need you to answer!

272
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:03,084
Unfortunately,
I must take you two out

273
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:06,070
and go capture that Jinchuriki.

274
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:09,216
I hate to keep people waiting,

275
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,885
so I have no time
to answer your questions.

276
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,806
Well then, shall we get right to it?

277
00:25:19,834 --> 00:25:20,835
<i>Here it comes!</i>

278
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,277
Die!

279
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,241
He's fast!

280
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,627
<i>To think that Hiruko's tail
fell to pieces...</i>

281
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,129
You've got some pretty good moves,
Granny Chiyo.

282
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,632
In that case, how about this?

283
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:57,639
Oh no!

284
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:58,723
Take this!

285
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:22,330
<i>With the old lady manipulating things,
it's impossible to get anywhere.</i>

286
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:27,794
In that case...

287
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,805
Oh, no! Sakura! Hold your breath!

288
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,098
<i>Is it poison?!</i>

289
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,862
It's a kunai with a rope attached.

290
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,240
You should have repelled it,
rather than dodged it.

291
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,244
<i>I can't hold my breath...</i>

292
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,121
Sakura!

293
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:07,000
<i>I... can't die...</i>

294
00:27:07,544 --> 00:27:08,753
<i>in a place like this!</i>

295
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:14,507
What!

296
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:17,802
Sakura!

297
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,848
Not bad...

298
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,144
<i>She...</i>

299
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:29,397
<i>Did she use the blast waves
of a paper bomb</i>

300
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,316
<i>to blow away the poisonous smoke?</i>

301
00:27:32,638 --> 00:27:35,933
<i>Along with herself in it,
escaping the trap in the process...</i>

302
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:39,366
<i>How reckless of her...!</i>

303
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:46,539
You...!

304
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,418
I will capture you!

305
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,926
Even if my arms and legs
were to be blown off...

306
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,306
Even if I were to swallow poison
and become immobile...

307
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,850
I will capture you, no matter what!

308
00:28:06,972 --> 00:28:08,849
No matter how much
you might resist...

309
00:28:09,505 --> 00:28:11,257
No matter what tricks
you come up with...

310
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,901
I will make you tell me everything
about Orochimaru!

311
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,486
You hear me?!

312
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:27,664
Huh?!

313
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:35,797
When a woman is talking,
a man should listen quietly.

314
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,594
Oh... those things...

315
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:43,638
That's right...

316
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:47,642
They're the first puppets
you ever made.

317
00:28:53,425 --> 00:28:54,634
The father and...

318
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,235
the mother.

319
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,534
So what do you plan to do
with those now, huh?

320
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:09,622
Those are puppets I made.
I know all their tricks.

321
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,065
This is stupid...

322
00:29:38,105 --> 00:29:40,607
Sakura! Stand back!

323
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,030
Okay!

324
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:06,573
Amazing...

325
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:51,200
This is getting messy...
I better hurry up and use this thing.

326
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:07,300
As I thought, that puppet...
uses the Third Kazekage's jutsu...!

327
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:10,458
You haven't seen this in
a while, have you...?

328
00:32:10,577 --> 00:32:15,874
This jutsu is why the Third Kazekage
was praised as the most powerful.

329
00:32:16,888 --> 00:32:18,973
I'm going to turn you guys into mush.

330
00:32:20,161 --> 00:32:21,329
What the hell is that?

331
00:32:21,893 --> 00:32:25,313
That was the most feared weapon
of the Hidden Sand.

332
00:32:26,405 --> 00:32:27,614
The Iron Sand.

333
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:29,948
Iron Sand...?

334
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:34,285
The Third developed that jutsu

335
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:39,248
by adapting the technique used by
Shukaku's former host.

336
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:43,127
It changes the Iron Sand
into various shapes,

337
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:46,172
creating weapons according
to the situation.

338
00:32:46,697 --> 00:32:49,575
The Third Kazekage had a special body

339
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,812
that could change the chakra
into magnetism.

340
00:32:54,709 --> 00:32:56,866
Similarly, it appears that puppet

341
00:32:56,891 --> 00:33:00,311
also can change the chakra
into magnetism.

342
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:01,771
What do you mean?

343
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,775
Even though the actual body of
The Third Kazekage was used,

344
00:33:06,189 --> 00:33:08,938
it's still just a puppet, right?

345
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,073
Why does a puppet have chakra?

346
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:16,995
No... A Human Puppet made
from an actual living body

347
00:33:17,566 --> 00:33:19,597
is fundamentally different
from these normal ones

348
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:23,167
like the "mother" and
"father" puppets.

349
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:26,170
A Human Puppet can only
be made by Sasori...

350
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:31,676
and that is made while the person's
chakra still resides within them.

351
00:33:33,557 --> 00:33:39,313
And by doing so, it can use the person's
jutsu from its previous life.

352
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:44,439
That's the biggest benefit
of the "Human Puppet."

353
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,442
That's not all.

354
00:33:48,898 --> 00:33:52,276
After all,
this is my favorite collection.

355
00:33:53,805 --> 00:33:57,392
Sakura, get out of here.

356
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:01,330
I will take care of the rest.

357
00:34:02,349 --> 00:34:04,529
This is way too unexpected.

358
00:34:05,393 --> 00:34:08,771
You stand no chance against that puppet.

359
00:34:09,626 --> 00:34:10,335
But!

360
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,737
You're too slow!

361
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,919
<i>Iron Sand: Scattered Showers!</i>

362
00:34:32,209 --> 00:34:36,547
Did you alter it a little?
A chakra shield, huh?

363
00:34:37,837 --> 00:34:41,735
Looks like it's been upgraded compared
to the time I was playing with them.

364
00:34:57,802 --> 00:35:00,972
<i>As expected, due to
the Iron Sand, my moves...</i>

365
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:07,230
Don't you know that you have to dodge
this jutsu and not shield it?

366
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,983
Seems like you could barely
let the girl escape.

367
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:19,450
I inserted the Iron Sand
into his entire body.

368
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:24,580
As long as I have the Third's magnetism,
that one's done for.

369
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:29,377
Let's see... I will aim at both
of you and attack at once.

370
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:35,299
In order to ensure a definite kill,
I will form it into a lethal weapon.

371
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:51,649
I won't let you get away
a second time...

372
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:00,334
With only one puppet,
you can't guard both of you.

373
00:36:01,155 --> 00:36:03,032
What are you going to do, Granny?

374
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:07,081
Which one of you will die?!

375
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:32,023
Though only the arm...
Turning your own body into a puppet...

376
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:41,407
As fellow Puppet Masters,
it seems... we think the same way.

377
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:50,541
I see. I get it now...

378
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:58,841
It's the end if the Iron Sand gets in.

379
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,999
Let's see...
The puppet has ceased.

380
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,764
What are you going to do,
Granny Chiyo?

381
00:37:17,044 --> 00:37:19,755
Even the world's greatest Puppet Master...

382
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:22,406
is nothing, but an ordinary person
without her puppets.

383
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:55,856
Grandma Chiyo...

384
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,654
Please use me!

385
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,950
<i>What I can do now...</i>

386
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:10,788
<i>is to become Grandma Chiyo's
puppet and fight.</i>

387
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:16,043
If you use me, he can't stop
my moves with the Iron Sand.

388
00:38:19,201 --> 00:38:21,286
I am left with one arm.

389
00:38:21,761 --> 00:38:24,222
I can't support you like before.

390
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,262
I'm okay...

391
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:31,350
True, I don't have a great weapon
like the puppet, but...

392
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:38,357
Like my master, I have guts!

393
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,611
<i>Princess Tsunade, huh...</i>

394
00:38:47,662 --> 00:38:49,873
The Third's power is magnetism.

395
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:54,457
Therefore, weapons made from
iron and steel won't work.

396
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:00,713
Excellent! Like my master, I fight best
with my fists.

397
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:03,591
That again... Ridiculous.

398
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:39,126
Here I go!

399
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,222
You...

400
00:40:03,173 --> 00:40:05,091
Here I come!

401
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:12,201
Sasori's going to get mad at me again
for not being prepared enough...

402
00:40:13,693 --> 00:40:17,390
But it's not my style to think
about every little detail

403
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,500
and always be perfectly prepared.

404
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:22,169
Dealing with matters with
a flexible mindset,

405
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:24,213
no matter what the situation,

406
00:40:24,873 --> 00:40:29,795
leads to developing sophistication
as an artist.

407
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,140
What should I do?

408
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:36,517
Listen up, Naruto.

409
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,978
You're not accustomed to
that kind of enemy.

410
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:43,474
Not only that, he's a long-range type,
the worst match for someone like you;

411
00:40:43,933 --> 00:40:46,694
who specializes in close-range battle.

412
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:52,575
There are only two ways to
defeat this type of enemy.

413
00:40:53,694 --> 00:40:57,872
One is to draw the enemy into a
close-range fight and defeat them...

414
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:03,043
The other is to outdo the enemy with
a long-range attack and defeat them.

415
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:05,671
But, how do we do that...?

416
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:08,340
No matter which method is taken,

417
00:41:08,615 --> 00:41:11,569
your squad needs either a comrade
who specializes in long-range attacks

418
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:17,016
or one who can use support ninjutsu
for long-range battles.

419
00:41:18,868 --> 00:41:24,082
In the event of having neither...
it's impossible to defeat the enemy.

420
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:29,778
Well, it'd be different if you were
as smart as Shikamaru, though.

421
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,947
Stop beating around the bush!

422
00:41:32,009 --> 00:41:33,802
If that's the case, then what about
you Kakashi-sensei...?

423
00:41:33,868 --> 00:41:36,204
Oh... me, huh?

424
00:41:37,282 --> 00:41:39,117
A Jonin who's as smart as Shikamaru

425
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:43,501
and possesses support ninjutsu
for long-range battles.

426
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:45,836
Then we've got what we need!

427
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:48,047
That's why I told you to calm down.

428
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,715
Then we should get right to it...

429
00:41:49,865 --> 00:41:51,867
It won't work out that easily.

430
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:56,722
He won't leave himself open
if we just chase him around.

431
00:41:58,824 --> 00:42:01,952
All we can do is create
an opening from our end.

432
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,772
You and me together.

433
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:12,644
If you were able to
catch on to what I said,

434
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,781
then lend me an ear.

435
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,075
I'll tell you the plan.

436
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:28,223
She's got impressive strength
for a little girl.

437
00:42:33,074 --> 00:42:34,742
<i>In just this short time,</i>

438
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:38,305
<i>she's starting to read
Sasori's attack patterns.</i>

439
00:42:39,045 --> 00:42:42,716
<i>So much so, that she can do just fine
even without my help.</i>

440
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:46,335
<i>I never thought she would be
this good...</i>

441
00:42:48,394 --> 00:42:50,480
<i>She's an impressive girl.</i>

442
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:12,881
<i>His fingers always move
before he attacks...</i>

443
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,968
<i>That's obvious since
he's controlling the puppet</i>

444
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,470
<i>with the chakra strings on his fingers...</i>

445
00:43:19,017 --> 00:43:21,060
<i>But that's the weakness
of a Puppet Master.</i>

446
00:43:26,566 --> 00:43:29,319
<i>And I've started to read
the direction of Sasori's attacks</i>

447
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:32,151
<i>with the patterns of his finger
and arm movements.</i>

448
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,528
<i>She's watching very carefully...</i>

449
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,239
<i>At this rate,
this will be too time-consuming...</i>

450
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:40,200
<i>I have no choice
but to use some chakra.</i>

451
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:41,994
<i>I guess I'll finish her off with that...</i>

452
00:43:52,077 --> 00:43:53,495
<i>Iron Sand: Unleash!</i>

453
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:03,307
<i>Its range is huge!</i>

454
00:44:03,889 --> 00:44:04,682
This is not good!

455
00:44:43,545 --> 00:44:45,505
Sakura, are you okay?!

456
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,412
She's been poisoned!

457
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:10,916
Didn't I tell you...
"That's not all there is"?

458
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:15,547
As I suspected, he laced the
Iron Sand with poison...

459
00:45:24,378 --> 00:45:26,088
The poison is starting to take effect...

460
00:45:30,762 --> 00:45:33,669
Soon your body will go numb
and you won't be able to move.

461
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,612
If left untreated, you have
three days to live...

462
00:45:41,091 --> 00:45:43,010
But I've got no intention of doing that!

463
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:51,498
Sakura!

464
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:18,150
Grandma Chiyo.

465
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,027
<i>What's going on...?</i>

466
00:46:23,588 --> 00:46:25,639
Sakura... You...

467
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,911
I used an antidote.

468
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,382
When did you... get such a thing...?

469
00:46:39,175 --> 00:46:42,053
When I made the antidote for Kankuro
in the Village Hidden in the Sand...

470
00:46:43,304 --> 00:46:45,598
I knew the enemy would use poison,

471
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,306
so I made the other two into injections
and brought them with me.

472
00:46:50,907 --> 00:46:53,243
I see... So that's how...

473
00:46:53,565 --> 00:46:56,187
Yes, I used one of the two.

474
00:46:57,397 --> 00:47:01,360
However, the effects of the antidote
will only last around three minutes.

475
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:04,738
No matter how often I get hit
with poison during that time,

476
00:47:04,763 --> 00:47:08,642
the effects of the medicine will turn
all of it into harmless proteins.

477
00:47:09,354 --> 00:47:13,941
I couldn't let Sasori find out
that I had this antidote...

478
00:47:15,807 --> 00:47:18,042
I knew I'd have an opportunity

479
00:47:18,067 --> 00:47:20,612
after he revealed his final intentions
and let his guard down.

480
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:24,216
So I couldn't use it until
the very last moment.

481
00:47:31,446 --> 00:47:34,032
Now there's only one left...

482
00:47:35,959 --> 00:47:38,253
I will hand this over to you,
Grandma Chiyo.

483
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:39,613
Right...

484
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:41,984
Are you okay?!

485
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:49,506
<i>Don't tell me
the poison was neutralized...</i>

486
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:57,668
<i>If you want to live that badly,
I won't finish you off.</i>

487
00:47:58,418 --> 00:48:03,178
<i>However, that poison will kill you
in less than three days...</i>

488
00:48:06,656 --> 00:48:10,326
<i>Don't tell me they analyzed the components
using the poison from back then...</i>

489
00:48:11,102 --> 00:48:12,895
<i>No, that couldn't be.</i>

490
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:16,787
<i>Even if by some chance they were able
to analyze the components,</i>

491
00:48:17,364 --> 00:48:19,909
<i>they shouldn't be able to
make an antidote that easily.</i>

492
00:48:21,448 --> 00:48:23,617
<i>The concoction of an antidote
is so difficult</i>

493
00:48:23,642 --> 00:48:26,228
<i>that even the slightest mistake
is not permissible.</i>

494
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:28,363
<i>Even I, who made the poison,</i>

495
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,365
<i>needed a precise formula
for the mixture...</i>

496
00:48:31,668 --> 00:48:32,877
I'll heal you now.

497
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:46,548
Now poison won't affect me for
the next three minutes.

498
00:48:47,892 --> 00:48:49,997
Everything depends on
those three minutes!

499
00:48:50,799 --> 00:48:51,800
Right...

500
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:58,060
<i>Grandma, huh...?</i>

501
00:48:59,837 --> 00:49:04,617
<i>No, I'm the only one with that level
of medical skill in the Sand Village.</i>

502
00:49:05,223 --> 00:49:07,176
<i>I made a poison that</i>

503
00:49:07,201 --> 00:49:10,747
<i>even she wouldn't be able to
immediately create an antidote for.</i>

504
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:19,498
<i>So this kid's also
a medical ninja, huh...?</i>

505
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:23,156
<i>If I recall, she's from the Leaf...</i>

506
00:49:25,909 --> 00:49:32,022
<i>The Leaf's Hokage, Tsunade,
is a legendary medical ninja...</i>

507
00:49:37,761 --> 00:49:41,181
<i>Don't tell me...
she made the antidote...?!</i>

508
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:48,860
Sakura, my left hand's okay now.

509
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:50,901
O-Okay...

510
00:49:54,773 --> 00:49:55,774
<i>For the time being,</i>

511
00:49:56,102 --> 00:49:58,021
<i>I stopped the bleeding
of the large wounds...</i>

512
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,344
<i>I'll use all of my remaining chakra
to attack!</i>

513
00:50:03,953 --> 00:50:05,830
<i>If I don't finish this during
the next three minutes,</i>

514
00:50:05,931 --> 00:50:07,016
<i>there won't be a next time!</i>

515
00:50:11,076 --> 00:50:12,161
We don't have any time.

516
00:50:12,512 --> 00:50:14,562
Can you fight right away,
Grandma Chiyo?

517
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,639
Let's go, Sakura!

518
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,391
Right!

519
00:50:20,747 --> 00:50:25,418
<i>Heh... I'll admit it.
You're an impressive kid.</i>

520
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:31,111
<i>Who would've thought she could destroy
my Third Kazekage puppet...</i>

521
00:50:32,847 --> 00:50:35,766
<i>It's useless to use
other Human Puppets any longer.</i>

522
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:41,455
I haven't used this since
I joined the Akatsuki...

523
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:44,502
I can't remember when that was...

524
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:47,836
Wh-What's that?!

525
00:50:48,838 --> 00:50:54,760
He hasn't aged at all since
he left my side.

526
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,556
He's exactly the same as before...

527
00:51:03,722 --> 00:51:06,658
And that's the reason why...

528
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,609
It's really been a long time...

529
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:13,653
since I used myself.

530
00:51:18,828 --> 00:51:19,996
He turned himself...

531
00:51:21,116 --> 00:51:22,367
into a Human Puppet.

532
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:33,423
Got it?

533
00:51:33,448 --> 00:51:35,116
Yeah, I got it!

534
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:37,427
Let's go.

535
00:51:42,024 --> 00:51:44,239
If you're not going to attack me...

536
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:49,356
<i>The effects of the antidote
will last less than two minutes.</i>

537
00:51:52,602 --> 00:51:55,504
<i>During that time... somehow, I need
to turn this into a close-range battle</i>

538
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:57,073
<i>and then finish him off...</i>

539
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:01,034
Then I'll make the first move!

540
00:52:08,065 --> 00:52:09,483
It's useless to hide!

541
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,261
What's the matter...?
Aren't you going to attack?

542
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,186
<i>The effects of the antidote
will last one more minute...</i>

543
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:30,772
Then...

544
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:35,777
Water?

545
00:52:35,955 --> 00:52:37,415
Sakura! Get away!

546
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:00,802
There!

547
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,696
<i>Fifteen seconds... left...</i>

548
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:27,996
You little—!

549
00:53:32,649 --> 00:53:34,317
Cha!

550
00:53:36,396 --> 00:53:37,397
<i>Three seconds.</i>

551
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:40,884
<i>Two!</i>

552
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:57,394
We did it.

553
00:53:57,862 --> 00:54:01,157
Grandma Chiyo, we did it!

554
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:03,156
Sakura...

555
00:54:04,095 --> 00:54:05,096
You...

556
00:54:49,291 --> 00:54:50,751
What did you do?

557
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,793
That's right.

558
00:55:08,854 --> 00:55:10,856
The fight is just beginning.

559
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:19,149
This is a jutsu I myself sealed...

560
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:24,863
I didn't think I'd ever use it again...

561
00:55:26,751 --> 00:55:28,920
But it seems it won't work out
that way.

562
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:33,219
Now let's put an end to this.

563
00:56:00,973 --> 00:56:04,544
It's said the ability of
a puppet master is measured

564
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:07,280
by the number of puppets they can use...

565
00:56:07,848 --> 00:56:09,391
I'd expect nothing less from you, old hag.

566
00:56:10,389 --> 00:56:11,932
Th-There's so many...

567
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:14,070
Ten of them.

568
00:56:14,255 --> 00:56:16,732
Granny Chiyo's secret technique,
the "Ten Fingers."

569
00:56:17,836 --> 00:56:19,380
I'd heard rumors about it...

570
00:56:21,081 --> 00:56:24,751
The device you used to bring down
a castle by yourself...

571
00:56:25,532 --> 00:56:28,493
The Secret White Move:
Chikamatsu's 10 Puppets.

572
00:56:29,387 --> 00:56:31,806
The ten masterpieces by Monzaemon,

573
00:56:32,363 --> 00:56:34,866
the creator of the Puppet Master Jutsu...

574
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,601
It's a great collection of puppets.

575
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:39,896
However...

576
00:56:58,665 --> 00:56:59,666
I...

577
00:56:59,938 --> 00:57:02,191
used this to bring down a nation!

578
00:57:09,350 --> 00:57:11,968
<i>He's become... this powerful...</i>

579
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:16,349
I'm appalled at myself.

580
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:20,895
How long am I going to have to fight
a little girl and an old hag...?

581
00:57:23,545 --> 00:57:26,840
I never thought I'd have to
bring out my final device...

582
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:38,121
<i>Secret Red Move: Performance
of a Hundred Puppets...</i>

583
00:57:38,709 --> 00:57:40,127
I'll show you...

584
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:43,851
But let's make this the final act.

585
00:57:44,829 --> 00:57:45,955
Are you ready?

586
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:47,755
Yes!

587
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:51,885
Here he comes!

588
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:08,711
<i>With this many of them...</i>

589
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,297
<i>The only way to thin their numbers</i>

590
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,882
<i>is to fight them one-on-one somehow...</i>

591
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:25,687
All right!

592
00:59:37,298 --> 00:59:38,883
<i>There are too many of them!</i>

593
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:17,363
Are you okay, Sakura?!

594
01:00:17,733 --> 01:00:18,734
I'm okay!

595
01:00:18,985 --> 01:00:20,320
Stay sharp!

596
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:21,576
Right!

597
01:00:22,528 --> 01:00:25,364
<i>There definitely aren't
as many of Sasori's puppets now...</i>

598
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:32,045
<i>But conversely, it looks like he's
concentrating more on each puppet now.</i>

599
01:00:32,677 --> 01:00:35,482
<i>And on top of that,
we only have one antidote left.</i>

600
01:00:36,022 --> 01:00:40,318
<i>Things will get tough in a hurry
if either Sakura or I get wounded.</i>

601
01:00:42,845 --> 01:00:43,846
Grandma Chiyo!

602
01:00:43,935 --> 01:00:44,936
Oh no...!

603
01:00:51,049 --> 01:00:52,675
Are you okay, Grandma Chiyo?

604
01:00:53,589 --> 01:00:55,716
You don't need to worry about me!

605
01:00:56,192 --> 01:00:58,677
More importantly, aim for Sasori.

606
01:00:59,493 --> 01:01:01,852
I'll keep the other puppets in check!

607
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:03,881
Right!

608
01:01:24,918 --> 01:01:26,678
Sakura, use that!

609
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:19,469
Here!

610
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:02,111
We did it!

611
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:06,532
You can't move.

612
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:10,828
That seal completely
suppresses one's chakra.

613
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:13,748
You can't use
your chakra threads anymore.

614
01:03:15,168 --> 01:03:17,295
It's over, Sasori...

615
01:03:19,252 --> 01:03:20,253
Grandma Chiyo!

616
01:03:20,554 --> 01:03:21,555
Use the antidote quickly!

617
01:04:01,923 --> 01:04:05,177
<i>That kid... has totally calmed down...</i>

618
01:04:05,985 --> 01:04:07,153
<i>What's he planning?</i>

619
01:04:15,476 --> 01:04:17,603
Kakashi-sensei!
Aren't you ready yet?!

620
01:04:18,148 --> 01:04:19,441
Be patient...

621
01:04:21,472 --> 01:04:24,016
I don't have as much chakra
as you, after all...

622
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:27,196
It's going to take time.

623
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:49,552
Sakura!

624
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:53,931
Grandma Chiyo!

625
01:04:54,946 --> 01:04:55,947
Are you okay?

626
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:57,894
Can you still move?

627
01:04:59,186 --> 01:05:02,732
Oh? Worrying about others
with a wound like that?

628
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:07,720
<i>Sasori... How...?</i>

629
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:10,531
Don't tell me...

630
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:27,423
<i>She's... stopping the bleeding</i>

631
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:29,926
<i>and healing herself with a sword
still stuck in her body.</i>

632
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:31,886
<i>She's skilled.</i>

633
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:37,892
Grandma Chiyo, I'm okay.

634
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:40,728
So hurry up and
take the antidote.

635
01:05:42,383 --> 01:05:43,384
Sakura.

636
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:52,323
It looks like the poison
is starting to take effect.

637
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:56,619
Of course, this sword
is also poisoned, you see.

638
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:00,081
<i>My body's getting numb
from the poison,</i>

639
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:02,708
<i>so I can't control
my chakra very well.</i>

640
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:22,186
<i>So that's the antidote.</i>

641
01:06:24,852 --> 01:06:25,853
Why?

642
01:06:29,129 --> 01:06:31,120
Grandma... Chiyo.

643
01:06:32,446 --> 01:06:36,200
<i>I can't believe how everyone chooses
death for the sake of others...</i>

644
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:38,369
<i>How stupid...</i>

645
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:44,667
I won't let go.

646
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:51,298
<i>This girl's got... incredible strength.</i>

647
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:54,552
Grandma Chiyo!

648
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:58,347
<i>It's futile to engage in
a contest of strength with her.</i>

649
01:06:59,932 --> 01:07:00,933
<i>Then...</i>

650
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:10,234
Die!

651
01:07:32,789 --> 01:07:36,751
You lowered your guard
at the end, Sasori.

652
01:07:37,589 --> 01:07:38,590
What?

653
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:51,778
Now you can't move.

654
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:54,361
Am I right?

655
01:07:55,487 --> 01:07:58,365
Although you may have
the body of a puppet,

656
01:07:58,890 --> 01:08:03,978
you still use chakra, so you need
a living core...

657
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:07,041
That's your weakness.

658
01:08:07,957 --> 01:08:16,258
And the only thing missing from that shell
is the core from your left chest.

659
01:08:18,625 --> 01:08:22,838
You switched...
to a different puppet.

660
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:31,607
The body of a puppet
is just an empty shell.

661
01:08:32,149 --> 01:08:33,995
Your real body...

662
01:08:36,587 --> 01:08:39,965
is the core in your chest that
produces chakra.

663
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:47,498
Sakura!

664
01:08:56,563 --> 01:08:57,968
<i>This is not good.</i>

665
01:08:59,176 --> 01:09:02,138
<i>In any event, I've got to
pull out this sword</i>

666
01:09:02,179 --> 01:09:04,807
<i>while closing the wound.</i>

667
01:09:18,195 --> 01:09:19,822
Hang in there.

668
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:25,536
Just a little more.

669
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:33,377
It's useless. I struck a vital point.

670
01:09:34,095 --> 01:09:37,390
She'll die soon, even without the poison.

671
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,882
She's lost too much blood.

672
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:43,596
Since you're also a medical ninja,

673
01:09:44,054 --> 01:09:47,433
I aimed for a spot
you can't easily heal.

674
01:09:48,058 --> 01:09:53,230
I've already administered first aid
with my medical ninjutsu.

675
01:09:53,691 --> 01:09:58,120
What I'm doing right now
isn't medical ninjutsu.

676
01:09:58,819 --> 01:09:59,820
What?

677
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:04,825
I'm giving her
my own life energy.

678
01:10:05,689 --> 01:10:06,815
Don't tell me...

679
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:10,080
It's a Reincarnation Jutsu!

680
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:14,251
A Reincarnation Jutsu?

681
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:20,952
It's a jutsu I spent years creating
originally for you...

682
01:10:20,977 --> 01:10:22,979
one that only I can use.

683
01:10:28,098 --> 01:10:30,017
With this jutsu...

684
01:10:30,206 --> 01:10:34,127
life can even be given to puppets.

685
01:10:38,014 --> 01:10:42,227
But only in exchange for the
caster's own life...

686
01:10:50,996 --> 01:10:52,495
<i>Sasori.</i>

687
01:10:55,440 --> 01:11:02,447
But now I see, it's a dream
that will never come true...

688
01:11:07,122 --> 01:11:08,665
How stupid...

689
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:24,697
Have a safe trip.

690
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:38,002
It... It can't be...!

691
01:11:41,694 --> 01:11:46,490
Damn you...
White Fang of the Leaf!

692
01:12:06,361 --> 01:12:07,487
Grandma Chiyo!

693
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:10,868
Are Mommy and Daddy back?

694
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:19,201
They're not?

695
01:12:19,759 --> 01:12:27,433
W-Well, your mommy and daddy were
suddenly sent on another mission...

696
01:12:28,431 --> 01:12:32,810
It looks like they won't be back
for a little while.

697
01:12:35,775 --> 01:12:40,589
I just heard from them and they want
you to wait with me for them to return.

698
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:43,192
Can you wait, Sasori?

699
01:12:44,612 --> 01:12:45,613
Yeah.

700
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:54,930
Sasori! How've you been?

701
01:13:55,013 --> 01:13:56,014
Huh?

702
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:04,356
Granny Chiyo said
your last puppet was incredible.

703
01:14:05,023 --> 01:14:07,014
Someday, I want to be
a shinobi like you,

704
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:08,666
where everyone praises my puppets...

705
01:14:12,072 --> 01:14:13,740
Hey! Are you listening?!

706
01:14:14,492 --> 01:14:16,369
Hey, it's me!

707
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:18,537
Komushi has come to see you!

708
01:14:22,207 --> 01:14:24,293
Hey! Answer me!

709
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:36,388
H-Hey, I didn't mean it.
I'm sorry.

710
01:14:37,181 --> 01:14:40,267
But you're treating me worse
than a puppet.

711
01:14:43,228 --> 01:14:45,397
Oh well, I guess I'll be
waiting forever

712
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:47,274
to get a response from you.

713
01:14:49,401 --> 01:14:51,278
I have a message from Granny Chiyo.

714
01:14:51,945 --> 01:14:53,797
She wants the puppets
she ordered finished soon...

715
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:56,492
The Crow, Black Ant and Salamander...

716
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:57,701
Oh...

717
01:15:00,433 --> 01:15:03,102
Everything she requested is done.

718
01:15:03,514 --> 01:15:05,558
Oh, so these are your new creations.

719
01:15:05,959 --> 01:15:06,793
That was so quick...

720
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:08,462
I don't like to keep people waiting.

721
01:15:09,421 --> 01:15:11,298
Yeah... That's true.

722
01:15:20,265 --> 01:15:22,643
Hey... That's amazing.

723
01:15:23,238 --> 01:15:24,781
They look so human!

724
01:15:34,571 --> 01:15:36,782
Oh, I almost forgot.

725
01:15:37,741 --> 01:15:39,210
About your new creation...

726
01:15:39,235 --> 01:15:42,613
She asked me to ask about
the poison for the Crow puppet.

727
01:15:45,055 --> 01:15:46,056
Huh?

728
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:52,381
These are all rare medicinal plants!

729
01:15:53,298 --> 01:15:55,133
You're going to make poison out of these?

730
01:15:57,493 --> 01:15:59,996
This is going to require permission.

731
01:16:00,467 --> 01:16:01,381
All right!

732
01:16:01,406 --> 01:16:04,409
I, Komushi, will handle the negotiations!
Just give me some time.

733
01:16:04,434 --> 01:16:05,852
I don't want to wait.

734
01:16:06,186 --> 01:16:08,480
I guess not. Then let's go!

735
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:18,824
It's me, Komushi!

736
01:16:19,491 --> 01:16:20,784
What is it?

737
01:16:21,326 --> 01:16:24,204
Oh... Did you relay my message...?

738
01:16:28,232 --> 01:16:30,776
Granny Chiyo, Sasori has a request.

739
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:33,130
What is it?

740
01:16:39,492 --> 01:16:41,119
There's not much I can say

741
01:16:41,144 --> 01:16:43,104
without knowing the formula
for the poison.

742
01:16:52,065 --> 01:16:55,027
But since this is coming from you,
I have no issues with it.

743
01:16:55,473 --> 01:16:58,017
I'll clear it with
the Pharmaceuticals Division.

744
01:16:58,344 --> 01:17:02,382
I'm busy with my research,
so you can go now.

745
01:17:03,811 --> 01:17:06,563
Ahhh... you've got it made, Sasori.

746
01:17:06,913 --> 01:17:09,833
You're still young, but you're already
contributing to the village.

747
01:17:10,703 --> 01:17:12,913
Granny Chiyo must be so proud of you.

748
01:17:15,203 --> 01:17:16,371
Are you listening to me?

749
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:20,177
Granny Chiyo is always
worried about you.

750
01:17:20,677 --> 01:17:24,097
I can't wait to be acknowledged
as a full-fledged shinobi...

751
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:25,849
just like your puppets!

752
01:17:27,392 --> 01:17:30,437
My own parents still treat me
like a kid!

753
01:17:30,896 --> 01:17:33,023
They tell me I'm not suited
to being a shinobi...

754
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:36,546
But this time,
I was assigned to border security.

755
01:17:37,272 --> 01:17:40,066
It's just guard duty,
but if I can prove myself...

756
01:17:40,091 --> 01:17:41,092
Komushi!

757
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:43,467
What have you been doing
at this hour?!

758
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:44,701
I was so worried!

759
01:17:44,826 --> 01:17:46,995
Wait... Cut it out,
you're embarrassing me!

760
01:17:47,037 --> 01:17:49,081
I'm going to be assigned border
security missions from now on...

761
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:51,333
You can turn down things
like missions!

762
01:17:51,392 --> 01:17:53,644
I'll take care of you
for the rest of my life.

763
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:55,253
Mom, stop it!

764
01:18:05,138 --> 01:18:06,431
Thanks, Sasori!

765
01:18:07,391 --> 01:18:10,894
I heard that you were injured on duty?

766
01:18:11,535 --> 01:18:13,037
I messed up.

767
01:18:13,197 --> 01:18:14,198
But...

768
01:18:15,972 --> 01:18:18,475
That's... a puppet arm!

769
01:18:18,924 --> 01:18:20,468
That's not all!

770
01:18:24,074 --> 01:18:26,034
I feel stronger than before.

771
01:18:26,827 --> 01:18:29,162
And it fits perfectly.

772
01:18:29,729 --> 01:18:32,523
It feels like it's always been
a part of my body.

773
01:18:47,889 --> 01:18:50,392
How could you poison yourself?!

774
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:53,437
Granny Chiyo...

775
01:18:53,687 --> 01:18:56,440
He's... He's not to blame.

776
01:18:57,653 --> 01:19:00,238
I'm the one... who messed up...

777
01:19:02,446 --> 01:19:04,156
Where is Sasori?!

778
01:19:04,181 --> 01:19:06,308
Do we have the formula
for the poison yet?

779
01:19:15,343 --> 01:19:16,719
Please heal him...

780
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:18,628
Please heal him...

781
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:21,715
Heal him! Please!

782
01:19:22,869 --> 01:19:25,121
You attached his right arm too, right?

783
01:19:25,366 --> 01:19:27,410
Then his left arm can be...

784
01:19:28,513 --> 01:19:30,515
His legs, his body...

785
01:19:30,830 --> 01:19:33,183
You can even heal his soul, can't you?!

786
01:19:33,977 --> 01:19:35,228
Give him back to me!

787
01:19:35,312 --> 01:19:39,191
Heal my Komushi and
give him back to me!

788
01:19:50,130 --> 01:19:51,799
I don't like to make people wait.

789
01:19:52,588 --> 01:19:56,374
I expected you to have made
more progress by now.

790
01:19:57,083 --> 01:19:59,252
Sasori! What are you doing?!

791
01:19:59,277 --> 01:20:02,071
You barely got it to
the standard size...

792
01:20:02,334 --> 01:20:03,501
Sasori!

793
01:20:11,723 --> 01:20:13,391
It's Komushi?!

794
01:20:36,581 --> 01:20:38,124
As requested...

795
01:20:38,416 --> 01:20:40,335
The specimen is complete.

796
01:20:51,832 --> 01:20:53,333
How stupid.

797
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:57,394
When did you get so senile, granny?

798
01:21:04,401 --> 01:21:07,237
Sakura, are you okay?

799
01:21:07,612 --> 01:21:08,738
Yes.

800
01:21:10,091 --> 01:21:11,885
What about you, Grandma Chiyo?

801
01:21:13,614 --> 01:21:14,782
That's strange.

802
01:21:15,078 --> 01:21:17,622
I thought the caster of that
Reincarnation Jutsu or whatever

803
01:21:18,085 --> 01:21:20,796
was supposed to die

804
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:23,920
in exchange for breathing life
into someone dead.

805
01:21:24,178 --> 01:21:29,100
Sakura's wound was severe,
but she wasn't dead...

806
01:21:29,455 --> 01:21:32,875
So my life was spared.

807
01:21:33,945 --> 01:21:35,530
That's unfortunate.

808
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:41,563
I'd stop that.

809
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:44,562
This body doesn't
even feel pain.

810
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:51,781
The more you hit me,
the more your own fists will hurt.

811
01:21:54,495 --> 01:21:59,041
Women certainly like
to do pointless things.

812
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:03,043
I won't feel anything

813
01:22:03,068 --> 01:22:06,697
even if my own grandmother
were to die.

814
01:22:07,551 --> 01:22:09,970
My heart is just like this body.

815
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:13,970
I've killed hundreds, thousands of people.

816
01:22:14,590 --> 01:22:16,729
She'd be the same as one of them.

817
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:20,310
Things are simpler that way.

818
01:22:21,128 --> 01:22:24,006
What is a human life to you?!

819
01:22:24,856 --> 01:22:26,733
What is family to you?!

820
01:22:28,151 --> 01:22:31,863
Come on... Is that what
a shinobi should be saying?

821
01:22:34,509 --> 01:22:35,677
Sakura...

822
01:22:37,677 --> 01:22:38,970
That's enough.

823
01:22:39,913 --> 01:22:40,914
But...!

824
01:22:41,746 --> 01:22:49,079
It was the twisted customs of the
Sand Village that made him this way.

825
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:50,865
Granny Chiyo.

826
01:22:51,675 --> 01:22:54,177
Do you want to have
a body like this?

827
01:22:54,591 --> 01:22:55,717
If you did,

828
01:22:55,757 --> 01:22:59,010
you might understand
what I'm talking about.

829
01:22:59,516 --> 01:23:04,020
This body won't decay, and
it's not bound by a lifespan.

830
01:23:04,552 --> 01:23:07,847
A puppet can be recreated
over and over again.

831
01:23:08,590 --> 01:23:12,218
I can create as many people
as I want with puppets.

832
01:23:12,989 --> 01:23:15,033
If you want, that is...

833
01:23:18,368 --> 01:23:20,996
It's not just about increasing
the amount.

834
01:23:21,973 --> 01:23:24,100
A collection is all about quality.

835
01:23:25,442 --> 01:23:27,486
What the hell are you?!

836
01:23:30,964 --> 01:23:32,757
I'd venture to say

837
01:23:32,882 --> 01:23:36,761
I am a human who failed
to become a complete... puppet.

838
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:39,514
I'm a puppet,

839
01:23:39,709 --> 01:23:43,045
but an incomplete puppet
possessing a living core.

840
01:23:43,364 --> 01:23:46,784
I'm not a person...
nor am I a puppet.

841
01:23:47,894 --> 01:23:49,604
I'll soon stop moving.

842
01:23:50,984 --> 01:23:55,029
Before that, I think
I'll do something pointless...

843
01:23:56,406 --> 01:23:58,575
It's your reward for defeating me.

844
01:23:59,671 --> 01:24:03,967
You wanted to know
about Orochimaru, right?

845
01:24:07,304 --> 01:24:09,008
At midday in ten days,

846
01:24:09,033 --> 01:24:13,329
go to the Tenchi Bridge
in the Hidden Grass Village.

847
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:15,717
What do you mean?

848
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:18,595
I've got a spy working...

849
01:24:19,023 --> 01:24:21,192
as one of Orochimaru's
subordinates...

850
01:24:21,691 --> 01:24:27,614
I was supposed to rendezvous...
with him... there...

851
01:25:18,414 --> 01:25:21,166
It's over, Granny Chiyo.

852
01:25:26,384 --> 01:25:27,468
Excellent work.

853
01:25:29,749 --> 01:25:36,131
No. I was the one who should've...
been defeated.

854
01:25:36,940 --> 01:25:37,941
What?

855
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:43,471
Sasori read my final attack.

856
01:25:43,846 --> 01:25:46,975
But for some reason,
he didn't dodge it.

857
01:25:47,308 --> 01:25:50,228
A slight opening was revealed.

858
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:56,568
Could it be that he...?

859
01:26:07,763 --> 01:26:09,264
I'll heal you now!

860
01:26:15,378 --> 01:26:17,338
<i>I've got to do something...</i>

861
01:26:17,733 --> 01:26:19,360
<i>about the poison that
entered her body...</i>

862
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,552
Let's hurry back to the village.

863
01:26:23,216 --> 01:26:25,178
I'll make another antidote
immediately...

864
01:26:25,824 --> 01:26:26,867
No...

865
01:26:29,124 --> 01:26:30,125
Why?!

866
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:33,605
We've finished what
we were supposed to do.

867
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:36,024
We need to return to the village

868
01:26:36,424 --> 01:26:37,787
and make an antidote
for the poison immediately...

869
01:26:41,193 --> 01:26:42,820
More importantly...

870
01:26:43,401 --> 01:26:45,153
I've still got...

871
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:49,479
something I must... do.

872
01:26:55,921 --> 01:26:58,215
Kakashi-sensei,
aren't you ready yet?

873
01:26:58,918 --> 01:27:00,252
It's ready.

874
01:27:04,732 --> 01:27:06,650
That's what you were talking
about before?

875
01:27:07,551 --> 01:27:10,303
That's right.
It's my new Sharingan.

876
01:27:11,735 --> 01:27:12,736
Let's go, Naruto!

877
01:27:13,186 --> 01:27:14,187
Right!

878
01:27:19,952 --> 01:27:21,370
<i>Mangekyo Sharingan!</i>

879
01:27:53,142 --> 01:27:54,394
<i>A visual jutsu...?!</i>

880
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:01,651
<i>What is this jutsu...?</i>

881
01:28:03,508 --> 01:28:04,509
<i>It's amazing...</i>

882
01:28:13,413 --> 01:28:15,623
<i>My arm's getting sucked into space...?!</i>

883
01:28:15,695 --> 01:28:17,072
<i>What kind of jutsu is this?!</i>

884
01:28:32,557 --> 01:28:34,559
<i>I guess I still can't control
the location or size</i>

885
01:28:34,559 --> 01:28:36,394
<i>of the dimensional barrier very well...</i>

886
01:28:40,189 --> 01:28:42,233
<i>But I won't... miss next time...</i>

887
01:29:27,487 --> 01:29:28,571
<i>Rasengan!</i>

888
01:29:31,074 --> 01:29:32,450
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu.</i>

889
01:29:43,628 --> 01:29:44,375
Gaara!

890
01:29:52,238 --> 01:29:53,906
Gaara! Gaara!

891
01:29:54,764 --> 01:29:56,516
Kakashi-sensei, are you okay?

892
01:29:56,933 --> 01:29:58,935
Yeah... somehow...

893
01:30:04,514 --> 01:30:05,515
Gaara!

894
01:30:13,366 --> 01:30:15,785
Hey... Hey, Gaara!

895
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:23,126
<i>It was fine using the Kazekage
as bait to lure out the Jinchuriki.</i>

896
01:30:24,990 --> 01:30:26,200
<i>But I didn't plan on...</i>

897
01:30:29,197 --> 01:30:30,949
<i>him coming along...</i>

898
01:30:33,841 --> 01:30:34,925
<i>My left arm...</i>

899
01:30:36,412 --> 01:30:41,257
<i>was crushed by the Sand Jinchuriki.
Now my right arm, too...</i>

900
01:30:42,347 --> 01:30:44,224
<i>Now I can't even use a jutsu.</i>

901
01:30:45,543 --> 01:30:46,752
<i>I guess this is it...</i>

902
01:30:55,632 --> 01:31:00,053
<i>But... I never thought there was anyone
with dojutsu as good as Itachi.</i>

903
01:31:01,659 --> 01:31:03,911
<i>This Jinchuriki's nothing special.</i>

904
01:31:05,458 --> 01:31:07,877
<i>Kakashi's the more important issue...</i>

905
01:31:14,177 --> 01:31:16,053
I'll crush you!

906
01:31:17,096 --> 01:31:18,723
Fine, fine.

907
01:31:19,775 --> 01:31:22,236
I'll take you on again one of these days.

908
01:31:23,936 --> 01:31:25,229
You let your guard down...

909
01:31:50,922 --> 01:31:51,923
Naruto...

910
01:32:01,849 --> 01:32:04,352
It's clay... It was a substitution!

911
01:32:28,584 --> 01:32:30,336
<i>What is... that...?</i>

912
01:32:37,553 --> 01:32:40,348
<i>That's... what Master Jiraiya
was talking about...</i>

913
01:32:48,290 --> 01:32:49,959
<i>The Nine-Tails' Cloak...?</i>

914
01:33:02,702 --> 01:33:04,579
<i>So that's the Jinchuriki's...</i>

915
01:33:07,861 --> 01:33:12,658
<i>No wonder...
his punches were so hard...</i>

916
01:33:20,469 --> 01:33:21,804
It's so hot...!

917
01:33:38,551 --> 01:33:39,760
<i>Listen carefully, Kakashi.</i>

918
01:33:40,399 --> 01:33:41,775
At some point...

919
01:33:41,917 --> 01:33:45,337
the Nine-Tails' chakra may
leak out of Naruto's body...

920
01:33:45,536 --> 01:33:48,747
and take the form
of the Fox Spirit.

921
01:33:49,373 --> 01:33:51,709
The chakra will turn
into the Fox Spirit?!

922
01:33:52,543 --> 01:33:54,837
You can refer to it as
the Nine-Tails' Cloak.

923
01:33:56,418 --> 01:33:59,046
The Nine-Tails' Cloak...?

924
01:33:59,472 --> 01:34:00,473
Listen carefully...

925
01:34:00,754 --> 01:34:03,090
You must stop it while
there's still only one tail...

926
01:34:03,755 --> 01:34:05,132
If you don't...

927
01:34:06,293 --> 01:34:08,795
<i>you'll end up seeing
something frightening...</i>

928
01:34:31,374 --> 01:34:32,375
Right from the start...

929
01:34:35,586 --> 01:34:36,796
Calm down, Naruto!

930
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:46,305
<i>He's lost his ability
to think calmly and rationally.</i>

931
01:34:47,098 --> 01:34:49,100
<i>It's dangerous to
approach him carelessly...</i>

932
01:34:52,687 --> 01:34:55,981
<i>If the need arises... use this.</i>

933
01:35:00,076 --> 01:35:03,204
With this, you can immediately
suppress the chakra.

934
01:36:17,897 --> 01:36:19,190
He was formidable.

935
01:36:20,691 --> 01:36:23,068
 I'd expect no less from my imposter.

936
01:36:26,405 --> 01:36:28,157
Everyone! Have things been settled?

937
01:36:28,741 --> 01:36:29,909
<i>Yes, Guy-sensei!</i>

938
01:36:30,219 --> 01:36:31,553
<i>- Yeah...
- Naturally!</i>

939
01:36:32,161 --> 01:36:35,465
All right!
Let's go back up Team Kakashi!

940
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:38,501
- Roger!
- Roger!

941
01:36:49,678 --> 01:36:51,847
Have you calmed down, Naruto?

942
01:37:00,940 --> 01:37:03,859
<i>What in the world
did Master Jiraiya see?</i>

943
01:37:05,905 --> 01:37:08,116
<i>I got to see something pretty cool.</i>

944
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,502
<i>Someone's... coming...</i>

945
01:37:17,706 --> 01:37:18,833
We finally meet up.

946
01:37:19,458 --> 01:37:21,001
S-Sakura...

947
01:37:21,710 --> 01:37:23,265
Good job finding us.

948
01:37:24,030 --> 01:37:26,517
We felt a huge tremor earlier...

949
01:37:27,189 --> 01:37:30,317
You guys... did it, huh?

950
01:37:30,863 --> 01:37:31,864
Yeah...

951
01:37:32,797 --> 01:37:36,175
It looks like you're still...
having some trouble here...

952
01:37:37,185 --> 01:37:38,186
Unfortunately...

953
01:37:40,271 --> 01:37:42,439
What happened with Gaara...?

954
01:37:54,827 --> 01:37:55,828
All right...

955
01:37:59,206 --> 01:38:00,541
<i>Don't tell me...</i>

956
01:38:01,747 --> 01:38:05,567
<i>I can't believe Master Sasori got
beaten by a little girl and an old hag...</i>

957
01:38:06,547 --> 01:38:09,842
<i>"Eternal beauty that lasts forever,"
my ass.</i>

958
01:38:09,884 --> 01:38:11,510
<i>He goes and dies just like that...</i>

959
01:38:12,386 --> 01:38:16,932
<i>He was too confident in a body
that paraded its only weakness!</i>

960
01:38:20,227 --> 01:38:22,521
<i>Well, from my standpoint,</i>

961
01:38:22,563 --> 01:38:24,648
<i>it was an ending befitting of an artist.</i>

962
01:38:29,945 --> 01:38:31,572
Good work, Neji.

963
01:38:33,802 --> 01:38:37,639
You used those eyes to approach me
from my blind spot, huh...?

964
01:38:38,278 --> 01:38:40,864
It's the first time
I've seen the real deal...

965
01:38:42,222 --> 01:38:45,517
I'd like to see how it's different
from Itachi's Sharingan.

966
01:38:46,787 --> 01:38:49,664
But I think escaping from
this situation comes first now.

967
01:38:50,946 --> 01:38:55,534
Heh! Now that Team Guy,
the Leaf's mightiest team, is here...

968
01:38:56,263 --> 01:38:57,848
you can't escape!

969
01:39:00,031 --> 01:39:01,116
Exactly!

970
01:39:01,928 --> 01:39:03,180
Prepare yourself!

971
01:39:16,456 --> 01:39:17,457
<i>Team Guy, huh?</i>

972
01:39:31,725 --> 01:39:33,018
<i>Not bad.</i>

973
01:39:34,510 --> 01:39:37,096
<i>Severe Leaf Hurricane!</i>

974
01:39:39,348 --> 01:39:42,434
<i>Looks like it's impossible
to escape on foot...</i>

975
01:39:44,647 --> 01:39:45,648
Here I go!

976
01:39:51,276 --> 01:39:52,277
<i>8 Trigrams:</i>

977
01:39:56,161 --> 01:39:57,162
<i>Air Palm!</i>

978
01:40:16,885 --> 01:40:18,554
<i>These guys are so persistent!</i>

979
01:40:20,222 --> 01:40:21,932
<i>I'm sure it's around here...</i>

980
01:40:26,687 --> 01:40:27,813
<i>Down there, huh?!</i>

981
01:40:31,263 --> 01:40:32,264
He went down!

982
01:40:32,572 --> 01:40:34,574
We don't know what he's planning.

983
01:40:35,380 --> 01:40:36,381
Don't lower your guard!

984
01:40:36,596 --> 01:40:37,597
- Roger!
- Roger!

985
01:40:38,168 --> 01:40:39,169
Be careful, everyone!

986
01:40:39,621 --> 01:40:42,540
He's a long-range type
who uses explosives!

987
01:40:49,075 --> 01:40:51,912
I'll show you my ultimate work of art...

988
01:41:07,392 --> 01:41:10,437
<i>He's concentrating his chakra
in one spot all at once!</i>

989
01:41:10,804 --> 01:41:12,764
Get back quickly, everyone!

990
01:41:16,945 --> 01:41:19,239
<i>Art is an explosion!</i>

991
01:41:26,008 --> 01:41:27,051
We won't make it in time!

992
01:41:48,409 --> 01:41:49,410
What's going on?!

993
01:42:07,807 --> 01:42:09,136
<i>I somehow made it in time...</i>

994
01:42:18,423 --> 01:42:20,592
Are you okay, Kakashi-sensei?

995
01:42:21,677 --> 01:42:23,929
What in the world...
did you do?

996
01:42:27,970 --> 01:42:31,474
I blew the explosion...
into another dimension.

997
01:42:32,142 --> 01:42:34,978
<i>This is... a Sharingan visual jutsu...</i>

998
01:42:35,896 --> 01:42:37,981
I don't really get what happened,

999
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:41,738
but the enemy has
been defeated, right, Tenten?

1000
01:42:42,377 --> 01:42:45,714
Hey! Don't ask me that.

1001
01:42:47,244 --> 01:42:49,579
More importantly...
Is everyone okay?

1002
01:42:55,147 --> 01:42:56,231
Sakura...

1003
01:43:56,226 --> 01:44:01,064
Why...? Why did it have to be...?
Why is it always Gaara?

1004
01:44:02,005 --> 01:44:03,840
Did he have to die like this...?!

1005
01:44:08,432 --> 01:44:09,725
He's the Kazekage...

1006
01:44:11,319 --> 01:44:13,822
He just became the Kazekage...

1007
01:44:15,624 --> 01:44:18,897
Calm down, Naruto Uzumaki...

1008
01:44:19,396 --> 01:44:20,564
Shut up!

1009
01:44:24,549 --> 01:44:27,094
This wouldn't have happened

1010
01:44:27,253 --> 01:44:32,007
if you Sand shinobi hadn't put
a monster inside Gaara!

1011
01:44:32,728 --> 01:44:38,692
Did you even ask Gaara at all
about how he felt?!

1012
01:44:45,135 --> 01:44:46,845
Jinchuriki, my ass!

1013
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:52,335
You have no right to act so
high and mighty, labeling us...

1014
01:44:52,360 --> 01:44:54,153
with that word you created!

1015
01:45:19,271 --> 01:45:20,314
<i>Naruto...</i>

1016
01:45:22,183 --> 01:45:23,893
I can't save Sasuke...

1017
01:45:24,921 --> 01:45:27,215
And I can't save... Gaara...

1018
01:45:28,980 --> 01:45:31,191
I trained so hard for three years.

1019
01:45:32,503 --> 01:45:35,840
Nothing's changed
since three years ago...

1020
01:46:05,462 --> 01:46:08,131
Granny Chiyo...
That jutsu will...!

1021
01:46:14,451 --> 01:46:15,744
<i>Granny Chiyo...</i>

1022
01:46:32,378 --> 01:46:35,590
<i>This is what Granny Chiyo
was talking about...</i>

1023
01:46:36,431 --> 01:46:37,391
Is that...?

1024
01:46:38,517 --> 01:46:39,518
Yeah...

1025
01:46:39,851 --> 01:46:41,978
Hey, what are you doing?!

1026
01:46:46,691 --> 01:46:49,653
She's going to bring
Gaara back to life!

1027
01:46:58,161 --> 01:46:59,621
Bring him back to life...

1028
01:47:02,914 --> 01:47:06,334
Is such a thing...
really possible?

1029
01:47:08,922 --> 01:47:10,006
This jutsu...

1030
01:47:12,393 --> 01:47:16,064
is a special jutsu that
only Grandma Chiyo can perform...

1031
01:47:16,947 --> 01:47:18,282
Really?!

1032
01:47:18,598 --> 01:47:21,226
<i>There's no way that such
an extraordinary jutsu could exist...</i>

1033
01:47:23,979 --> 01:47:25,480
<i>That chakra flow...</i>

1034
01:47:27,186 --> 01:47:28,187
<i>No doubt...</i>

1035
01:47:29,091 --> 01:47:31,344
<i>It is accompanied by
a considerable risk...</i>

1036
01:47:40,935 --> 01:47:42,096
Damn...!

1037
01:47:45,959 --> 01:47:47,919
I don't have enough chakra...

1038
01:47:59,514 --> 01:48:02,934
You can use my chakra!

1039
01:48:04,057 --> 01:48:05,183
Would that be possible?

1040
01:48:05,793 --> 01:48:06,794
Granny...

1041
01:48:09,983 --> 01:48:13,820
Place your hand on top of mine.

1042
01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:40,931
<i>Naruto...</i>

1043
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:48,688
<i>Naruto has a mysterious power...</i>

1044
01:48:50,148 --> 01:48:54,194
<i>However small the words he exchanges,
he makes friends immediately...</i>

1045
01:48:54,236 --> 01:48:55,695
<i>with everyone he meets...</i>

1046
01:49:01,941 --> 01:49:07,780
Amidst this shinobi world created
by us foolish old people...

1047
01:49:08,429 --> 01:49:13,017
I am glad that a person
like you showed up...

1048
01:49:19,221 --> 01:49:24,813
The things I did in the past
were nothing but mistakes...

1049
01:49:25,835 --> 01:49:29,255
But now, at the very end,

1050
01:49:29,813 --> 01:49:33,316
it seems I can finally do something right.

1051
01:49:34,370 --> 01:49:37,957
The Sand... and the Leaf.

1052
01:49:43,535 --> 01:49:50,166
The future that's coming will surely
be different from the one in our time...

1053
01:49:54,659 --> 01:49:59,039
Your mysterious power
that Kakashi spoke of...

1054
01:49:59,507 --> 01:50:04,429
That power will surely
alter the future greatly...

1055
01:50:05,956 --> 01:50:09,918
when you become a Hokage
like none before...

1056
01:50:10,850 --> 01:50:12,602
And you, Sakura...!

1057
01:50:13,857 --> 01:50:14,858
Yes...

1058
01:50:14,883 --> 01:50:18,512
Next time, help the person
you cherish most...

1059
01:50:18,653 --> 01:50:23,533
not an old hag with
one foot in the grave...

1060
01:50:24,075 --> 01:50:27,203
You are very much like me...

1061
01:50:27,977 --> 01:50:33,315
There aren't many women
with your kind of spirit...

1062
01:50:34,544 --> 01:50:39,215
You will surely become
a Kunoichi who surpasses her master...

1063
01:50:43,710 --> 01:50:48,590
Naruto, this old lady has
a favor to ask you...

1064
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:53,313
You're the only one in this world

1065
01:50:53,367 --> 01:50:57,330
who truly understands Gaara's pain...

1066
01:50:58,394 --> 01:51:02,106
And Gaara...
He understands your pain, too...

1067
01:51:02,957 --> 01:51:07,628
Please... help Gaara...

1068
01:51:32,430 --> 01:51:33,431
<i>Gaara!</i>

1069
01:51:38,738 --> 01:51:40,322
<i>Gaara...!</i>

1070
01:51:45,281 --> 01:51:48,618
<i>Who are you... calling...?</i>

1071
01:51:51,162 --> 01:51:56,376
<i>Whose is it...? This hand...</i>

1072
01:51:59,629 --> 01:52:03,842
<i>Oh... It's just my hand again...</i>

1073
01:52:05,954 --> 01:52:07,872
<i>My hand...</i>

1074
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:11,641
<i>Me...?</i>

1075
01:52:14,227 --> 01:52:15,645
<i>Who am I...?</i>

1076
01:52:17,439 --> 01:52:18,440
<i>I...</i>

1077
01:52:22,444 --> 01:52:23,778
<i>I am...</i>

1078
01:52:30,577 --> 01:52:31,578
Gaara...

1079
01:52:39,039 --> 01:52:40,224
Naruto...

1080
01:52:59,314 --> 01:53:00,315
This is...

1081
01:53:02,025 --> 01:53:06,488
Everyone came running to help you.

1082
01:53:06,988 --> 01:53:07,989
Lord Gaara!

1083
01:53:08,698 --> 01:53:09,783
Are you all right?!

1084
01:53:17,248 --> 01:53:18,833
- Yes!
- Hurrah!

1085
01:53:24,380 --> 01:53:25,340
Thank heavens...

1086
01:53:25,365 --> 01:53:26,658
That's great!

1087
01:53:33,707 --> 01:53:35,292
Putting us to all this trouble!

1088
01:53:35,850 --> 01:53:36,935
Good grief.

1089
01:53:37,498 --> 01:53:40,001
You're such a pain, little brother,
making us worry.

1090
01:53:40,188 --> 01:53:42,690
What's with you guys...
acting arrogant like that?!

1091
01:53:43,191 --> 01:53:45,235
Gaara is the Kazekage, you know.

1092
01:53:46,925 --> 01:53:48,761
Don't be so disrespectful!

1093
01:53:48,951 --> 01:53:50,286
You're nothing but subordinates!

1094
01:53:52,409 --> 01:53:54,912
Gaara... How do you feel?

1095
01:54:04,085 --> 01:54:05,670
You shouldn't try to
get up so quickly.

1096
01:54:06,172 --> 01:54:09,175
Your body hasn't completely healed.

1097
01:54:13,807 --> 01:54:14,808
Thank heavens...!

1098
01:54:15,448 --> 01:54:18,451
I thought Lord Kazekage...
might really die...

1099
01:54:19,769 --> 01:54:22,897
There's no way that Lord Gaara
would die that easily!

1100
01:54:23,815 --> 01:54:28,027
Lord Gaara is reserved, cool,
strong, handsome, an elite, and...

1101
01:54:28,069 --> 01:54:31,281
Yes, yes, but he's still kind
of cute somehow...

1102
01:54:31,489 --> 01:54:33,283
And yet, he is the Kazekage...

1103
01:54:33,783 --> 01:54:37,495
This time, I'll show them for sure...
that I can protect Lord Gaara in a crisis!

1104
01:54:37,537 --> 01:54:38,538
No, I will!

1105
01:54:38,746 --> 01:54:39,747
I will!

1106
01:54:39,914 --> 01:54:40,874
Lord Gaara!

1107
01:54:40,874 --> 01:54:41,916
Out of the way, underling!

1108
01:54:45,164 --> 01:54:48,376
Come to think of it,
I am still a Genin.

1109
01:54:49,248 --> 01:54:50,458
Don't feel so depressed.

1110
01:54:52,533 --> 01:54:58,288
It's a well known fact that women
have a weakness for the cool, elite type.

1111
01:54:59,216 --> 01:55:03,386
I think Shikamaru was saying
something like that too...

1112
01:55:06,941 --> 01:55:09,235
Thank you... Naruto!

1113
01:55:12,196 --> 01:55:13,615
If you're going to say that,

1114
01:55:13,782 --> 01:55:15,909
you should be thanking
the old lady, not me...

1115
01:55:16,951 --> 01:55:20,371
She saved Gaara with
an incredible medical ninjutsu...

1116
01:55:21,372 --> 01:55:23,541
She got tired out,
so she's sleeping now, but...

1117
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,210
When the old lady gets back
to the village, she'll get well again...

1118
01:55:26,210 --> 01:55:27,503
No, you're wrong...

1119
01:55:38,832 --> 01:55:40,959
Granny Chiyo used that jutsu...

1120
01:55:42,432 --> 01:55:45,476
What do you mean I'm wrong?

1121
01:55:50,001 --> 01:55:51,002
I...

1122
01:55:54,030 --> 01:55:55,823
She wasn't just using medical ninjutsu...

1123
01:55:57,039 --> 01:55:58,373
She used a Reincarnation Jutsu.

1124
01:56:01,850 --> 01:56:03,435
Granny Chiyo is dead.

1125
01:56:08,294 --> 01:56:09,712
Reincarnation Jutsu?

1126
01:56:10,797 --> 01:56:13,841
Wh-What do you mean by that?

1127
01:56:14,842 --> 01:56:16,970
It's a ninjutsu that allows you

1128
01:56:17,222 --> 01:56:19,850
to bring a dead person back to life
in exchange for your own...

1129
01:56:21,599 --> 01:56:22,600
It can't be...!

1130
01:56:24,060 --> 01:56:25,061
<i>As I thought...</i>

1131
01:56:25,975 --> 01:56:26,976
Guy-sensei...

1132
01:56:34,091 --> 01:56:36,385
At one time, in the Sand Puppet Unit,

1133
01:56:37,528 --> 01:56:41,490
they were doing research to develop
a jutsu that could bring puppets to life.

1134
01:56:42,669 --> 01:56:44,537
Granny Chiyo headed up
the project...

1135
01:56:47,941 --> 01:56:50,026
They succeeded in developing
the jutsu in theory,

1136
01:56:50,837 --> 01:56:54,966
but midway, they decided
that the risks were too great.

1137
01:56:55,573 --> 01:56:57,575
Before it reached the stage
of human experiments,

1138
01:56:57,600 --> 01:56:59,936
it was designated a Forbidden Jutsu
and was sealed away.

1139
01:57:01,859 --> 01:57:06,155
<i>Your mysterious power
that Kakashi spoke of...</i>

1140
01:57:07,550 --> 01:57:11,638
<i>That power will surely
alter the future greatly...</i>

1141
01:57:15,945 --> 01:57:20,742
<i>when you become a Hokage
like none before...</i>

1142
01:57:30,606 --> 01:57:33,737
She looks as if she could start
laughing at any minute.

1143
01:57:33,762 --> 01:57:36,390
Her face looks so... peaceful...

1144
01:57:38,634 --> 01:57:39,635
Yes...

1145
01:57:42,305 --> 01:57:46,642
Naruto, you are a mysterious one,
after all.

1146
01:57:48,352 --> 01:57:51,314
You have the power to change people.

1147
01:57:54,814 --> 01:57:59,568
Granny Chiyo always used to say she
didn't care about the village's future...

1148
01:58:00,698 --> 01:58:04,869
She was not the kind of person
to do such a thing for Gaara.

1149
01:58:08,149 --> 01:58:12,278
Granny Chiyo entrusted the future
to Gaara and you...

1150
01:58:13,187 --> 01:58:16,399
Hers was a magnificent end,
befitting of a shinobi.

1151
01:58:20,728 --> 01:58:24,356
Yeah... just like Gramps, the Third.

1152
01:58:26,557 --> 01:58:27,558
You're right...

1153
01:58:29,560 --> 01:58:30,561
Yeah.

1154
01:58:31,771 --> 01:58:35,900
Now, I clearly understand
the old woman's wish.

1155
01:58:38,194 --> 01:58:39,195
Lord Gaara...!

1156
01:58:39,195 --> 01:58:40,196
It's okay...

1157
01:59:21,404 --> 01:59:26,576
Everyone, let us pray
for Granny Chiyo...

1158
01:59:51,100 --> 01:59:52,226
Granny Chiyo...

1159
02:00:34,769 --> 02:00:35,811
That's...

1160
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:56,707
Heh... what a lavish welcome.

1161
02:00:56,874 --> 02:00:58,209
Awesome...!

1162
02:00:58,542 --> 02:01:00,169
There are so many people...!

1163
02:01:00,836 --> 02:01:02,880
Just as would be expected
for the Kazekage...

1164
02:01:03,047 --> 02:01:04,048
Yeah...

1165
02:01:19,897 --> 02:01:21,107
I'm so glad you're safe...

1166
02:01:22,608 --> 02:01:24,026
It's thanks to everyone...

1167
02:01:25,078 --> 02:01:27,080
Naruto Uzumaki, I am truly grateful!

1168
02:01:27,405 --> 02:01:32,952
No, I...
I really wasn't able to do anything.

1169
02:01:37,576 --> 02:01:40,746
Lord Kazekage,
the villagers are waiting for you.

1170
02:01:45,309 --> 02:01:46,560
Right this way...

1171
02:02:06,613 --> 02:02:09,616
She said she didn't want
a grave.

1172
02:02:14,412 --> 02:02:17,999
But I thought it would
be better to have one.

1173
02:02:19,995 --> 02:02:24,291
I felt that everyone needed
a place to gather...

1174
02:02:26,464 --> 02:02:28,299
Everybody, say your farewells...

1175
02:02:28,787 --> 02:02:29,601
Okay.

1176
02:03:11,550 --> 02:03:12,551
Let's go.

1177
02:03:12,593 --> 02:03:13,594
Okay...

1178
02:03:48,963 --> 02:03:52,091
Sakura, Naruto... we should be going now.

1179
02:03:52,591 --> 02:03:53,592
Okay!

1180
02:03:53,676 --> 02:03:55,261
Let's go, Sakura.

1181
02:04:19,691 --> 02:04:22,027
<i>Granny Chiyo, thank you...</i>

1182
02:04:37,928 --> 02:04:38,762
See you...

1183
02:04:38,804 --> 02:04:40,055
Uh... yeah...

1184
02:04:45,940 --> 02:04:50,695
Normally, at time like this,
people shake hands and say goodbye...

1185
02:04:51,025 --> 02:04:54,862
but I'm not really good at that sort
of thing, so this will have to do...

1186
02:06:22,074 --> 02:06:24,118
Sensei! You guys are too slow!

1187
02:06:28,447 --> 02:06:31,283
Uh... I'm sorry, Guy.

1188
02:06:31,788 --> 02:06:34,166
When I use that new Sharingan,

1189
02:06:34,295 --> 02:06:36,463
it takes a toll on my body
for quite a while...

1190
02:06:37,204 --> 02:06:38,914
Hurry!

1191
02:06:47,351 --> 02:06:49,061
H-Hey...!

1192
02:06:49,935 --> 02:06:50,936
Huh?

1193
02:06:51,199 --> 02:06:52,200
What is it?

1194
02:07:00,380 --> 02:07:01,965
<i>That's... kinda disgusting...</i>

1195
02:07:02,597 --> 02:07:04,349
<i>Old men giving each other
a piggyback...</i>

1196
02:07:04,491 --> 02:07:06,118
<i>That's more sickening than I imagined.</i>

1197
02:07:06,412 --> 02:07:07,746
<i>Good grief... That's annoying...</i>

1198
02:07:12,913 --> 02:07:14,664
I see! It's training, isn't it!

1199
02:07:16,611 --> 02:07:18,947
Now this way, it'll be faster!

1200
02:07:21,578 --> 02:07:23,246
Move, move, move!

1201
02:07:28,057 --> 02:07:31,769
You guys...
You think you can keep up with me?!

1202
02:07:35,814 --> 02:07:38,567
<i>And adding movement to it
just makes it even more disgusting.</i>

1203
02:07:39,443 --> 02:07:41,028
- Neji...
- I refuse!

1204
02:07:51,424 --> 02:07:53,932
I've already pulled
some strings behind the scenes...

1205
02:07:53,957 --> 02:07:57,169
So that you'll be posted with
Kakashi's squad.

1206
02:07:58,288 --> 02:08:01,958
Not only are you close in age
with Naruto Uzumaki,

1207
02:08:02,107 --> 02:08:05,193
but you are also stronger than anyone
in the village of the same generation...

1208
02:08:05,511 --> 02:08:10,933
And above all else, I admire
your superb talent for painting...

1209
02:08:12,962 --> 02:08:15,881
From today until the completion
of this mission...

1210
02:08:16,083 --> 02:08:19,295
Your name is... Sai.

1211
02:08:20,373 --> 02:08:22,751
Sai. Right...

1212
02:08:28,121 --> 02:08:31,749
Don't put on a fake smile
like that in front of me.

1213
02:08:31,900 --> 02:08:32,901
I'm sorry...

1214
02:08:33,398 --> 02:08:36,207
It said in a book that
to get along with people,

1215
02:08:36,232 --> 02:08:37,643
you first have to be able to smile.

1216
02:08:38,877 --> 02:08:40,546
I've been practicing, but...

1217
02:08:41,422 --> 02:08:44,925
I still have difficulty in creating
facial expressions.

1218
02:10:33,450 --> 02:10:34,701
Gimme a break...

1219
02:10:34,827 --> 02:10:36,370
I wouldn't have thought that

1220
02:10:36,370 --> 02:10:38,121
my Self-Destructing Clone
would be warped away too...

1221
02:10:40,040 --> 02:10:43,056
What I lost was...
only up to about my elbow.

1222
02:10:43,915 --> 02:10:46,877
I must search for my right arm and ring...

1223
02:11:08,959 --> 02:11:11,503
<i>So this is Sasori's true form, huh...</i>

1224
02:11:12,840 --> 02:11:13,841
Here it is!

1225
02:11:15,953 --> 02:11:17,622
Zetsu, here it is!

1226
02:11:24,042 --> 02:11:27,518
I wonder if I can now become
a member of the Akatsuki...

1227
02:11:28,807 --> 02:11:31,217
One slot has opened up after all...

1228
02:11:33,260 --> 02:11:36,930
<i>You idiot... It's not that easy...</i>

1229
02:11:37,222 --> 02:11:39,558
Oh come on,
why don't you just let him join...

1230
02:11:40,392 --> 02:11:41,768
Tobi's a good boy...

1231
02:11:48,358 --> 02:11:49,443
<i>Let's go.</i>

1232
02:11:49,776 --> 02:11:52,237
Give me a second, Zetsu!

1233
02:11:53,280 --> 02:11:55,699
I'm sure...
It's around here somewhere.

1234
02:11:59,063 --> 02:12:01,113
Uh, hey, Zetsu!

1235
02:12:02,205 --> 02:12:05,292
Wait, please! Zetsu...
