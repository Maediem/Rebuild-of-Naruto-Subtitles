1
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,140
What did Lord Jiraiya say?

2
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,518
It seems the training
is going well.

3
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:24,858
The day that brat returns
may soon be upon us.

4
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,954
Naruto is a mysterious being...

5
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:42,625
He's been away from the village
for two whole years and yet...

6
00:00:58,316 --> 00:01:00,185
<i>Inuzuka Style:
Man Beast Transformation Combo!</i>

7
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:01,728
<i>Two-Headed Wolf!</i>

8
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:05,857
<i>Wolf Fang Over Fang!</i>

9
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:13,323
... his presence keeps on growing.

10
00:01:20,545 --> 00:01:21,546
Are you all right?

11
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,752
I'm at my limit!

12
00:01:25,777 --> 00:01:27,278
Just ten more laps!

13
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,757
If you stop now,
Naruto will laugh at you!

14
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:36,888
Everyone seems to keep Naruto
in their thoughts as they train!

15
00:01:53,884 --> 00:01:55,010
A messenger hawk!

16
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,911
Where?!

17
00:02:02,452 --> 00:02:03,373
Lord Kazekage!

18
00:02:03,926 --> 00:02:06,643
A messenger hawk has arrived
with a message

19
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,670
from the Hidden Leaf's Fifth Hokage.

20
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:21,762
I was getting tired of waiting.

21
00:02:22,514 --> 00:02:24,391
You're our welcoming party?

22
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,854
Thank you for coming to meet us.

23
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:30,360
Well, it's a drag,
but seeing as it's Lord Kazekage...

24
00:02:31,975 --> 00:02:33,018
Welcome.

25
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,205
This is the data from
the Chunin Exam two years ago.

26
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:50,578
A total of 153 entrants.

27
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,047
Information about the entrant's village,

28
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,675
the three tests for this exam,
and the qualifying statistics

29
00:02:55,756 --> 00:02:57,716
are compiled in an easy-to-read format.

30
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,972
But you would know more
about the reason behind

31
00:03:00,997 --> 00:03:03,166
the interruption of the final test
and its chronology.

32
00:03:04,813 --> 00:03:07,816
Due to the suspension
of the last Chunin Exam,

33
00:03:08,164 --> 00:03:12,275
the Hidden Leaf would like to
co-host a Chunin Exam.

34
00:03:12,781 --> 00:03:14,742
Thanks in part to
the Hidden Leaf's cooperation,

35
00:03:14,812 --> 00:03:16,874
the situation in
our village has stabilized

36
00:03:16,899 --> 00:03:17,942
during the last two years...

37
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,293
In particular,

38
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:22,373
our training curriculum
has been very successful

39
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:24,251
and we have developed more Genin

40
00:03:24,276 --> 00:03:25,943
who are qualified to take the Chunin Exam.

41
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:29,334
Then you have no objection
to our sponsoring an event?

42
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:33,213
Before that, Lady Hokage...
What's your true motive?

43
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,550
"True motive?"

44
00:03:39,524 --> 00:03:42,736
I mean the timing of this thing.
Why hold the Chunin Exam now?

45
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,016
If the reason is lack of personnel...

46
00:03:45,211 --> 00:03:47,630
you could have done this sooner.

47
00:03:49,713 --> 00:03:50,714
All right.

48
00:03:50,935 --> 00:03:52,395
I'll be honest.

49
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:57,521
The first reason is to gauge
the reactions of

50
00:03:57,692 --> 00:04:00,361
each of the villages
within the Five Great Nations.

51
00:04:00,848 --> 00:04:03,851
All of whom, on the surface,
claim to be at peace.

52
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,799
Their response to having
the combined Chunin Exam

53
00:04:07,935 --> 00:04:10,021
will reveal their true feelings.

54
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:13,828
The second reason is to
investigate Akatsuki's movements.

55
00:04:14,868 --> 00:04:18,163
It's said that they seek
the Tailed Beasts from each village,

56
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:21,386
but they've been awfully quiet
these past two years.

57
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:25,306
You want to use the Chunin Exam
to open the village

58
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:29,435
to create an opportunity
to lure the Akatsuki out?

59
00:04:29,795 --> 00:04:33,298
Yes. The Akatsuki have
probably grown impatient

60
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,900
and are ready to make a move.

61
00:04:43,098 --> 00:04:44,725
This is a risky—

62
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,751
Hold on.

63
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,209
This Chunin Exam...

64
00:04:51,405 --> 00:04:53,824
The Hidden Sand
would like to host it,

65
00:04:53,901 --> 00:04:55,986
to coincide with
my inauguration as Kazekage.

66
00:04:59,493 --> 00:05:00,744
That will not do.

67
00:05:00,921 --> 00:05:05,258
The Hidden Leaf must
host this Chunin Exam.

68
00:05:05,511 --> 00:05:08,264
It's so that we may finish
what we started previously.

69
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,897
Yes, absolutely.

70
00:05:11,898 --> 00:05:15,276
The Kazekage can't
decide this all by himself.

71
00:05:15,301 --> 00:05:17,387
He must consult the village elders.

72
00:05:18,249 --> 00:05:21,294
Yeah. We need time to contact them.

73
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,641
Let's come back to this again
at the next meeting.

74
00:05:28,311 --> 00:05:29,812
Fine.

75
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:33,801
We'll settle this during
the next meeting.

76
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:44,068
This is becoming a drag.

77
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:48,757
Yeah. I didn't expect Gaara
to make such an announcement.

78
00:05:49,385 --> 00:05:51,637
He really didn't tell you anything?

79
00:05:51,891 --> 00:05:53,392
That came out of nowhere.

80
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,899
Well, he probably
has his own ideas.

81
00:06:06,903 --> 00:06:07,946
I leave it to you.

82
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,497
If the Hokage is right
and the Akatsuki make their move,

83
00:06:12,522 --> 00:06:14,565
you're going to be
their target, right?

84
00:06:15,192 --> 00:06:16,860
If the enemy wants
the Tailed Beasts,

85
00:06:16,991 --> 00:06:19,243
they'll come for me
sooner or later.

86
00:06:19,681 --> 00:06:22,559
Then I'll just be the bait
and take them down.

87
00:06:22,859 --> 00:06:23,965
What are you saying?!

88
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:27,136
The village has welcomed you
as their new Kazekage

89
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,305
but things are still unstable!

90
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,539
I'm aware of that.

91
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:38,022
I know that some are not happy
that I have become the Kazekage...

92
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:42,677
and would welcome
an opportunity to kill me.

93
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:45,351
Then why would you even consider
hosting the event in our village?!

94
00:06:45,376 --> 00:06:46,627
It is precisely why I want

95
00:06:46,703 --> 00:06:49,122
the Chunin Exam in the
Hidden Sand Village.

96
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:51,644
You can't be serious!

97
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:55,123
It's not the Akatsuki
you want to lure out...

98
00:06:55,612 --> 00:06:57,364
But the rebels in the village?

99
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,170
That's just too dangerous.

100
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:18,429
Regarding the combined
Chunin Exam under discussion...

101
00:07:18,782 --> 00:07:19,950
It is Lord Kazekage's desire

102
00:07:19,975 --> 00:07:23,020
to host this event in
the Hidden Sand Village.

103
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,197
He intends to introduce himself
to the other nations.

104
00:07:28,444 --> 00:07:29,949
Is that wise?

105
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:32,828
While things have been quiet
for a while now,

106
00:07:33,136 --> 00:07:34,846
it does not change
the fact that Gaara is

107
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,956
"a military weapon to be feared."

108
00:07:37,513 --> 00:07:39,098
As long as Gaara lives,

109
00:07:39,294 --> 00:07:42,506
this village can never
be truly at peace.

110
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,593
For the second test of this exam,
Lord Gaara intends to

111
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:53,055
suggest the Demon Desert
as a suitable arena.

112
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:58,060
And we, the Hidden Sand,
will do our utmost to support him!

113
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,821
Yura is on to us.

114
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:12,700
No... everyone is
uneasy about Gaara.

115
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:16,461
But that's not enough
to plan a coup d'état.

116
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:19,383
Well, well... my elders...

117
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,251
Of all places to find you.

118
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,295
What do you want?

119
00:08:24,674 --> 00:08:28,187
We said we are in favor
of Lord Gaara's plan.

120
00:08:28,457 --> 00:08:30,918
Nothing, I just forgot to tell you...

121
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:36,599
Lord Gaara plans to
personally supervise the test site.

122
00:08:37,805 --> 00:08:40,012
We'll have to be very careful
with preparations.

123
00:08:40,404 --> 00:08:43,653
After all, the second test
is a survival test

124
00:08:43,678 --> 00:08:45,346
and there are always fatalities.

125
00:08:47,254 --> 00:08:50,133
Why who's to say
nothing will happen

126
00:08:50,158 --> 00:08:53,578
to the supervisor himself,
Lord Gaara...

127
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,537
Excuse me...

128
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,044
So this is the perfect opportunity
to get rid of the Kazekage

129
00:09:05,069 --> 00:09:07,197
and make it look purely accidental...

130
00:09:08,087 --> 00:09:10,089
But he is a Jinchuriki.

131
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:11,609
There's a way.

132
00:09:12,494 --> 00:09:15,089
The first Jinchuriki, Bunpuku,

133
00:09:15,114 --> 00:09:17,932
was able to temporarily seal
Shukaku into a teapot.

134
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,016
We can use that...

135
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,480
What is your decision,
Lady Tsunade?

136
00:09:28,288 --> 00:09:32,459
Two years ago, Jiraiya had intel
that said the Akatsuki would

137
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,533
target Naruto
in three or four years.

138
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,971
And two years have passed...

139
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:42,719
I'm sure they're itching
to make a move.

140
00:09:42,744 --> 00:09:45,330
You're not going to use Naruto
as bait, are you?

141
00:09:45,355 --> 00:09:46,023
No...

142
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,213
As the Hokage of the
Hidden Leaf Village.

143
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,715
I cannot do such a thing.

144
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:55,646
Don't tell me... the Kazekage
will assume that role?

145
00:09:57,198 --> 00:09:59,992
As luck would have it,
he was the one who proposed it.

146
00:10:00,068 --> 00:10:03,018
But will the advisors agree?

147
00:10:03,615 --> 00:10:06,899
I'll placate them
by suggesting a joint-sponsorship.

148
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,317
We can't negotiate any further.

149
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:15,740
I looked over the plans
you submitted...

150
00:10:18,937 --> 00:10:20,188
What do you think about

151
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:23,630
a joint-sponsorship with the Hidden Leaf?

152
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:26,087
We'll hold the first test,
the written one,

153
00:10:26,112 --> 00:10:27,447
at the Hidden Leaf...

154
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:30,424
And the Hidden Sand

155
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:33,285
will host the site of
the second test, the survival one.

156
00:10:37,225 --> 00:10:41,061
The Forest of Death has
become too familiar as a test site.

157
00:10:41,698 --> 00:10:45,077
I was just thinking a new site
would be necessary.

158
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,730
Hmm... I agree.

159
00:10:53,704 --> 00:10:55,831
We have no objections.

160
00:11:00,565 --> 00:11:01,608
All right then...

161
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,057
We'll meet again at the Chunin Exam.

162
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,501
Yeah...

163
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,533
Come to us if any trouble arises.

164
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,336
We'll take care of it, crybaby.

165
00:11:17,172 --> 00:11:19,675
Damn it. She doesn't change.

166
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:26,487
The Hidden Sound probably
won't take part this time around...

167
00:11:26,946 --> 00:11:29,555
So should we just send invitations

168
00:11:29,635 --> 00:11:31,342
to everyone else
from the last time?

169
00:11:31,632 --> 00:11:33,676
Yes. In addition,
send invitations for

170
00:11:33,912 --> 00:11:36,248
the introduction of
the new Kazekage

171
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,001
to every village within
the Five Great Nations.

172
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:40,950
I see...

173
00:11:41,354 --> 00:11:43,231
Then we can monitor
each village's response.

174
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:47,396
Aside from Akatsuki,
this is the other reason

175
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,251
for reopening the combined Chunin Exam.

176
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:52,478
Yes, I understand.

177
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,711
Deliver this to every village.

178
00:12:07,988 --> 00:12:09,988
It's the invitation to the Chunin Exam.

179
00:12:10,467 --> 00:12:11,225
– Right!
– Right!

180
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,074
We've put out the bait...

181
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:27,037
Now, let's see how they react.

182
00:12:51,092 --> 00:12:52,021
Lady Tsunade.

183
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,733
The Hidden Sand replied right away...

184
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:58,277
Oh...

185
00:12:58,928 --> 00:13:02,239
They'll be sending nine teams...
27 Genin.

186
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:05,257
Last time,
they sent 30 in ten teams...

187
00:13:05,972 --> 00:13:07,765
Although that's one team short,

188
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,623
considering the Hidden Sand's
current situation,

189
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:13,209
one has to commend them
for nurturing this many Genin.

190
00:13:13,384 --> 00:13:14,293
Yes...

191
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,798
Any word from the other villages?

192
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,424
No, not yet.

193
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:23,881
How will the other Kage respond?

194
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:29,042
A Chunin Exam, you say?!

195
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,536
Damn that Princess Tsunade!

196
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,188
She's getting carried away!

197
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:37,441
She probably coaxed
the Kazekage into cooperating...

198
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,900
... and plans to get the jump on us
within the Five Great Nations.

199
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:42,730
What will you do?

200
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:43,939
Ignore her!

201
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:45,575
Just ignore her!

202
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:49,331
Do not mention a word of this,
or the past, to anyone!

203
00:13:49,874 --> 00:13:52,042
Especially Bee!
Do not let him find out!

204
00:13:52,823 --> 00:13:54,825
Whenever there
are events like this,

205
00:13:55,238 --> 00:13:58,796
he gets excited about live concerts
and what not.

206
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,923
Actually, I already told him.

207
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:02,958
What?!

208
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,387
He kept asking questions...
I'm sorry.

209
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,390
Bee!

210
00:14:09,564 --> 00:14:10,732
Where is Bee?!

211
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:12,976
Don't tell me...

212
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,522
Find Bee immediately
and bring him here!

213
00:14:17,376 --> 00:14:18,377
Understood.

214
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,484
This is so dull...

215
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,364
A concert at Hidden Leaf Village...

216
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,284
Tuning up at the Chunin Exam...

217
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:32,618
Take a lesson from Kin-chan-sensei!

218
00:14:32,643 --> 00:14:33,408
Yay!

219
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,585
Bee! Lord Raikage wants to see you!

220
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:38,836
Please return!

221
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:40,963
Fool, ya fool!

222
00:14:45,265 --> 00:14:46,925
What did Lord Raikage say?

223
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:51,098
Unfortunately, they are swamped
with village business
bv
224
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:53,488
and don't have enough
time to prepare.

225
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,735
Now why would the Hokage
and Kazekage send a letter?

226
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:08,588
Seems they're resuming
the Chunin Exam...

227
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,920
What shall we do?

228
00:15:13,236 --> 00:15:15,497
We must consider the matter
with the Fourth, Yagura...

229
00:15:15,522 --> 00:15:18,509
I believe we should concentrate
on rebuilding the village...

230
00:15:19,698 --> 00:15:22,075
You may have a point.

231
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,101
Yes!

232
00:15:23,611 --> 00:15:25,382
We can't be wasting
our time participating

233
00:15:25,407 --> 00:15:27,117
in a ceremony announcing
the new Kazekage...

234
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,470
<i>Ceremony...</i>

235
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:32,831
<i>Can't waste time for
a ceremony for me?</i>

236
00:15:36,308 --> 00:15:37,935
Shut up or I'll kill you.

237
00:15:38,383 --> 00:15:39,384
What?!

238
00:15:40,737 --> 00:15:46,167
Perhaps we should forego
the Chunin Exam this time.

239
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,656
Let's do that.

240
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,370
It seems the Hidden Mist
are tied up as well.

241
00:16:01,746 --> 00:16:04,582
The Hidden Leaf has
delivered an invitation

242
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:08,069
to the combined Chunin Exam!

243
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:12,105
Their ulterior motive
is crystal clear!

244
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:15,199
They want to test
the strength of the villages

245
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:18,613
and prepare for the next battle!

246
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,082
Just throw it back in their face!

247
00:16:22,831 --> 00:16:24,249
I intend to do so!

248
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,589
This is what I'll do
to their invitation!

249
00:16:53,264 --> 00:16:55,100
I want you to go here.

250
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,334
To the Hidden Rain Village?

251
00:16:58,803 --> 00:17:01,395
Yes, the most troublesome spot.

252
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:08,019
As expected, every person
who enters is investigated,

253
00:17:08,692 --> 00:17:11,588
and they're kept under strict
surveillance during their stay.

254
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:14,283
Hanzo of the Salamander rules it...

255
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:16,379
Yes, so I've heard.

256
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,336
Even if I'm carrying an invitation
to the combined Chunin Exam,

257
00:17:20,432 --> 00:17:22,322
I doubt if they'll
let me in easily.

258
00:17:23,122 --> 00:17:27,062
There's domestic instability
and even rumors of a coup d'état.

259
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:30,257
It's so closed off, no one knows
the true state of things.

260
00:17:30,872 --> 00:17:34,250
While I'm at it, shall I look into
their internal affairs then?

261
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:37,688
Yes, but don't take any chances.

262
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,368
Halt!

263
00:18:03,281 --> 00:18:04,811
Are you a shinobi
of the Hidden Leaf?

264
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:09,296
Yes, I'm Kakashi Hatake
of the Hidden Leaf Village.

265
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,024
Our Lady Hokage sent me here.

266
00:18:12,972 --> 00:18:17,559
I have a joint letter from the Hidden Leaf
and the Hidden Sand.

267
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,218
Then I will accept it.

268
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:23,018
No... I've been ordered to
present it to your leader,

269
00:18:23,292 --> 00:18:25,389
Hanzo of the Salamander himself.

270
00:18:26,412 --> 00:18:29,566
Is that a part of your plan
to get close to Lord Hanzo?!

271
00:18:31,553 --> 00:18:36,850
Threatening me is the same as threatening
the Hidden Leaf and the Hidden Sand...

272
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:38,742
Is that what you really want?

273
00:18:42,879 --> 00:18:43,880
All right...

274
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,111
I'll let them know.

275
00:18:54,623 --> 00:18:56,084
Lord Hanzo will see you now.

276
00:18:56,644 --> 00:18:58,944
Surrender all of your weapons,
and then enter.

277
00:19:00,252 --> 00:19:03,588
<i>As rumored, the immigration inspections
are extremely strict.</i>

278
00:19:11,996 --> 00:19:14,290
<i>So his security is airtight.</i>

279
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,151
Kakashi Hatake...

280
00:19:16,224 --> 00:19:17,428
Nice of you to come.

281
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,253
Put the message you brought
over there.

282
00:19:48,768 --> 00:19:52,063
A letter has arrived from Hanzo of
the Salamander

283
00:19:52,088 --> 00:19:53,506
from the Hidden Rain Village.

284
00:19:58,812 --> 00:20:04,885
Oh! He's sending Genin to join
the Hidden Leaf and the Hidden Sand...

285
00:20:05,858 --> 00:20:10,654
Does this repudiate the rumors
surrounding the Hidden Rain then?

286
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:11,793
No...

287
00:20:12,237 --> 00:20:18,966
Sending Genin could simply be
a ruse to hide the truth...

288
00:20:19,546 --> 00:20:20,385
Then...

289
00:20:21,501 --> 00:20:26,861
Keep a close watch on the
Hidden Rain Genin who are sent here.

290
00:20:49,321 --> 00:20:51,991
I am so bored...

291
00:20:59,185 --> 00:21:01,569
Fuu! Lord Shibuki wants to see you.

292
00:21:03,567 --> 00:21:06,278
Oh no! Did I do something?

293
00:21:15,661 --> 00:21:17,953
Lord Shibuki, I've brought Fuu.

294
00:21:18,813 --> 00:21:20,075
Hey, Fuu!

295
00:21:22,387 --> 00:21:24,887
What's up, Chief?!

296
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:26,368
What were you thinking?!

297
00:21:26,905 --> 00:21:28,990
Requesting an application for
the Chunin Exam

298
00:21:29,015 --> 00:21:30,558
from the Hidden Leaf?!

299
00:21:31,032 --> 00:21:32,161
Shouldn't I have?

300
00:21:32,327 --> 00:21:35,147
Then can you recommend me?

301
00:21:35,557 --> 00:21:36,489
What?!

302
00:21:37,063 --> 00:21:39,774
And what will you do if it leaks out
that you're a Jinchuriki?

303
00:21:41,531 --> 00:21:43,533
Well then...
I guess I'll go on my own.

304
00:21:43,966 --> 00:21:44,678
Huh?!

305
00:21:45,098 --> 00:21:46,600
H-Hey wait!

306
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:47,848
Wait, Fuu!

307
00:21:49,203 --> 00:21:51,789
I want to see the outside world!

308
00:21:52,164 --> 00:21:55,114
If you won't acknowledge me,
I'll just leave the village!

309
00:21:55,579 --> 00:21:56,941
A-All right!

310
00:21:59,141 --> 00:22:01,936
You never give up once
you make up your mind.

311
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,530
Will you forgive me?

312
00:22:05,047 --> 00:22:06,870
Then listen to me.

313
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:14,166
The Chunin Exam isn't
your run-of-the-mill test.

314
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,710
It's a battle where you
put your life on the line

315
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,754
for your dreams and
the pride of the village.

316
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,565
In the past, the Hidden Waterfall Village

317
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:25,052
was nowhere near the scale of
the Hidden Leaf or the Hidden Sand,

318
00:22:25,284 --> 00:22:26,379
but we were feared

319
00:22:26,404 --> 00:22:29,615
as a shinobi village that produced
skilled Jonin, one after another.

320
00:22:31,219 --> 00:22:34,681
That's why, although we are
not part of the Five Great Nations,

321
00:22:34,705 --> 00:22:36,249
we are allotted a Tailed Beast.

322
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,233
The Chunin Exam is the ideal opportunity
to make a name for us

323
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,402
and impress the Feudal Lords
who hire shinobi villages,

324
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:43,779
and other shinobi leaders as well.

325
00:22:45,754 --> 00:22:48,796
It's our chance to restore
our past glory.

326
00:22:49,774 --> 00:22:51,234
As long as you're going
to participate,

327
00:22:51,259 --> 00:22:53,887
go out and fight to make
the Hidden Waterfall Village known.

328
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,618
All right! Got it!

329
00:22:57,643 --> 00:22:59,478
I'll rile up a storm!

330
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:00,379
However!

331
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,255
Don't let anyone find out...

332
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,007
... that you are a Jinchuriki...

333
00:23:04,997 --> 00:23:06,212
Okay!

334
00:23:09,284 --> 00:23:10,558
Kegon, Yoro...

335
00:23:11,121 --> 00:23:13,617
Hide your Jonin status
and guard Fuu.

336
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:14,643
– Right!
– Right!

337
00:23:17,967 --> 00:23:19,773
She's beyond my control now.

338
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:22,592
Does this mean...

339
00:23:23,122 --> 00:23:27,793
the Hidden Waterfall Village will
send one team of three?

340
00:23:28,228 --> 00:23:30,856
It's almost terrifying
in its brevity,

341
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:34,105
but it is an official application.

342
00:23:34,845 --> 00:23:37,712
Let's close
the application period soon!

343
00:23:38,158 --> 00:23:38,787
Oh!

344
00:23:38,812 --> 00:23:39,752
What is it?

345
00:23:39,777 --> 00:23:43,739
W-We forgot to call for entrants
from the Hidden Leaf!

346
00:23:44,046 --> 00:23:45,172
What?!

347
00:23:52,103 --> 00:23:54,221
Are you actually going
to supervise?

348
00:23:55,363 --> 00:23:59,576
Yes. I'll oversee the finals
of the second test.

349
00:24:00,266 --> 00:24:02,393
It's so that no fatalities
occur during the test.

350
00:24:02,965 --> 00:24:05,217
What will you achieve
by smoking out the rebels?

351
00:24:05,627 --> 00:24:06,628
It's not like that...

352
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:07,888
Then what?

353
00:24:08,433 --> 00:24:10,435
Why would you go so far
as to face danger head on?

354
00:24:12,305 --> 00:24:15,891
My feelings haven't changed
from that time.

355
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,749
Don't tell me...
you want to bond with the rebels?

356
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:21,937
That's impossible!

357
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:26,014
Even if you're up to it,
they won't listen!

358
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,621
He is...

359
00:24:28,003 --> 00:24:31,424
Naruto is working hard,
to forge bonds with others...

360
00:24:32,877 --> 00:24:35,004
So I won't give up either
until the day comes

361
00:24:35,405 --> 00:24:39,910
when I can share suffering,
sadness, and happiness with others.

362
00:24:40,582 --> 00:24:42,543
I consider this my first test,

363
00:24:42,568 --> 00:24:44,904
as the Kazekage of the Hidden Sand Village.

364
00:24:46,639 --> 00:24:50,233
<i>Once he makes up his mind,
he won't listen... Damn it!</i>

365
00:24:52,873 --> 00:24:55,494
The Hidden Sand will send
the same as last time...

366
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,120
Nine teams, 27 shinobi.

367
00:24:57,716 --> 00:24:59,551
The Hidden Rain will have fifteen.

368
00:24:59,934 --> 00:25:01,686
And the Hidden Grass is sending six.

369
00:25:02,268 --> 00:25:04,562
The Hidden Waterfall sent word

370
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:06,932
that they are also sending
a team of three.

371
00:25:08,421 --> 00:25:12,466
The Hidden Cloud and the Hidden Mist
sent polite regrets,

372
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,515
but our invitation was sent back
by the Hidden Stone.

373
00:25:17,292 --> 00:25:19,502
As the host village,

374
00:25:19,605 --> 00:25:22,334
we'll have to enter the same number
as the last exam.

375
00:25:25,661 --> 00:25:28,443
I want all of you to list
the Genin under you

376
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,111
and turn in your recommendations.

377
00:25:47,417 --> 00:25:48,793
Are you stupid?

378
00:25:49,003 --> 00:25:50,215
That's barely cooked.

379
00:25:51,037 --> 00:25:54,678
Meat tastes best when
there's still some red left.

380
00:25:56,697 --> 00:25:58,073
Hey, Asuma-sensei...

381
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,268
So what's going to happen
to our team

382
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:02,852
in the upcoming Chunin Exam?

383
00:26:03,598 --> 00:26:07,936
Considering your skills now,
it's only natural I recommend you.

384
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:12,571
But Shikamaru is already
a Chunin, so he can't enter.

385
00:26:14,894 --> 00:26:17,688
So we're one member short.

386
00:26:17,967 --> 00:26:22,180
Currently, Team Asuma is
captained by Shikamaru.

387
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:25,417
If I'm to find a replacement...

388
00:26:26,343 --> 00:26:27,644
It's going to be difficult

389
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,380
to be a stand-in just for the Chunin Exam.

390
00:26:30,674 --> 00:26:34,219
Umm... I have someone in mind.

391
00:26:36,064 --> 00:26:39,686
Someone who rivals Shikamaru
in intelligence?

392
00:26:42,925 --> 00:26:44,551
Is there anyone like that?

393
00:26:44,889 --> 00:26:47,267
She's probably not
as smart as Shikamaru,

394
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:50,008
but she may just
be tougher than him.

395
00:26:56,355 --> 00:26:57,604
You'll be fine now.

396
00:27:07,427 --> 00:27:09,596
Me? Join Team Asuma?

397
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:14,257
Both Sasuke and Naruto
are missing from Team 7, right?

398
00:27:14,749 --> 00:27:16,417
Y-Yeah...

399
00:27:17,516 --> 00:27:19,392
So you need to join a three-man team

400
00:27:19,417 --> 00:27:22,128
in order to take the Chunin Exam, right?!

401
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:24,292
Yeah...

402
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:27,437
So you'll join, right?

403
00:27:28,323 --> 00:27:29,324
But...

404
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:32,734
I know your strength
better than anyone.

405
00:27:34,682 --> 00:27:36,768
At the last Chunin Exam...

406
00:27:36,901 --> 00:27:38,987
I got a good taste of your power.

407
00:27:43,952 --> 00:27:48,164
Still... I can't.
Please find someone else.

408
00:27:48,351 --> 00:27:49,519
Why?!

409
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:54,673
We know that you've trained hard
under Lady Tsunade for two years.

410
00:27:55,117 --> 00:27:56,888
You've grown so much.

411
00:28:00,354 --> 00:28:03,148
If you're just going to wait
for Naruto and Sasuke...

412
00:28:03,361 --> 00:28:04,557
If you do that,

413
00:28:04,714 --> 00:28:06,835
you'll never be able to seize the
opportunities that come your way!

414
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,240
It's not that...

415
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:13,915
If you add me to your team now,
I'll probably be a nuisance.

416
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,109
That's not true! Please!

417
00:28:19,209 --> 00:28:21,032
You're going to take the Chunin Exam?

418
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,941
Are you serious?

419
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:24,954
Please...

420
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:27,414
I already told you I can't authorize it.

421
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,210
The seal for the chakra
of the 100 Healings Jutsu...

422
00:28:30,364 --> 00:28:32,825
and the reservoir for the chakra
I normally use...

423
00:28:33,453 --> 00:28:36,123
I was able to control
both of these reserves

424
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:38,091
and successfully performed surgery.

425
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:41,594
I want to see how far I can go.

426
00:28:42,301 --> 00:28:45,596
I want to push myself as far as I can
by participating in this exam.

427
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:49,436
I'm still a novice...

428
00:28:49,651 --> 00:28:53,755
yet Choji and Ino asked me
to join them.

429
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,192
They asked me to take
the Chunin Exam with them.

430
00:28:56,908 --> 00:28:59,911
I want to honor their trust in me!

431
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:01,865
Please!

432
00:29:10,021 --> 00:29:11,022
Take this with you.

433
00:29:16,202 --> 00:29:17,328
Thank you very much!

434
00:29:17,644 --> 00:29:18,495
However...

435
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,689
Whatever happens at the Chunin Exam
will be your sole responsibility.

436
00:29:22,044 --> 00:29:22,661
Understood?

437
00:29:23,558 --> 00:29:24,253
Yes!

438
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,384
Okay, with the team of
Ino, Choji and Sakura...

439
00:29:29,622 --> 00:29:31,707
our participant list is complete.

440
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:35,315
It's not as many as the 29 teams
we had the last time...

441
00:29:35,548 --> 00:29:37,591
But it's a decent list of participants.

442
00:29:37,865 --> 00:29:38,525
Yes.

443
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,654
The time has finally come.

444
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:13,269
Big Brother Shikamaru,
what's going on?

445
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:14,896
Hmm?

446
00:30:15,239 --> 00:30:17,999
The first test of the Chunin Exam
will be held here,

447
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,901
so we're just making a few upgrades.

448
00:30:20,327 --> 00:30:21,778
The Chunin Exam!

449
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:24,168
It's been a while since they last held one!

450
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,199
It's been two years...

451
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,952
That means we get to participate!

452
00:30:28,991 --> 00:30:31,786
We can be Chunin!

453
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,095
You guys are
still Academy students.

454
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,713
You're not even Genin,
you can't participate.

455
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:41,589
That's kind of a disappointment,
but also a big relief...

456
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,302
I see, so this means
Big Brother Naruto's coming back!

457
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,304
Huh? Naruto?

458
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,598
He's coming back to take
the Chunin Exam, right?

459
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:51,891
He's not coming.

460
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:52,767
What?

461
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,657
Who knows where or how
he's training right now.

462
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,482
His whereabouts are still unknown.

463
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,252
I don't know if he even got the news

464
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,476
that we're holding the Chunin Exam.

465
00:31:05,921 --> 00:31:07,089
Does this mean
they're going to proceed

466
00:31:07,114 --> 00:31:08,448
without Big Brother Naruto?

467
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:12,837
It's not like the village can plan
things to fit his schedule.

468
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:18,251
Big Bro's going to be left behind.

469
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,254
Our leader's going to
get disqualified!

470
00:31:38,133 --> 00:31:41,777
We're representing the Hidden Sand,
so we have to make Chunin!

471
00:31:42,371 --> 00:31:44,499
It's too soon to get
all worked up.

472
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,696
Calm down, Yukata.

473
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:56,142
Seems like Shikamaru
will be a proctor.

474
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,101
That's not surprising.

475
00:31:58,672 --> 00:32:01,508
It's because he's already a Chunin.

476
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:06,716
Then let's buckle down and
get promoted to Chunin too! Right?

477
00:32:13,657 --> 00:32:14,699
Looking forward to
doing this with you!

478
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,309
- Let's kick some ass.
- Yeah!

479
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,772
All right, so the three of you
are taking this exam, correct?

480
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,315
You've been signed up.

481
00:32:22,666 --> 00:32:23,750
There's no trick this time,

482
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,653
like not letting us submit
our applications, is there?

483
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,073
This test is up to
the proctor in charge.

484
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,368
Okay, draw lots.

485
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:39,749
Three?

486
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,167
Two?

487
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:42,710
One?

488
00:32:43,296 --> 00:32:47,258
Return the lots and please proceed
to the classroom that you picked.

489
00:32:48,275 --> 00:32:50,652
They're so polite,
it's almost creepy.

490
00:32:50,856 --> 00:32:52,250
Did Shikamaru plan this?

491
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,597
What is he thinking?

492
00:32:55,399 --> 00:32:56,918
Next, please.

493
00:33:03,193 --> 00:33:05,153
You're the entrants from
the Hidden Waterfall Village.

494
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:06,610
The name's Fuu.

495
00:33:06,635 --> 00:33:08,262
All right, please draw a lot.

496
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,865
We've waited so long for this,

497
00:33:12,975 --> 00:33:14,560
so we have to make it
and become Chunin!

498
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,448
You're so loud!

499
00:33:19,604 --> 00:33:22,190
Is this where the Chunin Exam
is being held?!

500
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,798
Hey! I'm back.

501
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,111
Naruto!

502
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:35,092
No way...
Is that you, Naruto?!

503
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,806
Are you real?

504
00:33:36,831 --> 00:33:38,313
I'm real!

505
00:33:38,506 --> 00:33:40,674
You really haven't changed much.

506
00:33:41,754 --> 00:33:45,360
Sure, I have! Want to see
the results of all my training?

507
00:33:52,011 --> 00:33:54,055
Sexy Jutsu!

508
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,769
How's that?

509
00:33:55,794 --> 00:33:57,546
Here! There!

510
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,875
He's as stupid as ever...

511
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,131
And that's why Naruto is Naruto.

512
00:34:02,834 --> 00:34:03,835
<i>Byakugan!</i>

513
00:34:07,449 --> 00:34:10,169
All right, I'm going to take part
in this test too.

514
00:34:10,194 --> 00:34:12,759
But you need a team of three.

515
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:16,320
I just came home and
there's no one left,

516
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:19,515
so I'll just ask them to
make an exception.

517
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,429
Huh?!

518
00:34:24,445 --> 00:34:25,621
What's the big idea?

519
00:34:26,434 --> 00:34:28,221
Don't get mad at Konohamaru!

520
00:34:29,461 --> 00:34:31,194
Are you all right, Konohamaru?

521
00:34:31,801 --> 00:34:34,530
It's all for Big Brother Naruto.

522
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,461
Naruto?

523
00:34:36,669 --> 00:34:39,786
Because Big Brother can't take this exam.

524
00:34:40,651 --> 00:34:42,861
It's because he won't be able
to be a Chunin.

525
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,917
So you tried to take it
for him instead...

526
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,887
A stand-in test taker...

527
00:34:50,545 --> 00:34:52,631
You don't need to worry
about him.

528
00:34:53,893 --> 00:34:59,152
Naruto is someone who'll keep striving
to become Hokage, regardless of rank.

529
00:34:59,436 --> 00:35:00,259
He's right.

530
00:35:00,885 --> 00:35:03,679
And when he returns,
we'll welcome him with a big smile.

531
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,606
I got it.

532
00:35:10,688 --> 00:35:12,026
Next in line.

533
00:35:17,298 --> 00:35:18,299
One.

534
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,325
Three...

535
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,409
Two...

536
00:35:20,633 --> 00:35:23,609
Okay, leave the lots and
go to your assigned rooms.

537
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:26,376
Room One is
the classroom up ahead.

538
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,252
Rooms Two and Three
are up the stairs.

539
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:31,043
Huh? We're being separated?

540
00:35:31,167 --> 00:35:32,877
We're on our own?

541
00:35:34,066 --> 00:35:35,067
I'm in Room One.

542
00:35:47,663 --> 00:35:48,450
Oh!

543
00:35:48,918 --> 00:35:50,127
Big Brother Neji!

544
00:35:56,642 --> 00:35:58,560
Why were we separated
from our teams?

545
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,741
I have no idea.

546
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:07,969
Huh?

547
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:13,796
It won't open.

548
00:36:14,195 --> 00:36:15,238
I wonder what's happening?

549
00:36:15,625 --> 00:36:17,002
Isn't the proctor coming?

550
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:19,202
They're planning something...

551
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,596
Heh, bring it on!

552
00:36:22,564 --> 00:36:23,774
There's a stack of papers here.

553
00:36:24,042 --> 00:36:26,044
You shouldn't go around
carelessly touching things...

554
00:36:26,547 --> 00:36:27,632
Uh... Ahem!

555
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,191
<i>I am Shikamaru Nara,</i>

556
00:36:33,216 --> 00:36:35,260
<i>the proctor for the first test
of the Chunin Exam.</i>

557
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:39,322
<i>Participants, take one sheet from
the stack on the teacher's desk,</i>

558
00:36:39,479 --> 00:36:41,324
<i>then take any seat.</i>

559
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,535
The first test is a written one,
after all.

560
00:36:45,854 --> 00:36:48,232
Oh good, it's the same as usual.

561
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,942
Is everyone seated?

562
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:07,332
This is a drag,
so let's get right to it.

563
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,060
<i>This is a drag for him?</i>

564
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,394
<i>We're serious about this!</i>

565
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:14,999
You guys are lucky.
I'm in charge this year.

566
00:37:15,583 --> 00:37:16,901
He might be right.

567
00:37:17,397 --> 00:37:18,163
Why?

568
00:37:18,563 --> 00:37:21,036
He won't do anything unreasonable.

569
00:37:21,738 --> 00:37:23,339
<i>The first test is a written one.</i>

570
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,228
<i>Read the questions carefully.</i>

571
00:37:26,261 --> 00:37:27,929
Three questions...

572
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:31,749
<i>The three questions are worth,
from the top:</i>

573
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:34,752
<i>30 points, 40 points,
and 50 points.</i>

574
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,088
A perfect score is 120 points?

575
00:37:37,706 --> 00:37:38,957
Not 100?

576
00:37:39,309 --> 00:37:42,895
<i>Each of you will answer
just one of three questions.</i>

577
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,514
<i>Your team's total score will
determine if you pass or fail.</i>

578
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:51,644
<i>If your team total exceeds 100,
the team is disqualified.</i>

579
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:53,813
That's crazy!

580
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,885
Then, for example...

581
00:37:56,576 --> 00:38:00,038
If the three have...
30, 30, 50 for 110 points...

582
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:03,114
30, 40, 40 for 110 points...

583
00:38:03,507 --> 00:38:06,093
or 40, 40, 40 for 120 points...

584
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:09,412
<i>These totals will
disqualify them, right?</i>

585
00:38:09,437 --> 00:38:12,232
Then we'll take the average
of the teams who remain...

586
00:38:12,569 --> 00:38:15,515
and any teams who score below
that average will be disqualified.

587
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,245
<i>Those over the average will pass.</i>

588
00:38:18,597 --> 00:38:19,890
An average score?

589
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,134
Of the teams' totals...?

590
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:24,676
Just a minute.

591
00:38:24,701 --> 00:38:26,244
How are we supposed to...?!

592
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:27,888
<i>The test starts now.</i>

593
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:36,613
Which question should I solve?

594
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:46,907
I don't understand this test at all!

595
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:52,830
This test isn't just about
solving the questions...

596
00:38:53,293 --> 00:38:56,046
Please don't say things that
will confuse me even more!

597
00:38:56,433 --> 00:38:59,477
<i>The three questions aren't that hard.</i>

598
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,040
<i>Unless you're really dumb,</i>

599
00:39:02,211 --> 00:39:04,138
<i>anyone can solve
the 50-point question too.</i>

600
00:39:04,359 --> 00:39:05,668
<i>Don't underestimate me!</i>

601
00:39:05,889 --> 00:39:08,391
<i>I won't run! I'll take this test!</i>

602
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:10,550
<i>I don't care if I have to stay
a Genin for the rest of my life,</i>

603
00:39:10,575 --> 00:39:14,204
<i>because I'll be Hokage someday,
no matter what!</i>

604
00:39:16,318 --> 00:39:17,790
<i>Come to think of it...</i>

605
00:39:17,815 --> 00:39:19,442
<i>there was a guy
who was really that dumb...</i>

606
00:39:20,102 --> 00:39:23,468
<i>He couldn't solve a single question
in the first test, but he passed.</i>

607
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,071
<i>Which means...</i>

608
00:39:26,096 --> 00:39:27,734
<i>They're not testing
our problem-solving skills.</i>

609
00:39:27,759 --> 00:39:30,637
<i>It's the same as the last time!</i>

610
00:39:34,901 --> 00:39:35,986
<i>Now then...</i>

611
00:39:36,429 --> 00:39:40,297
<i>100 points is either...
30, 30 and 40...</i>

612
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:43,621
<i>Or 50, 50 and 0.</i>

613
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:10,408
<i>It's been sealed off.</i>

614
00:40:11,728 --> 00:40:13,160
Big Brother Neji?

615
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,339
Double-paned windows, huh...

616
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,217
They made sure that
we couldn't contact our teammates.

617
00:40:28,242 --> 00:40:30,827
Should you be moving around like that?

618
00:40:31,352 --> 00:40:35,532
We were told a few rules,
but no one's cautioned us yet

619
00:40:35,557 --> 00:40:37,365
for talking like this.

620
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,519
I see...

621
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:43,995
So, they don't care whether we cheat or not.

622
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,092
That's right...

623
00:40:45,117 --> 00:40:48,162
Last time, the first test
was all about cheating.

624
00:40:53,924 --> 00:40:54,925
It won't open...

625
00:40:55,672 --> 00:40:59,045
Leave it to Shikamaru...
This is a difficult problem.

626
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:05,164
If you can contact your teammates,
you gain an advantage for this test...

627
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:08,674
But no one on my team has that kind
of ninjutsu.

628
00:41:08,907 --> 00:41:11,589
I wonder if Shino has any ideas...

629
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:17,016
The only thing left is to try to guess
which question my teammate will solve.

630
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:20,145
If we choose the number
we each picked...

631
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:23,397
our point total will be over 100.

632
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:26,442
Going over 100 points
means immediate disqualification.

633
00:41:26,541 --> 00:41:28,835
We have to avoid that at all cost.

634
00:41:29,633 --> 00:41:34,305
If one of us scores zero points,
we'll avoid going over 100, right?

635
00:41:35,094 --> 00:41:36,331
But there's no guarantee

636
00:41:36,356 --> 00:41:38,900
that the other two will each answer
the 50-point question.

637
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,249
And if the point total is too low,

638
00:41:42,324 --> 00:41:45,744
we'll likely be disqualified
for scoring below the average.

639
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:51,258
If all of us solve the 30-point question
and get 90 points,

640
00:41:51,525 --> 00:41:54,811
we'll lose to the team
that has 100.

641
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:57,681
If many teams score 100 points,

642
00:41:57,882 --> 00:42:01,710
and raise the average, teams with
90 points will be disqualified.

643
00:42:06,966 --> 00:42:09,899
I guess finding
a loophole seems impossible.

644
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:16,879
The choices are 30, 30, 40
or 0, 50, 50 to score 100 points.

645
00:42:17,425 --> 00:42:18,475
So the question is...

646
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:22,161
figuring out which question
each team member will solve.

647
00:42:22,597 --> 00:42:26,779
How should I know what
questions Ino and Sakura will pick?

648
00:42:27,337 --> 00:42:29,919
What would Shino and Kiba do?

649
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:34,112
Those two are probably wondering
the same thing right now.

650
00:42:35,313 --> 00:42:37,983
Got it! I finally figured it out!

651
00:42:38,008 --> 00:42:39,425
Huh? You did?

652
00:42:39,588 --> 00:42:40,172
Yes!

653
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:43,000
I solved the 50-point question!

654
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,354
Oh... I see.

655
00:42:45,661 --> 00:42:47,120
I'm not going to show you.

656
00:42:47,145 --> 00:42:48,271
I won't look.

657
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:49,755
I don't have to look.

658
00:43:09,146 --> 00:43:10,147
<i>Who are you?</i>

659
00:43:11,183 --> 00:43:12,938
<i>You don't seem to be
an Insect User, but...</i>

660
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:17,052
I hate to say this,
but if Naruto were here,

661
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:20,389
this first test would be easy.

662
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,182
Huh? Why?

663
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:25,060
I mean, he'd score zero for sure.

664
00:43:25,691 --> 00:43:29,820
I think even Naruto could
solve this 30-point question.

665
00:43:29,992 --> 00:43:31,535
Definitely not.

666
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,319
Leave it to Naruto...

667
00:43:33,674 --> 00:43:37,886
It would be much simpler if Lee
on our team were that obviously dumb.

668
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,285
Umm... Excuse me.

669
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,411
Yes?

670
00:43:42,819 --> 00:43:44,612
Can you tell me just what
we're supposed to do

671
00:43:44,637 --> 00:43:46,222
for this first test?

672
00:43:47,108 --> 00:43:49,152
That's what we're trying
to figure out!

673
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:51,503
You too, huh?

674
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:54,465
These questions are
really hard, aren't they?

675
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:56,704
Well... yeah.

676
00:44:01,887 --> 00:44:03,514
Wouldn't you think
the safest thing to do

677
00:44:03,776 --> 00:44:06,885
is for each of us to choose
the 30-point question?

678
00:44:07,326 --> 00:44:10,288
Didn't he say something
about the average score too?

679
00:44:10,867 --> 00:44:14,954
I see... We have to score 100 points,
no matter what.

680
00:44:15,435 --> 00:44:19,073
I can't even figure out
how to get 100 points.

681
00:44:20,808 --> 00:44:22,519
And time keeps on ticking away...

682
00:44:29,176 --> 00:44:33,055
<i>I've trained hard... I'll try it.</i>

683
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:35,480
<i>First, I have to sense those two.</i>

684
00:44:49,969 --> 00:44:52,430
<i>Hey, you two, please listen...</i>

685
00:44:54,913 --> 00:44:55,914
<i>Is that you, Fuu?</i>

686
00:44:57,643 --> 00:44:58,644
<i>All right.</i>

687
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:06,370
What are you up to?

688
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:09,039
<i>My teammates...</i>

689
00:45:15,327 --> 00:45:16,328
<i>Sensory Jutsu!</i>

690
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:22,010
<i>Four...? I see...</i>

691
00:45:26,384 --> 00:45:27,636
I don't get it.

692
00:45:27,942 --> 00:45:28,651
<i>Choji...</i>

693
00:45:28,698 --> 00:45:29,699
Huh?!

694
00:45:30,575 --> 00:45:34,287
<i>I'll solve the 40-point question,
so Choji, you do the 30-pointer.</i>

695
00:45:34,953 --> 00:45:36,868
Oh, okay. Okay!

696
00:45:37,542 --> 00:45:39,502
<i>I'll get Sakura to do the 30-pointer too.</i>

697
00:45:43,098 --> 00:45:45,440
Hey, Gennai! Inaho!

698
00:45:45,653 --> 00:45:46,980
Can you hear me?!

699
00:45:47,795 --> 00:45:49,772
Tanzo, Minoji!

700
00:45:49,797 --> 00:45:50,840
It's me!

701
00:45:50,865 --> 00:45:52,908
– It's me!
– Hey! It's me!

702
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,252
– What are you trying to do?
– Can you hear me?

703
00:45:55,277 --> 00:45:57,780
At this rate,
no one's voice will be heard.

704
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:04,161
Do you hear something?

705
00:46:05,104 --> 00:46:07,291
Is someone yelling?

706
00:46:07,632 --> 00:46:08,466
That's right!

707
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:10,809
If they can hear me
on the other side...!

708
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,728
Hey!

709
00:46:13,047 --> 00:46:14,757
Can you hear me?!

710
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,321
I can hear something.

711
00:46:22,372 --> 00:46:23,832
Someone's yelling.

712
00:46:24,252 --> 00:46:25,670
A lot of people are yelling.

713
00:46:25,887 --> 00:46:26,888
I see.

714
00:46:27,207 --> 00:46:28,459
Hey!

715
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:30,902
Komugi, Gennai!

716
00:46:33,235 --> 00:46:34,194
Yahoo!

717
00:46:34,219 --> 00:46:35,387
Yahoo!

718
00:46:43,075 --> 00:46:44,368
Shouldn't we stop them?!

719
00:46:45,287 --> 00:46:47,831
If I stop them,
this test would be meaningless.

720
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:52,884
Now then, who's going to do what?

721
00:46:53,586 --> 00:46:55,963
I'll do the 50-point question!

722
00:46:56,195 --> 00:46:58,030
I'll do the 40-point one!

723
00:46:58,375 --> 00:46:59,942
It's so noisy.

724
00:47:00,021 --> 00:47:01,855
Who can hear over all this?

725
00:47:03,066 --> 00:47:05,110
There's shouting in
the other classes too.

726
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,741
Everyone's voices are blending together...

727
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,701
So nothing can be communicated.

728
00:47:11,413 --> 00:47:13,123
<i>Nothing can be communicated?</i>

729
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:15,624
<i>Just watch...</i>

730
00:47:16,351 --> 00:47:17,561
<i>Sand Letters!</i>

731
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:27,324
<i>"I'll do the 40-point question."</i>

732
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:30,472
<i>It's Sajin!</i>

733
00:47:31,068 --> 00:47:33,680
<i>He wants us to do the 30-pointer.</i>

734
00:47:35,303 --> 00:47:37,806
<i>With that we'll total 100 points.</i>

735
00:47:38,268 --> 00:47:39,644
<i>Those fools...</i>

736
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:42,526
Lady Hinata...

737
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,904
Let's continue your lesson here.

738
00:47:46,361 --> 00:47:48,447
What are you saying, Big Brother Neji?

739
00:47:49,316 --> 00:47:51,276
There's something I want to try.

740
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:54,496
All right.

741
00:47:58,209 --> 00:47:59,627
Perform the Eight Trigrams: Air Palm...

742
00:48:01,124 --> 00:48:02,125
with all your might.

743
00:48:09,241 --> 00:48:10,856
<i>– Eight Trigrams: Air Palm!
– Eight Trigrams: Air Palm!</i>

744
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:14,850
Wh-What the—?!

745
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,029
Hey...

746
00:48:27,894 --> 00:48:28,895
You guys...

747
00:48:29,718 --> 00:48:31,533
What the hell are you guys doing?!

748
00:48:33,931 --> 00:48:38,269
Showing you the answer
to the question.

749
00:48:40,534 --> 00:48:44,121
Any idiot can solve
a question like this.

750
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:45,731
– Huh?
– Yeah, he's right.

751
00:48:48,264 --> 00:48:50,994
So what question
are you going to solve?

752
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:53,472
Why should I tell you?

753
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:56,842
Everyone is in a dilemma
because they don't know...

754
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:58,202
<i>which one to solve.</i>

755
00:48:59,454 --> 00:49:01,343
<i>It's because they don't know</i>

756
00:49:01,368 --> 00:49:02,911
<i>which ones their teammates
will choose.</i>

757
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,233
Neji is planning something.

758
00:49:06,616 --> 00:49:11,455
But why would he tell the others
what he plans to do?

759
00:49:13,233 --> 00:49:16,220
The method he plans
to use probably necessitates it.

760
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:19,173
Do you know?

761
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:22,083
I don't know about
my teammates either.

762
00:49:22,364 --> 00:49:23,908
What is that supposed to mean?

763
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:28,298
But if there's a way to let them know
how many points I'll get,

764
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,883
I can solve the question.

765
00:49:30,797 --> 00:49:32,204
That's if you can let them know.

766
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:35,116
I'll communicate the number
to the next room with vibration.

767
00:49:37,577 --> 00:49:39,538
I'll send four vibrations
through the wall.

768
00:49:39,978 --> 00:49:43,106
I'll relay the information without
leaving the room or destroying it.

769
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:48,987
But will just hitting the wall
get your message across?

770
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:52,447
How would you interpret
four bangs on the wall?

771
00:49:53,015 --> 00:49:56,811
If I should hear four signals...?

772
00:49:59,998 --> 00:50:03,875
That wouldn't mean the other person
and I should score 40 points.

773
00:50:04,467 --> 00:50:07,178
If two takes 40 each,
that's 80 points.

774
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:10,173
Then if the one
who signaled takes 50,

775
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:13,760
40, 30, 0 points...

776
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:17,681
None of the combinations
totals 100.

777
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:24,606
So it can be interpreted that the one
who signaled will take the 40-pointer.

778
00:50:25,885 --> 00:50:28,554
And the other two
can take the 30-pointers.

779
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:32,988
– I see.
– That makes sense.

780
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:36,363
I wonder if Gennai and Inaho
will think the same way.

781
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:39,247
I hope Minoji and Tanzo
are okay.

782
00:50:39,851 --> 00:50:42,396
Each village selected three Genin

783
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:44,875
to make up their teams for the Chunin Exam.

784
00:50:45,857 --> 00:50:48,235
Everyone just has
to trust their teammates.

785
00:50:50,001 --> 00:50:52,837
But why would you teach this
to all of us?

786
00:50:53,513 --> 00:50:56,099
If I suddenly pounded
on the wall four times,

787
00:50:56,124 --> 00:50:57,292
what would you think?

788
00:50:57,657 --> 00:50:59,894
Well... Naturally, I'd get suspicious.

789
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:01,959
You would, right?

790
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:06,605
And I didn't want you guys
to do something and interfere.

791
00:51:06,989 --> 00:51:09,992
I figured I'd come clean
and let everyone in on this,

792
00:51:10,017 --> 00:51:14,325
and we can all pass
this stupid written test.

793
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:16,018
All of us?!

794
00:51:16,522 --> 00:51:17,673
So that's his plan.

795
00:51:17,893 --> 00:51:21,605
Everybody passes...
He really got you there, Proctor.

796
00:51:21,768 --> 00:51:25,313
Well, I've gotten a good look
at his leadership skills.

797
00:51:29,514 --> 00:51:30,848
<i>All of us?</i>

798
00:51:33,061 --> 00:51:35,396
I see... You're right.

799
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:40,180
But how about letting me pass on
the info to the other classes?

800
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:42,974
Sure, but why?

801
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:45,735
I can't let the Hidden Leaf
do all the work.

802
00:51:46,114 --> 00:51:48,241
I'll take the blame if
the classroom is damaged.

803
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:50,232
I just have to send vibrations, right?

804
00:51:50,937 --> 00:51:51,645
Yes.

805
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:58,541
One!

806
00:52:00,495 --> 00:52:01,955
Two! Three!

807
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:05,622
Four!

808
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,173
Hey, that was five times!

809
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:16,466
What are you doing?

810
00:52:17,415 --> 00:52:19,292
Everyone passes?

811
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:22,139
You've got to be kidding.

812
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:25,513
What's the point of a test
if no one gets eliminated?!

813
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:27,727
Wh-Why you...!

814
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,938
– What a jerk!
– What's going on?

815
00:52:31,187 --> 00:52:32,605
It's too late now.

816
00:52:33,089 --> 00:52:34,673
If you send four vibrations again,

817
00:52:34,698 --> 00:52:36,158
you'll only add
to the confusion.

818
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:38,947
It doesn't matter
if it's five times.

819
00:52:39,009 --> 00:52:39,592
What?

820
00:52:40,197 --> 00:52:41,615
Three times is fine too.

821
00:52:42,086 --> 00:52:44,088
As long as the message gets out,
anyone can do it.

822
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:49,184
Anyone? Three, four, or five...
They're all the same?

823
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:52,711
Yes. Well, it's slightly different.

824
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:56,631
The question I pick will change.

825
00:52:56,763 --> 00:52:57,551
Huh?

826
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:03,555
<i>I see...</i>

827
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:09,352
That was a signal of some sort.

828
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:13,690
It's definitely more efficient
than yelling something out.

829
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:15,358
But why five times?

830
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,904
Five times must mean
the 50-point question.

831
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:20,681
So what are we supposed to do?

832
00:53:21,155 --> 00:53:22,156
I get it...

833
00:53:23,264 --> 00:53:24,598
Even with three times,

834
00:53:24,623 --> 00:53:26,458
my intention
would have been communicated.

835
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:29,915
In that case,
I'd take the 40-pointer.

836
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,293
How can you tell?

837
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:38,798
If the grouping is 30, 30,
and 40 for 100 points,

838
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:41,718
whoever sent the signal
won't take 30.

839
00:53:42,076 --> 00:53:44,119
Because that'll leave
the remaining two

840
00:53:44,144 --> 00:53:47,147
to decide between 30 and 40 points,
and that won't work.

841
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:50,560
So whoever signals takes
the 40-pointer,

842
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:53,230
leaving the 30-pointer
to his two teammates.

843
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:57,108
Damn you.
Why didn't you explain that earlier?

844
00:53:57,487 --> 00:54:00,907
I made it clear, didn't I?
That I didn't want any interference.

845
00:54:01,763 --> 00:54:03,340
I was concerned that jutsu users

846
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,450
who can communicate silently
with their teammates

847
00:54:05,475 --> 00:54:08,801
would foil my plan for everyone
to pass this test.

848
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:11,706
You can, right?

849
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:22,717
No one will get in my way.

850
00:54:30,994 --> 00:54:32,993
Well, you're not getting in my way!

851
00:54:39,579 --> 00:54:42,039
Proctor, are you going
to allow fighting?!

852
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:46,157
If you don't reply,
I'll assume you are.

853
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:48,368
You want to fight?

854
00:54:48,593 --> 00:54:50,678
Proctor, give us permission!

855
00:54:52,527 --> 00:54:54,571
<i>I made it clear that the first test
is a written one.</i>

856
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,626
<i>Fighting is prohibited!</i>

857
00:54:57,092 --> 00:54:59,754
<i>Stop that racket and answer
the question before the time's up!</i>

858
00:55:00,542 --> 00:55:01,543
You heard him.

859
00:55:05,059 --> 00:55:08,771
That Neji...
He even forced a hint out of me.

860
00:55:09,066 --> 00:55:10,693
In that warning you just issued?

861
00:55:11,284 --> 00:55:16,554
Until now, there was a possibility
that the others would think

862
00:55:16,635 --> 00:55:20,542
I was the one who
pounded five times.

863
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:24,650
I warned them to keep quiet just now,
thus raising the possibility

864
00:55:24,675 --> 00:55:27,130
that it was someone in
a classroom who made those sounds.

865
00:55:27,384 --> 00:55:29,136
And in truth, it was.

866
00:55:29,363 --> 00:55:31,448
So every team will score 100 points?

867
00:55:31,764 --> 00:55:34,267
No, not necessarily.

868
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:56,561
If they rationalize it calmly,
they'd agree with Neji...

869
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:58,855
But just how calm can they remain?

870
00:55:59,477 --> 00:56:01,813
How much faith they have
in their teammates

871
00:56:01,973 --> 00:56:03,725
is another problem altogether.

872
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,780
What's the answer
that you prepared?

873
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:08,239
You're asking me?

874
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:11,034
If I were one of the test-takers,

875
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:14,069
I'd use my Shadow Possession Jutsu...

876
00:56:14,366 --> 00:56:19,121
But this question wouldn't exist
if I weren't the proctor.

877
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:22,665
That's why there is no point
in me answering that question.

878
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,298
What are you quibbling about?

879
00:56:25,752 --> 00:56:28,483
Anyway, it all boils down
to thinking carefully

880
00:56:28,702 --> 00:56:30,781
about your teammates
and the situation.

881
00:56:31,603 --> 00:56:34,731
Still, there's bound to
be many who pass.

882
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:36,976
And that'll make
the second test a pain.

883
00:56:37,196 --> 00:56:39,282
I won't make trouble
for the Hidden Sand.

884
00:56:40,074 --> 00:56:41,993
There's another part to this test.

885
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:48,187
<i>Time's up.</i>

886
00:56:48,683 --> 00:56:51,228
<i>Everyone, flip your sheets over.</i>

887
00:56:54,823 --> 00:56:56,481
Continuing to the second part
of this exam.

888
00:56:56,759 --> 00:56:57,760
– What?!
– Huh?!

889
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:58,998
<i>Question.</i>

890
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:01,835
<i>Your team is on a mission
and the enemy spots you.</i>

891
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:03,890
<i>In order to shake off
their pursuit,</i>

892
00:57:03,915 --> 00:57:05,959
<i>one teammate must stay behind
as a decoy.</i>

893
00:57:05,984 --> 00:57:07,918
<i>Who will you choose...</i>

894
00:57:07,943 --> 00:57:10,654
<i>knowing that the decoy
faces certain death?</i>

895
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:14,857
<i>Write your answer on
the reverse side of the sheet.</i>

896
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:16,934
<i>In order to pass,</i>

897
00:57:16,959 --> 00:57:19,060
<i>all three members on the team
must have the same answer.</i>

898
00:57:19,932 --> 00:57:23,222
<i>And the member named as
the decoy will be considered killed</i>

899
00:57:23,247 --> 00:57:25,699
<i>and eliminated from the Chunin Exam.</i>

900
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:28,862
<i>You have three minutes for this.</i>

901
00:57:31,899 --> 00:57:32,949
Begin!

902
00:57:40,581 --> 00:57:42,499
<i>How does he expect us to choose...?</i>

903
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:45,712
<i>Sand Letters...</i>

904
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,350
<i>So we'll go with Mijin?</i>

905
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:57,682
<i>Me?!</i>

906
00:58:03,032 --> 00:58:03,843
<i>Damn it...</i>

907
00:58:12,017 --> 00:58:15,187
<i>In our old Team 7,
it would have been Naruto.</i>

908
00:58:15,815 --> 00:58:18,359
<i>Because he would probably
write his own name down.</i>

909
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:21,289
<i>The answer isn't Naruto.</i>

910
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:23,875
<i>My teammates now
are Ino and Choji...</i>

911
00:58:24,148 --> 00:58:25,149
<i>So...</i>

912
00:58:25,174 --> 00:58:26,175
<i>Sakura!</i>

913
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:30,089
<i>What'll we do?
I can't choose either of you!</i>

914
00:58:30,506 --> 00:58:32,826
<i>What is Shikamaru thinking?</i>

915
00:58:33,735 --> 00:58:35,862
<i>Ino, please relay this to Choji too.</i>

916
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:36,888
<i>The answer is...</i>

917
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,725
<i>Huh?! But that's...!</i>

918
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:54,447
I'll be collecting your papers.

919
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:57,116
Wait in your classrooms
until the papers are graded.

920
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:00,828
<i>Those who passed will be
called out to the courtyard.</i>

921
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:10,004
You rarely visit.
To what do I owe this pleasure?

922
00:59:10,982 --> 00:59:14,110
There's something you need to know.

923
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:27,689
You don't need Hidden Leaf proctors
for the second test?

924
00:59:28,181 --> 00:59:31,268
The Hidden Sand would like
to handle everything ourselves.

925
00:59:31,992 --> 00:59:32,944
And the reason for that?

926
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,530
The site of the second test
is known as the Demon Desert.

927
00:59:35,792 --> 00:59:38,628
It's extremely dangerous even for
those of us familiar with the terrain.

928
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:41,411
For the sake of security,
we ask for your understanding.

929
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:45,782
For whose security, may I ask?

930
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:50,003
Naturally, for the participants.

931
00:59:50,856 --> 00:59:52,608
The Jonin in charge of the entrants

932
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:54,740
will accompany them
to the Hidden Sand Village.

933
00:59:55,221 --> 00:59:56,514
That is not open to negotiation.

934
00:59:57,443 --> 00:59:59,679
Yes, that's fine.

935
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:07,395
What do you think?

936
01:00:07,578 --> 01:00:08,871
Sounds suspicious.

937
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:11,312
Yes, they are hiding something.

938
01:00:11,989 --> 01:00:14,658
But the Sand are not the only ones.

939
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,741
How have the Hidden Rain responded?

940
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:21,659
Danzo asked to see us earlier.

941
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,496
Even though he's confined
under house arrest,

942
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:28,291
he still has his connections.

943
01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:35,231
You are aware that I helped
Hanzo of the Salamander,

944
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:38,217
the leader of the Hidden Rain Village?

945
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:42,847
That was when you were
in charge of the Foundation.

946
01:00:43,859 --> 01:00:48,656
I continued to communicate with him
secretly even after I was ousted.

947
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,397
Danzo, you didn't...?

948
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:55,401
But Hanzo abruptly
stopped contacting me.

949
01:00:56,317 --> 01:00:58,236
If he stopped trusting me,

950
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:01,056
he would've lured me out
and killed me

951
01:01:01,081 --> 01:01:02,708
since I know so many secrets.

952
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:04,035
But he didn't.

953
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:06,996
Something has happened to Hanzo.

954
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:08,748
Like what?

955
01:01:15,426 --> 01:01:19,565
I believe there's been
an incident in Hidden Rain Village.

956
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:23,721
In the worst case,
he's no longer in this world...

957
01:01:23,921 --> 01:01:24,811
How can that be?

958
01:01:25,051 --> 01:01:28,271
On the outside, Hanzo is still
the leader of the Hidden Rain Village.

959
01:01:29,104 --> 01:01:31,065
Please warn Princess Tsunade

960
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:37,192
to be extremely wary of the entrants
sent by the Hidden Rain.

961
01:01:39,951 --> 01:01:41,327
Well, you have been warned.

962
01:01:42,369 --> 01:01:44,413
Danzo of all people asked you this?

963
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:49,914
He may be called a hardliner
and the darkness of the shinobi world...

964
01:01:50,178 --> 01:01:51,930
But there is no doubt

965
01:01:51,955 --> 01:01:54,207
that he operates all for
the sake of the Hidden Leaf.

966
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,339
The Hidden Rain, eh...

967
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,008
We must increase surveillance.

968
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,553
There's also the Sand to think of.

969
01:02:05,293 --> 01:02:08,672
I will inform the Jonin in charge
of the entrants about this.

970
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:12,395
Just the Jonin of the teams
who pass the first test?

971
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:13,730
Yes.

972
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:24,490
Damn it...

973
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:28,828
Well...

974
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:34,000
Those of you here have passed
the first test. Congratulations.

975
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:37,511
Neji, you sent that signal, right?

976
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:39,460
Thanks to you, we made it.

977
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:43,134
Actually, it was that guy from
the Hidden Sand.

978
01:02:44,218 --> 01:02:46,679
How come all three of you made it?

979
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:50,099
Didn't the decoy get disqualified?

980
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:53,311
The rule said all three had
to have the same answer.

981
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:55,855
We didn't choose anyone.

982
01:02:56,062 --> 01:02:56,599
What?!

983
01:02:56,838 --> 01:02:58,256
We all turned in a blank sheet.

984
01:02:58,823 --> 01:03:00,742
Blank? All three of you?!

985
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:04,475
There's no way we'd sacrifice
a comrade.

986
01:03:05,995 --> 01:03:06,781
Take a look...

987
01:03:06,896 --> 01:03:10,357
at how many teams passed
with all three members.

988
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:19,378
I'm sorry I couldn't figure out
the question.

989
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:20,379
It's okay!

990
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:23,441
We coordinated things
with that in mind.

991
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:24,134
I know!

992
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:26,552
I trusted you two and
didn't write anything.

993
01:03:26,649 --> 01:03:28,108
More like couldn't, right?

994
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:30,932
You guys!

995
01:03:30,957 --> 01:03:32,679
We passed the first test!

996
01:03:34,682 --> 01:03:38,269
You can transfer thoughts,
but that backfired on you, eh.

997
01:03:39,056 --> 01:03:40,182
Well...

998
01:03:40,207 --> 01:03:45,212
Thinking about letting a teammate die
was already the wrong answer.

999
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:47,698
Why you...

1000
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:51,285
I'm Temari of the Hidden Sand.

1001
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:53,287
I'm in charge of the second test.

1002
01:03:53,387 --> 01:03:55,598
Too many teams passed the first test,

1003
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:58,292
so we're going to narrow it down
some more.

1004
01:03:58,715 --> 01:04:00,341
Hey, what do you mean
"narrow it down"?!

1005
01:04:00,528 --> 01:04:02,970
First off, the second test is also
a team battle.

1006
01:04:03,418 --> 01:04:06,504
Any team without its third member
will be disqualified!

1007
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:07,593
What?!

1008
01:04:08,059 --> 01:04:11,646
Furthermore, the second test will be held
in the Hidden Sand Village.

1009
01:04:12,109 --> 01:04:14,611
We will meet at
the Demon Desert checkpoint.

1010
01:04:15,111 --> 01:04:16,511
Although there is a clear route

1011
01:04:16,536 --> 01:04:18,621
between the Hidden Leaf
and the Hidden Sand Village,

1012
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:22,400
it will take a shinobi three days,
no matter how fast he or she may be.

1013
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:30,908
A messenger hawk has been sent to
the Hidden Sand with these instructions.

1014
01:04:31,276 --> 01:04:35,280
"After the first 30 arrive,
all who follow are to be disqualified."

1015
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:41,874
Finally, as in the first test,
fighting is prohibited en route.

1016
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:45,214
You can fight to your heart's content
in the second test.

1017
01:04:45,504 --> 01:04:46,505
That is all.

1018
01:04:46,757 --> 01:04:47,758
Lee, Tenten...

1019
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:54,181
He's quick to assess a situation,
after all.

1020
01:04:54,748 --> 01:04:57,292
What's wrong?
You're dismissed!

1021
01:04:59,103 --> 01:05:00,187
Ino, Choji!

1022
01:05:05,330 --> 01:05:07,332
Couldn't you at least
have said, "ready, set, go"?

1023
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:10,948
This is the Chunin Exam.
Not the Academy.

1024
01:05:11,544 --> 01:05:12,128
Huh?

1025
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:14,479
– Hey, Yukata!
– Get moving!

1026
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:20,583
Maybe next time, we should stick
to an ordinary scholastic test.

1027
01:05:24,333 --> 01:05:25,918
Let's get there first!

1028
01:05:26,691 --> 01:05:29,736
There's no advantage
to being the first to arrive.

1029
01:05:36,679 --> 01:05:37,680
<i>Byakugan!</i>

1030
01:05:41,283 --> 01:05:42,910
There's one team ahead of us.

1031
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:05,336
Lord Kazekage...

1032
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:08,652
The first test of the Chunin Exam is over.

1033
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:12,718
The participants are now heading
towards the Hidden Sand Village.

1034
01:06:13,417 --> 01:06:14,293
I see.

1035
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:19,308
Get ready for the second test.

1036
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:46,168
Where are you trying to go?

1037
01:06:47,671 --> 01:06:49,730
The Kazekage's quarters
are beyond here.

1038
01:06:52,158 --> 01:06:53,285
Hold it!

1039
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:56,342
Who the hell are you?!

1040
01:06:57,722 --> 01:07:00,029
We seek to reform the Land of Wind!

1041
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:07,398
You think I'd let you get away?!

1042
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:17,247
You have nowhere to run...

1043
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:28,878
Divine Punishment!

1044
01:07:31,262 --> 01:07:32,263
Take cover!

1045
01:07:50,281 --> 01:07:51,949
Oh, you're back.

1046
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:53,509
Damn it...

1047
01:07:54,019 --> 01:07:55,479
Be more careful.

1048
01:08:00,877 --> 01:08:03,295
You wanted to talk to me?

1049
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:08,379
Please, Gaara, forget about
supervising the Chunin Exam.

1050
01:08:09,296 --> 01:08:12,258
The people targeting you
are stepping up their efforts.

1051
01:08:12,825 --> 01:08:15,661
You'll just be playing into
their hands if you continue this!

1052
01:08:16,461 --> 01:08:18,171
I already know that.

1053
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:20,886
But if I quit because of that,

1054
01:08:20,911 --> 01:08:24,081
it would be like declaring that
I will cave in under pressure.

1055
01:08:24,741 --> 01:08:26,243
Maybe so, but...

1056
01:08:27,144 --> 01:08:28,896
But this is only the Chunin Exam!

1057
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:39,365
<i>The Chunin Exam is where
everything began for me.</i>

1058
01:08:40,497 --> 01:08:43,375
Thanks to him, I've made it this far.

1059
01:08:45,896 --> 01:08:48,399
I'll make sure this Chunin Exam
is a success...

1060
01:08:48,424 --> 01:08:50,509
... without fail.

1061
01:09:00,988 --> 01:09:03,365
We've finally reached
the Hidden Sand territory.

1062
01:09:03,764 --> 01:09:06,016
All right, let's go to
the second test site.

1063
01:09:09,547 --> 01:09:11,508
Sarutobi-sensei! Yuhi-sensei!

1064
01:09:12,069 --> 01:09:15,072
Sorry, but this is as far as you'll go.

1065
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:18,404
Late arrivals are disqualified.

1066
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:20,990
If you're from the Hidden Leaf,
return to the village.

1067
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:24,451
The rest of you can disperse
from here too.

1068
01:09:24,545 --> 01:09:27,590
But we ran nonstop for
three days to get here!

1069
01:09:28,207 --> 01:09:31,502
If you're complaining,

1070
01:09:31,527 --> 01:09:33,821
then maybe it's for the best
that you're being eliminated.

1071
01:09:36,052 --> 01:09:38,054
Because beyond this point is hell.

1072
01:09:38,101 --> 01:09:41,188
And who knows if you'll even
get out of there alive.

1073
01:09:46,083 --> 01:09:49,607
Sakura! Everyone!
You made it!

1074
01:09:50,175 --> 01:09:55,013
I must admit,
Guy-sensei's team sure has stamina.

1075
01:09:55,386 --> 01:09:57,096
Team Asuma, Team Kurenai...

1076
01:09:57,735 --> 01:10:01,572
The main members from
that last time made it through.

1077
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:04,592
Yup! You all gave it your all!

1078
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:08,953
The fortitude you showed in running for
three days and three nights without sleep

1079
01:10:08,978 --> 01:10:11,406
has made me so proud!

1080
01:10:12,245 --> 01:10:15,468
Why, it takes me back to the time
I took the Chunin Exam...

1081
01:10:15,657 --> 01:10:17,993
Sensei... If you're going to
tell us a long story...

1082
01:10:18,068 --> 01:10:21,530
Please let us rest already.
I'm starving.

1083
01:10:23,394 --> 01:10:24,395
Seems like it.

1084
01:10:27,307 --> 01:10:29,685
We've never been to
the Hidden Sand before...

1085
01:10:30,517 --> 01:10:33,062
It really is nothing but desert.

1086
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:36,565
To be accurate,
this isn't the Hidden Sand Village.

1087
01:10:36,973 --> 01:10:39,309
It's quite far from the village.

1088
01:10:39,693 --> 01:10:42,796
Neji, have you ever been to
the Hidden Sand Village?

1089
01:10:43,392 --> 01:10:45,131
Once on an errand for the Hyuga.

1090
01:10:45,754 --> 01:10:47,964
This is the Demon Desert checkpoint.

1091
01:10:49,426 --> 01:10:50,635
I see.

1092
01:10:50,871 --> 01:10:52,665
So this is what they're using.

1093
01:10:52,933 --> 01:10:57,064
Taking the test in a different village
is sort of nerve-wracking.

1094
01:10:57,933 --> 01:11:01,061
I wonder what
the second test will be like.

1095
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:04,551
It's probably like last time.

1096
01:11:04,914 --> 01:11:07,625
So we'll be battling teams
from other villages?

1097
01:11:08,069 --> 01:11:09,403
There's a good chance of that.

1098
01:11:10,022 --> 01:11:13,317
Then we'll have to be wary
of some teams.

1099
01:11:14,872 --> 01:11:18,436
We went at full-speed,
yet we weren't the first to arrive.

1100
01:11:19,483 --> 01:11:21,485
The Hidden Waterfall team was
the first to arrive.

1101
01:11:22,395 --> 01:11:25,506
Not only that,
they got here long before us.

1102
01:11:26,657 --> 01:11:28,826
Just what kind of opponents
are they?

1103
01:11:30,744 --> 01:11:33,622
C'mon, open up!

1104
01:11:33,826 --> 01:11:37,496
What's going on?
The door won't open!

1105
01:11:37,521 --> 01:11:38,605
Sorry, Fuu.

1106
01:11:38,736 --> 01:11:41,322
Stay in there until morning.

1107
01:11:41,542 --> 01:11:44,087
Huh?! Why's that?

1108
01:11:44,591 --> 01:11:46,719
We never know what you'll do next.

1109
01:11:46,853 --> 01:11:50,853
So please, give us a break and
let us rest up for the next test.

1110
01:11:50,878 --> 01:11:52,838
Huh? Hey!

1111
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:55,394
That means I can't go and
have fun with the others!

1112
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:57,980
See, that's what worries us.

1113
01:12:01,997 --> 01:12:03,957
<i>Dinner is ready.</i>

1114
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:07,239
<i>Entrants, please assemble
in the cafeteria.</i>

1115
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:11,743
So that's Hidden Sand Village...

1116
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:17,082
Check out the Hidden Sand team...
giving everyone the stink eye.

1117
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:19,501
They sure look mean.

1118
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:23,375
Well, Kiba... You look pretty mean too.

1119
01:12:23,847 --> 01:12:26,016
And over there
are the Hidden Rain.

1120
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:29,511
I guess the other side
is the Hidden Grass.

1121
01:12:29,831 --> 01:12:31,875
That guy's amazing.

1122
01:12:32,097 --> 01:12:33,507
I'll say.

1123
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:37,574
Compared to him, even
our slightly chubby Choji looks normal.

1124
01:12:38,041 --> 01:12:40,001
But the way he sweats...

1125
01:12:40,375 --> 01:12:42,253
Seriously, that's gross.

1126
01:12:44,234 --> 01:12:45,277
Hey...

1127
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:47,571
I'm getting a bad feeling...

1128
01:12:48,793 --> 01:12:50,002
Bad feeling?

1129
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:51,492
All that sweat.

1130
01:12:52,107 --> 01:12:54,443
If he gets close to the food...

1131
01:13:00,501 --> 01:13:04,797
All right! Time to eat dinner!

1132
01:13:31,164 --> 01:13:32,319
At this rate...

1133
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:34,451
Our dinner will be...

1134
01:13:49,299 --> 01:13:50,342
Damn!

1135
01:13:53,555 --> 01:13:55,274
<i>Eight Trigrams Palm Rotation!</i>

1136
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:00,018
S-Saved...

1137
01:14:00,185 --> 01:14:02,688
Uh... I do not think so.

1138
01:14:10,868 --> 01:14:12,938
What did you do to our dinner?

1139
01:14:13,073 --> 01:14:14,427
What are you thinking?

1140
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:19,357
What did you do to our friend?!

1141
01:14:19,382 --> 01:14:20,364
Don't misunderstand!

1142
01:14:20,548 --> 01:14:24,215
We wanted to protect our food!

1143
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:28,870
So you were going to save your food
and never mind the rest of us, right?

1144
01:14:29,256 --> 01:14:30,507
What are you saying?!

1145
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:32,759
We'd never stoop to
something like that!

1146
01:14:33,104 --> 01:14:37,067
Your suspicion shows that
Gaara hasn't trained you right!

1147
01:14:37,683 --> 01:14:41,084
Did you just criticize Lord Gaara?

1148
01:14:41,437 --> 01:14:44,482
That is absolutely unforgivable!

1149
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:50,360
Stop!

1150
01:14:50,527 --> 01:14:53,572
Please stop, everyone!

1151
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:05,876
Hey, stop it!

1152
01:15:13,133 --> 01:15:15,385
Neji! Aren't you going to stop them?

1153
01:15:15,427 --> 01:15:17,054
Sorry, but I'm busy right now.

1154
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:18,478
Burami!

1155
01:15:19,097 --> 01:15:20,766
Don't eat food off the ground!

1156
01:15:21,141 --> 01:15:23,018
Muyami! You help too!

1157
01:15:23,393 --> 01:15:25,812
I'll pass... I'm too shy.

1158
01:15:26,434 --> 01:15:27,894
Calm down, every—!

1159
01:15:27,919 --> 01:15:29,337
Do not fight—!

1160
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:31,109
Why you...!

1161
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:40,452
Will you stop... and listen to me?!

1162
01:15:52,887 --> 01:15:56,575
This room is way too small for
a flashy move like that.

1163
01:15:57,151 --> 01:15:58,931
<i>I didn't do that at full strength,
but still...</i>

1164
01:15:58,956 --> 01:16:01,084
<i>To be able
to stop me with one hand...</i>

1165
01:16:02,266 --> 01:16:03,517
What's that sound?

1166
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:05,227
Fuu!

1167
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:14,528
Ta-dah!

1168
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:18,574
So the party's already started, guys?!

1169
01:16:18,852 --> 01:16:21,771
I wonder if I can make a hundred friends?

1170
01:16:22,413 --> 01:16:23,571
Wh-Who are you?

1171
01:16:24,635 --> 01:16:26,804
I'm Fuu from the Hidden Waterfall Village!

1172
01:16:29,897 --> 01:16:31,052
<i>This one...</i>

1173
01:16:31,077 --> 01:16:35,457
I came to the Chunin Exam
to make a hundred friends!

1174
01:16:35,981 --> 01:16:38,692
So guys, what's the plan
after dinner?

1175
01:16:38,847 --> 01:16:42,193
Cards? Backgammon? Musical chairs?

1176
01:16:42,422 --> 01:16:43,740
Or...

1177
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:46,936
How about we all take
a bath together?

1178
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:49,229
What's with you?

1179
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:54,693
Oh well, so much for dinner...

1180
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:56,361
I'm going back.

1181
01:16:56,737 --> 01:16:57,946
Huh? Hey...

1182
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:01,783
W-Wait!

1183
01:17:02,025 --> 01:17:03,568
Don't go!

1184
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:06,538
Hey guys, play with me!

1185
01:17:07,331 --> 01:17:08,373
Well...

1186
01:17:08,475 --> 01:17:11,603
It took an idiot like that
to stop the ruckus...

1187
01:17:12,002 --> 01:17:13,629
Sort of reminds me of someone.

1188
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:15,172
I know... Naruto.

1189
01:17:15,197 --> 01:17:16,574
Right, Lee?

1190
01:17:17,454 --> 01:17:18,571
Huh? Lee?

1191
01:17:19,134 --> 01:17:20,552
Excuse me, please wait!

1192
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:24,681
I realized it when
I made contact earlier.

1193
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:27,142
You are not like the others.

1194
01:17:29,594 --> 01:17:32,389
You stopped my attack
with such ease.

1195
01:17:33,291 --> 01:17:35,135
It may sound arrogant
coming from me,

1196
01:17:35,404 --> 01:17:38,407
but it takes someone
extraordinary to do that.

1197
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:40,530
That's why I can tell...

1198
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:43,950
That you have had to overcome
great odds like me.

1199
01:17:44,743 --> 01:17:45,911
What are you trying to say?

1200
01:17:46,411 --> 01:17:49,039
Well... that you and I are alike.

1201
01:17:49,388 --> 01:17:50,806
I know about you.

1202
01:17:52,853 --> 01:17:54,438
You're Rock Lee of the Hidden Leaf.

1203
01:17:55,489 --> 01:17:57,089
I'm Shira of the Hidden Sand.

1204
01:17:58,340 --> 01:17:59,508
Shira...

1205
01:18:01,116 --> 01:18:03,241
I don't know what it is you sensed,

1206
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:06,512
but dwelling on the misfortunes
of birth is meaningless.

1207
01:18:07,474 --> 01:18:09,101
Because, for all of one's flaws
and suffering,

1208
01:18:09,142 --> 01:18:11,436
we have just one life.

1209
01:18:12,312 --> 01:18:15,440
To me, there is only one truth in life.

1210
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:17,567
One truth in life?

1211
01:18:21,981 --> 01:18:23,990
Determination never betrays you.

1212
01:18:30,038 --> 01:18:31,039
Shira...

1213
01:18:32,786 --> 01:18:35,205
Lady Tsunade, I've returned.

1214
01:18:35,395 --> 01:18:38,023
I'm glad you made it back.
So how did it go?

1215
01:18:38,463 --> 01:18:42,134
As I reported, I wasn't able
to see Hanzo in person.

1216
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:46,847
I intended to sneak back in and

1217
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:48,849
investigate, but...

1218
01:19:00,781 --> 01:19:02,824
The infiltrator must be around here!

1219
01:19:03,113 --> 01:19:04,364
Find him!

1220
01:19:04,531 --> 01:19:05,699
<i>What?</i>

1221
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:07,409
<i>They've discovered
my presence already?</i>

1222
01:19:09,035 --> 01:19:11,621
They were on to me from the start.

1223
01:19:12,169 --> 01:19:13,754
It was almost as though...

1224
01:19:14,207 --> 01:19:15,667
ghosts were watching me.

1225
01:19:15,792 --> 01:19:17,210
Well...

1226
01:19:19,894 --> 01:19:22,424
I was expecting just
the usual Chunin Exam,

1227
01:19:23,442 --> 01:19:25,444
But now that it's started,

1228
01:19:25,469 --> 01:19:28,555
we're discovering some
interesting things about each village.

1229
01:19:28,889 --> 01:19:30,474
Interesting things?

1230
01:19:44,155 --> 01:19:45,282
Choji...

1231
01:19:46,047 --> 01:19:47,069
What are you doing?

1232
01:19:47,741 --> 01:19:48,635
Ino...

1233
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:51,231
What's that building?

1234
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:54,713
Oh, that's where the Senseis
are staying.

1235
01:19:54,915 --> 01:19:56,291
The Senseis?!

1236
01:19:57,887 --> 01:19:59,878
Hey, Choji!

1237
01:19:59,903 --> 01:20:02,906
I'll bet they'll give us some food
if we go there!

1238
01:20:03,223 --> 01:20:05,392
We're not supposed to
wander around at night!

1239
01:20:05,864 --> 01:20:08,617
He's so hungry,
he can't think straight!

1240
01:20:08,968 --> 01:20:10,083
Let's go after him!

1241
01:20:19,272 --> 01:20:22,150
Choji! Where are you?!

1242
01:20:24,932 --> 01:20:26,029
– Choji?!
– Choji?!

1243
01:20:28,782 --> 01:20:30,125
Friends...

1244
01:20:33,826 --> 01:20:34,709
<i>Byakugan!</i>

1245
01:20:37,457 --> 01:20:39,042
What is that shadow?

1246
01:20:39,281 --> 01:20:40,407
Whose voice was that?!

1247
01:20:40,799 --> 01:20:41,925
No way...

1248
01:20:42,087 --> 01:20:43,797
Did someone go outside?

1249
01:20:43,964 --> 01:20:45,048
What?

1250
01:20:45,073 --> 01:20:47,325
Oh! Cards? Backgammon?!

1251
01:20:48,138 --> 01:20:51,767
Giant scorpions come out at night
during this time of year!

1252
01:20:52,042 --> 01:20:53,835
That's why you were told
not to go outside!

1253
01:20:54,438 --> 01:20:56,552
You have things like that?!

1254
01:20:57,633 --> 01:20:58,675
Hey!

1255
01:21:08,304 --> 01:21:09,246
Choji!

1256
01:21:09,532 --> 01:21:10,701
I'm here to help you!

1257
01:21:12,285 --> 01:21:13,286
What is this thing?!

1258
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:20,834
<i>Hidden Waterfall Hurricane!</i>

1259
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:32,178
Yahoo! This is fun!

1260
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:34,556
No! Stop!

1261
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:36,294
Wh-What's happening?!

1262
01:21:36,319 --> 01:21:37,362
Hey!

1263
01:21:37,387 --> 01:21:40,264
Stop fooling around,
and take that thing down!

1264
01:21:40,564 --> 01:21:42,900
Huh? It's over already...?!

1265
01:21:43,189 --> 01:21:44,691
It's dangerous!

1266
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:48,987
Aww... Guess I have no choice!

1267
01:21:58,067 --> 01:22:00,194
Sakura, are you all right?

1268
01:22:00,999 --> 01:22:01,833
Yeah...

1269
01:22:03,039 --> 01:22:04,499
But you're bleeding!

1270
01:22:04,711 --> 01:22:06,087
I'm okay.

1271
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,214
Please don't move.

1272
01:22:12,412 --> 01:22:13,413
<i>This girl...</i>

1273
01:22:14,233 --> 01:22:16,277
<i>She's a Medical Ninja like me...</i>

1274
01:22:17,682 --> 01:22:18,892
That should do it.

1275
01:22:19,336 --> 01:22:20,147
Thank you.

1276
01:22:23,156 --> 01:22:24,324
<i>She's got skill.</i>

1277
01:22:25,346 --> 01:22:26,305
Yahoo!

1278
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:29,778
Yahoo yahoo-hoo!

1279
01:22:29,819 --> 01:22:30,862
Honestly...

1280
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:32,530
What a pain...

1281
01:22:32,530 --> 01:22:34,366
<i>Her again...</i>

1282
01:22:34,824 --> 01:22:37,035
<i>How'd she show up so fast?</i>

1283
01:22:37,340 --> 01:22:40,760
<i>And she brought down
that monster in no time.</i>

1284
01:22:40,849 --> 01:22:42,767
Wh-What is this?!

1285
01:22:45,095 --> 01:22:46,680
What's going on?

1286
01:22:47,014 --> 01:22:49,308
Going outside at night is prohibited.

1287
01:22:49,673 --> 01:22:51,883
The second test begins before dawn!

1288
01:22:52,190 --> 01:22:53,691
Hurry up and return
to your quarters!

1289
01:22:54,552 --> 01:22:56,305
– We're sorry.
– Guy-sensei!

1290
01:22:56,596 --> 01:22:59,214
W-We're starving!

1291
01:22:59,343 --> 01:23:01,554
You guys are...

1292
01:23:02,477 --> 01:23:04,437
Go back now!

1293
01:23:05,158 --> 01:23:08,412
Clear your mind of mundane thoughts
and even a fire will go out!

1294
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,739
Missing one meal won't kill a person!

1295
01:23:14,888 --> 01:23:16,681
Just think of this
as part of training!

1296
01:23:21,813 --> 01:23:23,095
Huh? Huh?

1297
01:23:23,402 --> 01:23:26,447
Huh?! You're all leaving?

1298
01:23:26,847 --> 01:23:28,165
I'm so sad...

1299
01:23:28,965 --> 01:23:34,095
You're a good person...
helping foes from other villages.

1300
01:23:34,801 --> 01:23:37,721
If you had ignored them, you would've
ended up with fewer rivals.

1301
01:23:37,958 --> 01:23:41,337
I don't care about rivals or allies.

1302
01:23:42,161 --> 01:23:44,873
I wonder if I'm going to make
a hundred friends!

1303
01:23:45,007 --> 01:23:48,636
Hey, let's be friends!

1304
01:23:48,745 --> 01:23:50,747
Want to play cards? Backgammon?

1305
01:23:51,651 --> 01:23:54,996
Or... want to bathe together?!

1306
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:59,951
That is the Lord Kazekage
and the Jonin supervisors!

1307
01:24:00,163 --> 01:24:01,790
Watch what you say!

1308
01:24:01,995 --> 01:24:04,831
One hundred...!

1309
01:24:05,079 --> 01:24:06,830
– Enough! Let's go back!
– ... friends!

1310
01:24:07,038 --> 01:24:09,582
Doesn't care about rivals or allies, huh.

1311
01:24:10,587 --> 01:24:13,339
Sounds just like someone I know.

1312
01:24:13,631 --> 01:24:14,716
Gaara?

1313
01:24:15,133 --> 01:24:16,134
It's nothing.

1314
01:24:17,135 --> 01:24:21,639
Now I have more to look forward to
in the Chunin Exam.

1315
01:24:21,681 --> 01:24:25,143
Thanks to a few interesting
characters taking part in it.

1316
01:24:33,193 --> 01:24:34,557
All right...

1317
01:24:34,850 --> 01:24:37,353
I'm going to explain the second test
of the Chunin Exam.

1318
01:24:37,847 --> 01:24:40,725
The second test will be
a competition for scrolls

1319
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:42,168
to be held in the Demon Desert.

1320
01:24:42,772 --> 01:24:45,901
In other words,
this is the ultimate survival battle!

1321
01:24:48,218 --> 01:24:51,596
There are two scrolls,
Heaven and Earth.

1322
01:24:52,299 --> 01:24:54,546
Half the teams will be
given Heaven scrolls.

1323
01:24:54,621 --> 01:24:57,624
The other half will get Earth scrolls.

1324
01:24:58,192 --> 01:25:00,028
The objective of this test

1325
01:25:00,136 --> 01:25:03,139
is to obtain both the Heaven
and Earth scrolls

1326
01:25:03,181 --> 01:25:05,058
and to bring them back
to the base

1327
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:06,726
located in the center of the Demon Desert.

1328
01:25:06,893 --> 01:25:08,520
You have 72 hours.

1329
01:25:08,561 --> 01:25:10,271
Find food on your own!

1330
01:25:11,689 --> 01:25:13,733
Starting now, there may be fatalities.

1331
01:25:14,114 --> 01:25:18,088
Every participating team member
will sign a consent form!

1332
01:25:18,299 --> 01:25:22,261
When you turn in the team consent forms,
you will be given a scroll!

1333
01:25:22,367 --> 01:25:25,203
Furthermore, to avoid confusion,

1334
01:25:25,698 --> 01:25:28,909
each team will start from
a different location.

1335
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:32,627
So be quick,
and go to your starting points!

1336
01:25:34,045 --> 01:25:35,797
It's finally starting...

1337
01:25:36,089 --> 01:25:38,049
The second test of the Chunin Exam!

1338
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:41,235
We don't know what lies ahead.

1339
01:25:41,260 --> 01:25:43,053
So let's stay on our toes.

1340
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:44,139
– Right!
– Okay!
