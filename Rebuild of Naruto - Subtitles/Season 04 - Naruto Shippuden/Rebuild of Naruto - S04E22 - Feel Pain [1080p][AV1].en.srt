1
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:21,438
From here on, we'll be splitting
into two teams: diversion and search.

2
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:22,939
I'll go over it again.

3
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:27,652
Diversion will be made up
of Shurado, Chikushodo, and Gakido.

4
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:32,782
Search will be Tendo,
Ningendo, and Jigokudo.

5
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:36,453
Konan, you're with the search team.

6
00:00:37,186 --> 00:00:38,187
I know.

7
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,391
The Hidden Leaf Village...

8
00:00:46,492 --> 00:00:48,828
is surrounded by
a spherical barrier that

9
00:00:48,975 --> 00:00:51,269
includes underground
and aerial coverage.

10
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,615
Which means anyone
who enters without permission

11
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,893
is detected immediately.

12
00:00:57,842 --> 00:01:01,482
As planned, we will launch Chikushodo
into the Hidden Leaf's airspace.

13
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,984
We will confuse the enemy
regarding our numbers.

14
00:01:06,535 --> 00:01:08,996
Wait for Chikushodo's summoning.

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,782
I was told Itachi and Kisame
infiltrated easily.

16
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,660
Itachi once belonged to
the Leaf's ANBU Black Ops.

17
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,413
He knew the password
to get through the barrier.

18
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,541
I have my own way of doing things.

19
00:01:26,606 --> 00:01:29,067
Starting here,
the world shall know pain...

20
00:01:37,199 --> 00:01:38,575
An intruder!

21
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,811
Single target, west gate, sector I-B

22
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:48,166
Hurry, hurry!

23
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,317
Yes, I'm coming dear.

24
00:02:01,304 --> 00:02:02,722
Thanks for the food!

25
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:03,957
Yes, thank you!

26
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,380
Disperse!

27
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,067
What is that?

28
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,206
<i>Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!</i>

29
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,504
My Fire Style has no effect!

30
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,141
They're everywhere! What's going on?!

31
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,351
I thought there was just one intruder!

32
00:03:05,703 --> 00:03:07,538
I'll confirm with the Byakugan
right away!

33
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,065
This is beyond the scope
of just the Barrier Corps!

34
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:14,777
Contact other troops and
request backup! Hurry!

35
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:15,653
Right!

36
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,530
I'll go notify Lady Hokage!

37
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:30,084
He holds no information
on the Nine-Tails.

38
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:43,899
Where is Naruto Uzumaki?

39
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,363
He doesn't know either...

40
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:22,262
The chakra transmission shot up suddenly
and the black rod began warming up,

41
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:23,721
so I thought it was strange.

42
00:04:24,021 --> 00:04:27,983
These are demodulators for
receiving high frequency chakra waves.

43
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,688
Demodulator?
Which means what?

44
00:04:32,297 --> 00:04:35,091
In other words,
they're chakra receivers!

45
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,443
And, it's receiving
at this very moment!

46
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:40,253
Receiver? What do you mean?

47
00:04:40,775 --> 00:04:42,985
If this is a receiver...

48
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:45,434
I don't have time to explain.

49
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:47,169
I have to notify Lady Tsunade
immediately...

50
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,708
What was that?

51
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,094
What's that?

52
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,137
Let's go!

53
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:39,313
Found it!

54
00:05:58,238 --> 00:05:59,281
What was that?

55
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,453
Choji! I'll notify the Intel Division.

56
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,579
Right!

57
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:16,042
<i>I have to get to Pa!</i>

58
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,884
Father! The village is...

59
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,560
Run!

60
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,855
Tami!

61
00:06:53,193 --> 00:06:54,862
Cha!

62
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,901
Are you all right?!

63
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,090
U-Uh-huh.

64
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,426
Th-Thank you so much!

65
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,515
The centipede is down...

66
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,058
Seems that girl did it.

67
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,816
Thank goodness!
Your wound is not too deep.

68
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,484
Thank you...

69
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,486
Sakura!

70
00:07:27,607 --> 00:07:28,692
Are you all right?

71
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:29,991
Iruka-sensei...

72
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:32,144
Just what's going on?

73
00:07:32,617 --> 00:07:33,636
I don't know.

74
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,456
But someone is attacking
the Leaf Village!

75
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,960
The situation has been
reported to Lady Tsunade.

76
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,521
The alarm should sound soon.

77
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,716
The village is under direct attack?

78
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,343
Who would do such a thing?

79
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,306
Let's go, Iruka!

80
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,515
Right!

81
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:58,853
Sakura, hurry to the hospital
and tend to the wounded.

82
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,022
It's full of injured people.

83
00:08:01,246 --> 00:08:02,247
Yes, sir!

84
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,534
Barrier Corps reporting!

85
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:17,079
An intruder entered Hidden
Leaf Village through our airspace.

86
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,290
Our sensors picked up
a single target.

87
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:23,503
But shortly after detection,
several attacks were confirmed.

88
00:08:24,716 --> 00:08:26,217
Analysis Corps reporting!

89
00:08:26,586 --> 00:08:29,005
Enemy strength estimated
as three battalions in size!

90
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:35,848
<i>A foe capable of organizing
this much military power unnoticed...</i>

91
00:08:36,564 --> 00:08:37,690
<i>It must be...</i>

92
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:41,229
Reporting! I have a witness report
on the intruder!

93
00:08:41,361 --> 00:08:43,237
He wore black with
a red cloud pattern.

94
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,652
<i>The Akatsuki...
So they've finally come.</i>

95
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,531
Sound the state of emergency alarm.

96
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,199
And...

97
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,369
Recall Naruto!

98
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:34,884
What is all this ruckus?!

99
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,348
The Akatsuki have begun their assault.

100
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,517
Then... their target is...

101
00:10:43,972 --> 00:10:47,705
The Fourth Hokage's legacy...
Naruto Uzumaki!

102
00:10:49,771 --> 00:10:51,944
And yet, despite the danger,

103
00:10:52,283 --> 00:10:55,453
the Fifth Hokage is trying
to summon Naruto back.

104
00:10:56,155 --> 00:11:00,826
Such a thing...
is like pouring oil onto a fire!

105
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:05,538
Yes... If we keep listening
to the Fifth Hokage...

106
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:08,105
the Hidden Leaf will be destroyed!

107
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:19,804
What was that?!

108
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,043
Stop! You mustn't go outside!

109
00:11:22,463 --> 00:11:24,590
Shikamaru! What's going on?!

110
00:11:25,138 --> 00:11:26,931
The Akatsuki has entered our territory.

111
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:47,289
Kurenai-sensei, can you step back?

112
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:30,332
All right.
I will return to call Naruto back.

113
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,084
I'm counting on you!

114
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,545
Stop!

115
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,631
Leave Naruto on Mount Myoboku.

116
00:12:37,872 --> 00:12:38,957
What?!

117
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:43,721
We know that the Akatsuki leader
is the one attacking the village.

118
00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:45,484
How did you find out?

119
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,683
We heard it from Danzo.

120
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:52,229
Moreover, they are after
Naruto's Jinchuriki power.

121
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,197
So what of it?

122
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,984
The last time, we gave you
the benefit of the doubt.

123
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,569
But not this time.

124
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,197
Naruto is still a child.

125
00:13:01,813 --> 00:13:04,914
This is the assailant who
brought Jiraiya down!

126
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:09,413
If Naruto is taken and
the Nine-Tails falls into their hands...

127
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,290
Wha—?! What are you doing?!

128
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:16,207
<i>Until I become Hokage...</i>

129
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,922
<i>I'll...</i>

130
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,010
<i>never die!</i>

131
00:13:23,228 --> 00:13:25,731
<i>I will avenge Pervy Sage!</i>

132
00:13:26,017 --> 00:13:28,436
<i>I can't just sit around doing nothing!</i>

133
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,020
<i>However... I guess I shouldn't
wallow in sadness.</i>

134
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,065
<i>My duty is to be a model
for the next generation</i>

135
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,675
<i>and to help them out.</i>

136
00:13:39,301 --> 00:13:41,970
<i>For that, I'd happily give my life.</i>

137
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:48,160
<i>I can see that child truly loved
and admired Jiraiya-boy.</i>

138
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,331
Y-You... Unhand us, Tsunade!

139
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,794
How dare you raise your hand
against us counselors...

140
00:13:57,126 --> 00:13:59,003
Who do you think you are?!

141
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,174
How long do you intend to
treat him like a child?

142
00:14:02,422 --> 00:14:03,301
What?!

143
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,678
The will of the Hidden Leaf
has been passed on

144
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,846
and it's growing!

145
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:10,474
Naruto is striving to surpass
Jiraiya this very minute!

146
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,143
He's not a hidden weapon

147
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,229
to be used by the Hidden Leaf
as a deterrent to war!

148
00:14:16,859 --> 00:14:19,458
He is a ninja who has sworn
to protect the Hidden Leaf...

149
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,835
He is Naruto Uzumaki!

150
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,906
What Sarutobi-sensei and
Lady Chiyo of the Sand had...

151
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,242
and what you two lack... is this!

152
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,247
The power to believe!

153
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:52,141
In the same way that
my grandfather, the First Hokage,

154
00:14:52,714 --> 00:14:55,210
believed in you and entrusted
the Hidden Leaf to your care...

155
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:06,176
It is time for you to believe,
and entrust to the next generation!

156
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,133
Do as you please.

157
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,143
Lady Tsunade!

158
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,645
Did you learn anything?

159
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,755
Yes!

160
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,940
This here!

161
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,524
What is it?

162
00:15:42,813 --> 00:15:46,441
It seems to be a receiver
for chakra signals.

163
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,699
Pain's corpse had these inserted
throughout his body.

164
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,159
A receiver?!

165
00:15:52,539 --> 00:15:54,707
According to what
Lord Fukasaku said,

166
00:15:54,870 --> 00:16:00,834
all six Pains had these stuck
in their bodies and faces.

167
00:16:01,258 --> 00:16:03,219
Does this mean that
the six Pains receive

168
00:16:03,244 --> 00:16:08,458
some kind of chakra signal through
their bodies, and then take action?

169
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,095
That part isn't clear yet.

170
00:16:11,445 --> 00:16:15,866
A receiver... Or they use it
to transmit chakra to each other.

171
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,393
Something wireless...

172
00:16:17,565 --> 00:16:20,359
Also, this has definitely been activated.

173
00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:24,481
This must be connected to
the secret of Pain's strength.

174
00:16:25,265 --> 00:16:27,354
Together with the data
the Interrogation Corps gathers,

175
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:28,547
we'll figure this out.

176
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:33,492
According to the Intel Division,
the enemy is looking for Naruto.

177
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:37,505
This enemy, who infiltrated the village,
is undoubtedly Pain.

178
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:41,339
Messenger frog!
When you go to summon Naruto,

179
00:16:41,364 --> 00:16:42,616
relay this message as well.

180
00:16:42,975 --> 00:16:43,976
Understood!

181
00:16:44,659 --> 00:16:46,786
Shizune, take the data
from the autopsy,

182
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:50,300
collaborate with Interrogation Corps
and figure out just who Pain is!

183
00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:50,954
Yes, ma'am!

184
00:16:51,464 --> 00:16:54,091
ANBU Team B will provide
Shizune with a protective escort!

185
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,724
Then, guard the Interrogation Corps!

186
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,475
Do not allow the enemy
to get near them!

187
00:16:58,475 --> 00:16:59,476
Yes, ma'am!

188
00:16:59,604 --> 00:17:01,898
I will wait for further news
on the rooftop,

189
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,773
and I will provide treatment for
all the wounded through Katsuyu.

190
00:17:05,094 --> 00:17:06,763
I will use all my power to
protect the village!

191
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,051
Let's go!

192
00:17:12,043 --> 00:17:15,589
Right! I must rush to Lord Fukasaku too!

193
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:26,378
They are so useless.
All they've done is grow old...

194
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:30,049
So Tsunade persuaded them
to her side instead...

195
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,636
But now, the Nine-Tails
can be kept caged up.

196
00:17:50,883 --> 00:17:52,510
I'll ask you once more.

197
00:17:52,564 --> 00:17:54,274
Where is Naruto Uzumaki?

198
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,785
Go to hell!

199
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:11,757
Speak. Is Naruto Uzumaki
in this village or not?

200
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,134
Which is it?

201
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,929
I-I don't know...

202
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,234
This guy... He absorbed the jutsu!

203
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,736
Then we'll have to engage
in direct combat.

204
00:18:55,338 --> 00:18:57,090
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

205
00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:08,871
Starting now, attach yourself
to every ninja and citizen

206
00:19:08,934 --> 00:19:10,685
in the Hidden Leaf Village.

207
00:19:10,907 --> 00:19:14,703
Take in my chakra and use it
to treat all their injuries!

208
00:19:15,198 --> 00:19:17,450
<i>It seems the village is in dire straits.</i>

209
00:19:17,664 --> 00:19:19,165
Never mind, just go.

210
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,781
<i>I understand.</i>

211
00:19:43,637 --> 00:19:46,515
I will protect this village,
no matter what happens!

212
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,832
I swear upon my title of Hokage!

213
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,581
Are you all right?

214
00:20:09,699 --> 00:20:12,786
Tell me where the Jinchuriki
of the Nine-Tails is...

215
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,464
Or else, I'll kill you.

216
00:20:17,321 --> 00:20:18,614
<i>This crest...</i>

217
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:22,398
<i>I see... So he's from the Akatsuki.</i>

218
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,759
Speak up.

219
00:20:27,444 --> 00:20:28,445
<i>Naruto...</i>

220
00:20:29,982 --> 00:20:32,777
I have no intention of telling
you anything!

221
00:20:33,444 --> 00:20:36,280
I see... Then I have no use for you.

222
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,039
You created a loud diversion,

223
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,041
so that you can investigate
from the shadows...

224
00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:52,253
Kakashi!

225
00:20:52,964 --> 00:20:54,715
Get the wounded to safety.

226
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,381
Leave this scene to me.

227
00:20:58,674 --> 00:20:59,633
Roger!

228
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,723
<i>Good luck, Kakashi!</i>

229
00:21:12,265 --> 00:21:13,642
Now it's just the two of us.

230
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:18,485
Then I'll ask you.
Where is the Nine-Tails?

231
00:21:18,933 --> 00:21:22,145
What you're doing is totally pointless.

232
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:27,286
The people of this village are
different from your average village.

233
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,626
Even if it means dying,

234
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:39,256
there's not a single
one of us who would

235
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,300
sell out a comrade.

236
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,858
<i>Earth Style: Mud Wall!</i>

237
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,036
<i>Lightning Blade!</i>

238
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,751
<i>What was that?!</i>

239
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:18,595
the Copy Ninja, Kakashi Hatake...

240
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,172
I'm honored to meet you.

241
00:22:24,181 --> 00:22:25,515
Where is the Nine-Tails?

242
00:22:25,817 --> 00:22:27,735
That... is a silly question.

243
00:22:41,479 --> 00:22:42,480
Over there!

244
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,489
Pa!

245
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:48,658
I'm coming too!

246
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,417
<i>What was that jutsu just now?</i>

247
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:00,252
<i>It felt different from a shock wave...</i>

248
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:04,216
<i>Everything around him was blasted
away, with him as the epicenter.</i>

249
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,137
<i>Then...</i>

250
00:23:10,162 --> 00:23:11,539
<i>How will you counter this?</i>

251
00:23:21,204 --> 00:23:22,497
<i>Not just physical attacks...</i>

252
00:23:22,522 --> 00:23:24,441
<i>He can repel ninjutsu as well?!</i>

253
00:23:24,857 --> 00:23:26,192
<i>Impressive.</i>

254
00:23:27,188 --> 00:23:29,274
<i>Now then, how should I...?</i>

255
00:23:31,961 --> 00:23:32,962
<i>Another one?</i>

256
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:49,302
<i>You're mine!</i>

257
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,014
<i>This guy...
He was facing directly ahead, yet...</i>

258
00:24:01,895 --> 00:24:05,231
<i>Lord Jiraiya took on
six of them at once?!</i>

259
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,988
<i>I must say... That's crazy...</i>

260
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,763
<i>I get it! That's his ability!</i>

261
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:41,229
<i>Pain...</i>

262
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,107
<i>I have no chance
if I fight them alone.</i>

263
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,735
<i>I must call for reinforcements,</i>

264
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,971
<i>and let them know
what this one's ability is!</i>

265
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:51,781
<i>I have to do as much as
my body can handle!</i>

266
00:25:03,413 --> 00:25:04,998
<i>A Lightning Style Shadow Clone!</i>

267
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:21,132
One down...

268
00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:23,469
Kakashi?

269
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,152
Actually, I was all set too.

270
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:31,260
But this will help me preserve
some chakra.

271
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,073
Thank you.

272
00:25:33,554 --> 00:25:34,680
Are you all right?

273
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:36,952
Yes... Well... I'll manage.

274
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:39,204
Do you have enough chakra?

275
00:25:39,374 --> 00:25:42,043
I've already used my Lightning Style
Shadow Clone

276
00:25:42,104 --> 00:25:44,106
and exhausted over
half my chakra.

277
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,337
To be honest, a drawn-out battle against
a formidable opponent like him

278
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,630
is going to be difficult for me.

279
00:25:49,876 --> 00:25:53,379
However, I've figured out
a little of his abilities.

280
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,932
Pa, he's coming!

281
00:26:25,602 --> 00:26:27,395
<i>Almighty Push...</i>

282
00:26:32,398 --> 00:26:33,399
There!

283
00:26:39,852 --> 00:26:40,853
<i>That's...</i>

284
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,658
What did he just do?

285
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,843
He repelled all our attacks.

286
00:27:01,634 --> 00:27:03,970
Using himself as the epicenter,

287
00:27:03,995 --> 00:27:07,164
his jutsu allows him to attract
or repel objects.

288
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:10,795
Similar to the magnetic laws
of attraction and repulsion...

289
00:27:11,169 --> 00:27:14,422
However, it seems he cannot
utilize that jutsu consecutively.

290
00:27:14,736 --> 00:27:17,015
I know for certain that
there is an interval of time

291
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,043
before he can activate
the next jutsu.

292
00:27:27,718 --> 00:27:29,804
Everyone else has been taken down!

293
00:27:30,197 --> 00:27:33,575
If he can repel all attacks,
how do we defeat him?

294
00:27:34,062 --> 00:27:36,690
The interval between jutsu
seems short too.

295
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,406
We can't get close.

296
00:27:38,829 --> 00:27:41,457
However, that's our only chance.

297
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,412
I have an idea.

298
00:27:45,604 --> 00:27:46,814
And I need your help.

299
00:27:58,225 --> 00:28:00,394
You move quite well...

300
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,138
And you have a wide range of jutsu.

301
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:08,144
People like you need to be killed,
or you may pose a problem later.

302
00:28:10,475 --> 00:28:11,476
<i>Now!</i>

303
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,483
<i>Double Human...</i>

304
00:28:13,508 --> 00:28:14,509
<i>Boulder!</i>

305
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:18,697
Too slow...

306
00:28:36,709 --> 00:28:39,545
<i>The other Pain!
He could still move?!</i>

307
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,098
<i>Make it in time!</i>

308
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,109
<i>The damage is devastating...</i>

309
00:29:06,809 --> 00:29:07,810
No...

310
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:09,539
Everyone, let us hurry!

311
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,716
- Yes!
- Let us hurry. Let us hurry.

312
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:12,792
Now, hurry.

313
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:35,482
Your inability to move...
doesn't seem faked.

314
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:40,361
<i>I didn't make it...</i>

315
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:48,328
I know that you're not
a Shadow Clone.

316
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,997
I shall make certain of your death...

317
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,625
But just to be safe...

318
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,543
I will not approach you.

319
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,929
Humph... Know pain.

320
00:30:38,354 --> 00:30:39,355
Pa...

321
00:30:41,169 --> 00:30:42,503
Kakashi-sensei!

322
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:46,678
Pa...

323
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,807
You tried to protect me...

324
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:54,143
Save your tears for later... Choji.

325
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:57,645
If... you are able to move...

326
00:30:57,914 --> 00:31:01,000
report to Lady Tsunade
about Pain's abilities.

327
00:31:01,467 --> 00:31:03,260
A counter strategy is imperative!

328
00:31:04,202 --> 00:31:06,701
K-Kakashi... Sensei?

329
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:08,199
Reflect later!

330
00:31:08,551 --> 00:31:10,094
You must... hurry!

331
00:31:10,471 --> 00:31:11,472
Run!

332
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:14,737
But... I... I...

333
00:31:15,147 --> 00:31:17,107
Don't let Choza's sacrifice
be in vain!

334
00:31:21,597 --> 00:31:23,265
Persistent fellows, aren't you?

335
00:31:23,617 --> 00:31:25,160
<i>Damn it... He's still...!</i>

336
00:31:33,379 --> 00:31:34,505
<i>He's after Choji!</i>

337
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:41,983
Pa... Thank you for everything
you've done.

338
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,527
Just you watch!

339
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,156
Run! Choji!

340
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,750
<i>I daresay with the chakra I have left</i>

341
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:01,138
<i>it's impossible to destroy
his entire body.</i>

342
00:32:01,644 --> 00:32:03,767
<i>And... if I use it one more time,</i>

343
00:32:03,792 --> 00:32:06,461
<i>I'll exhaust all my stamina
and chakra.</i>

344
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:08,885
<i>My life will be...</i>

345
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:22,482
<i>To entrust this intel to the living.</i>

346
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:28,020
<i>This is the best method I have
right now to save the Hidden Leaf!</i>

347
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:43,753
<i>I get it...</i>

348
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:06,359
<i>So... he also... got by...
with that ocular jutsu...</i>

349
00:33:12,806 --> 00:33:17,936
<i>Well... it seems this is it
for me, too.</i>

350
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,093
<i>Obito... Rin...</i>

351
00:33:34,289 --> 00:33:36,958
Whatever the village may say...

352
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,309
You are a great Jonin.

353
00:33:41,308 --> 00:33:43,059
I'm about to die...

354
00:33:43,362 --> 00:33:49,368
But... I'll become your eyes
and see the future for you.

355
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:53,114
Take care of Rin...

356
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:56,617
Obito...

357
00:34:01,675 --> 00:34:03,635
It seems this is the end...

358
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:06,871
of me seeing the future as your eyes.

359
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,594
I wasn't able to protect Rin...

360
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,847
I keep breaking my promises
to you.

361
00:34:19,068 --> 00:34:20,069
Forgive me.

362
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:26,247
Obito...
Rin... Sensei...

363
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:39,285
I'll... be joining you now.

364
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,045
Is that you, Kakashi?

365
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,548
So this is where you were...

366
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,181
Will you tell me your story?

367
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:05,154
Sure... It's a really long story,
so I want to take my time.

368
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:09,398
Yeah... that's fine.

369
00:35:11,757 --> 00:35:14,176
Well... Father...

370
00:35:17,173 --> 00:35:18,383
Is something wrong?

371
00:35:25,836 --> 00:35:26,837
Lady Tsunade!

372
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,300
U-Um...

373
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,886
Katsuyu has already attached herself

374
00:35:38,911 --> 00:35:41,247
to most of the people
of the village.

375
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,779
Sorry. Let us continue...

376
00:35:57,955 --> 00:35:59,164
Lady Tsunade!

377
00:36:03,756 --> 00:36:06,008
We cracked the ability of
one of our enemies!

378
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,037
Tell me.

379
00:36:08,731 --> 00:36:13,152
He is male.
Between 25-30 years of age.

380
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,464
Distinguishing marks
are piercings,

381
00:36:15,586 --> 00:36:17,672
six in his nose and seven
in his ears.

382
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:21,721
His ability is a jutsu that simulates
magnetic attraction and repulsion.

383
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:25,183
He can attract targeted objects
to himself.

384
00:36:25,382 --> 00:36:29,136
And he can repel
every ninjutsu attack.

385
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,564
Repel?! All of them?

386
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:39,738
Yes! However, once he uses either
jutsu, there is a five-second interval.

387
00:36:40,577 --> 00:36:42,329
Five seconds... That's all?

388
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,620
You did well to report this!

389
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:47,538
Our casualties will decrease significantly.

390
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:51,667
Pass on this information to
everyone via Katsuyu!

391
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:52,586
- Yes, ma'am!
- Yes, ma'am!

392
00:36:52,611 --> 00:36:55,656
Team Choza provided back-up
for Kakashi-sensei

393
00:36:56,193 --> 00:36:58,362
against two of the enemies...

394
00:36:58,387 --> 00:37:01,307
It is believed everyone
except myself perished.

395
00:37:07,397 --> 00:37:08,817
Go back to Choza!

396
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,240
Take him to the hospital
immediately!

397
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,689
He can still be saved.

398
00:37:14,151 --> 00:37:15,152
Huh?!

399
00:37:17,044 --> 00:37:18,754
Then... Pa is...

400
00:37:19,092 --> 00:37:20,093
Yes...

401
00:37:26,226 --> 00:37:30,397
Thank goodness! I'm so glad!

402
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:36,212
Kakashi...

403
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,755
What about Kakashi-sensei?!

404
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:49,767
This spells the end of Tsunade's era.

405
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:54,553
However, we cannot allow
the Akatsuki to take Nine-Tails.

406
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:57,024
So I have eliminated that possibility.

407
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:01,904
We will remain underground
until the chaos subsides.

408
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,490
Shouldn't we be assisting?

409
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:07,682
Even if you should assume power,
it would be meaningless

410
00:38:07,707 --> 00:38:10,371
if the citizens of
the Hidden Leaf are dead.

411
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,499
The princess is now Hokage.

412
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:16,102
As long as she can utilize
Katsuyu's jutsu,

413
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,503
the entire village will not perish.

414
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,464
Certainly, there will be lives lost.

415
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,634
But to me, that is a necessary sacrifice.

416
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,971
In order for me to become the Hokage...

417
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,242
<i>I win!</i>

418
00:38:55,138 --> 00:38:57,891
<i>Nothing tastes better than
a drink of sake after work.</i>

419
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,130
It's no use.

420
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,799
Did you find out anything, Tonbo?

421
00:39:04,567 --> 00:39:09,114
Not yet... Nothing promising that
is linked to Pain.

422
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:18,773
<i>Today's corpse is light.</i>

423
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,734
<i>It's a knack I got
from years of experience.</i>

424
00:39:22,841 --> 00:39:24,176
<i>This one's a woman.</i>

425
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:29,742
<i>The highest tower in the village
where we always deliver these bodies...</i>

426
00:39:31,028 --> 00:39:32,780
<i>You know what that's for?</i>

427
00:39:33,988 --> 00:39:37,666
<i>In a village like ours, isn't it usually
where the ashes are enshrined?</i>

428
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:42,463
<i>They were originally built as
a memorial to honor the dead.</i>

429
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:46,550
<i>If that's the case, why is it off-limits
to the relatives of the dead too?</i>

430
00:39:47,423 --> 00:39:49,049
<i>Like I care.</i>

431
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,890
<i>What? Stop acting arrogant.</i>

432
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:59,355
<i>Actually... Rumor has it that
Lord Pain lives up there.</i>

433
00:39:59,798 --> 00:40:01,591
<i>Really? That's something.</i>

434
00:40:02,255 --> 00:40:03,673
<i>But there's no way.</i>

435
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:06,445
<i>It's just a rumor. A rumor...</i>

436
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,532
<i>Never mind that. I'm going to confirm it.</i>

437
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:16,038
<i>Just like you said. It's a woman.</i>

438
00:40:17,253 --> 00:40:18,254
<i>Good work.</i>

439
00:40:19,467 --> 00:40:21,093
<i>Oh, Lady Angel...</i>

440
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,923
<i>Now quickly, bring the next one.</i>

441
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:34,974
Inoichi is really amazing!

442
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:38,894
He scanned half a day's worth of memories
in just 30 seconds...

443
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,272
I can barely keep up!

444
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:42,606
You fool!

445
00:40:43,258 --> 00:40:47,203
If you have time to talk, find
something that we can link to Pain!

446
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:55,536
Sorry for interrupting.

447
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,585
It's me, Shizune!

448
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:01,876
Lady Hokage ordered me
to come here!

449
00:41:02,629 --> 00:41:04,172
Did you learn anything on your side?

450
00:41:04,936 --> 00:41:07,271
Yes! I will explain immediately!

451
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,400
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

452
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:23,547
Could it be that they use this to
transmit chakra to each other?

453
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:27,985
It's a similar ability to
our clan's hidden jutsu.

454
00:41:28,605 --> 00:41:30,315
The forefather of all ninja,

455
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,966
the Sage of the Six Paths,
possessed the legendary Rinnegan.

456
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:34,826
Someone who possesses
the same eye...

457
00:41:35,313 --> 00:41:37,273
If such a person really does exist,

458
00:41:38,101 --> 00:41:40,562
then it wouldn't be a surprise,
no matter what jutsu he uses.

459
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,249
What was that?!

460
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:49,507
It seems they have
shown up here as well.

461
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:01,393
We will stop them.

462
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,814
<i>Wind Style: Wind Blade Jutsu!</i>

463
00:42:10,113 --> 00:42:11,906
<i>Lightning Style: Four-Pillar Trap!</i>

464
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:21,413
<i>Earth Style:</i>

465
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:23,457
<i>Buta Futa!</i>

466
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,755
Well? Did we do it?

467
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:48,607
What?!

468
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:50,759
This beast... is growing more heads!

469
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:52,987
Looks like a special type
of Summoning.

470
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:56,641
Rather than fighting the beast,
let's find the one casting the jutsu!

471
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,580
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

472
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:11,630
Wh-What is that?!

473
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:28,147
As I thought...

474
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:40,284
It seems I made it in time.

475
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,494
Lady Katsuyu, thank you so much!

476
00:43:43,081 --> 00:43:47,377
Eek! Forgive me, Lady Katsuyu,
I'm just not used to you yet.

477
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:48,709
It's quite all right.

478
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:57,426
They are powerful Summonings.

479
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,011
Everyone, please be careful.

480
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:02,389
There's no mistake...

481
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,559
When I looked into the mind of
that fellow from the Hidden Rain...

482
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:06,646
I saw her.

483
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:12,107
She was a corpse!

484
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:19,990
<i>And that dead body...
is now using a Summoning Jutsu!</i>

485
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:23,077
<i>It was thought each
of the six Pains</i>

486
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:25,079
<i>uses only one type of jutsu.</i>

487
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:27,623
<i>But something's wrong!</i>

488
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:30,668
<i>Lord Fukasaku said that
the only one who was able</i>

489
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:33,253
<i>to use Summoning was the Pain
we did the autopsy on!</i>

490
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,422
<i>What's going on?!</i>

491
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:37,258
<i>The Pain who was capable
of the Summoning Jutsu</i>

492
00:44:37,283 --> 00:44:39,493
<i>has already been killed
by Lord Jiraiya!</i>

493
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,054
Leave this place to
the ANBU Black Ops and me.

494
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,097
Get to safety!

495
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:44,556
Ibiki...!

496
00:44:44,977 --> 00:44:46,770
Let's hurry, Inoichi!

497
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:49,103
We must uncover
Pain's true identity!

498
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,359
We'll head to the Cipher Division
for the time being.

499
00:44:56,026 --> 00:45:00,280
Have Ino accompany us
to assist your jutsu.

500
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,032
Got it...

501
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:06,787
<i>It's me, Ino. Listen carefully.</i>

502
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:09,123
<i>We are moving to the Cipher Division.</i>

503
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:24,179
We shall be your opponents!

504
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:47,578
<i>That mark...</i>

505
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:52,082
<i>It's the gang that killed
Uncle Asuma... The Akatsuki!</i>

506
00:45:54,873 --> 00:46:00,128
Is Naruto Uzumaki here in
the village or not? Which is it?

507
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:01,717
Naruto?!

508
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:04,386
He's... a member of the village.

509
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,638
We would never sell out a comrade!

510
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:11,310
The Will of Fire, eh?

511
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,271
What?!

512
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:18,192
If you do not answer my question,
you die.

513
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,068
I will ask you one more time.

514
00:46:27,133 --> 00:46:29,051
What is this?

515
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:34,291
Is Naruto Uzumaki here in
the village or not? Which is it?

516
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,251
I know nothing!

517
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,587
So get lost!

518
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:42,883
We don't know a thing! Let us go!

519
00:46:43,498 --> 00:46:46,459
I see...
Then I shall pass judgment.

520
00:47:20,389 --> 00:47:23,809
It seems you truly did not know.

521
00:47:29,773 --> 00:47:31,983
<i>Wh-What's going on?!</i>

522
00:47:32,304 --> 00:47:36,016
<i>He didn't even touch him,
yet the guy on the left just dropped?!</i>

523
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,397
<i>What did he do?!</i>

524
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:43,151
<i>Was the Chunin fellow killed without
being able to defend himself at all?</i>

525
00:47:44,292 --> 00:47:47,712
<i>I-I'd better get away from here.
It's too dangerous!</i>

526
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:52,661
<i>Oh no! Is he on to me?!</i>

527
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:03,130
It seems you went ahead
to do as you please!

528
00:48:03,717 --> 00:48:07,602
I have no mercy for scum like you!

529
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:12,264
<i>Now is your chance to
get away, Konohamaru!</i>

530
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:29,156
It'll take more than that to kill me!

531
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,160
Ebisu-sensei...

532
00:48:51,211 --> 00:48:53,546
<i>Good... He got away.</i>

533
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:03,190
<i>I messed up...</i>

534
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:07,194
<i>But I've done what I needed to do.</i>

535
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:13,992
Is Naruto Uzumaki here
in the village, or not?

536
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:17,496
If you know, speak up.

537
00:49:19,095 --> 00:49:21,598
N-Naruto?

538
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:25,003
It seems you do know Naruto Uzumaki.

539
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:27,005
Then tell me where he is.

540
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:34,221
I may... not look it...

541
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:36,473
but I do hold the elite rank
of instructor.

542
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:40,519
Naruto is my student.

543
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:44,019
Long ago, I considered him
a nuisance...

544
00:49:44,044 --> 00:49:48,799
Who stood in the way
of Konohamaru's path to Hokage.

545
00:49:50,382 --> 00:49:52,843
That's what I believed...

546
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:57,619
However, Naruto didn't allow
his cursed fate to discourage him.

547
00:49:57,783 --> 00:50:00,563
With unending optimism and
a never-say-die attitude

548
00:50:00,588 --> 00:50:03,466
he faced one challenge after
another and overcame them.

549
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:09,818
The important lessons I couldn't teach,
despite being an instructor myself...

550
00:50:09,843 --> 00:50:13,013
Naruto taught them to my students.

551
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:19,808
You... have rambled on too long.

552
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,601
This is your last chance.

553
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:25,897
Do you know where Naruto is,
or don't you?

554
00:50:26,539 --> 00:50:30,043
Answer me! Or else I'll kill you.

555
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:34,281
<i>Naruto... You...</i>

556
00:50:34,404 --> 00:50:38,725
<i>You will overcome the death of
your master and carry on his legacy.</i>

557
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:43,206
<i>The strong will you possess
will teach Konohamaru...</i>

558
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:47,169
<i>no, everyone in the village,
many things.</i>

559
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:54,801
Naruto is a member
of the Hidden Leaf!

560
00:50:55,552 --> 00:51:00,015
I have no intention of telling
you Akatsuki anything!

561
00:51:00,528 --> 00:51:02,447
I see... Then...

562
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:16,823
<i>Brother Naruto...</i>

563
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:21,681
<i>When people look at me
or call out to me,</i>

564
00:51:21,706 --> 00:51:24,292
<i>they only see me as the grandson
of the Hokage.</i>

565
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:26,750
<i>And I'm sick of it!</i>

566
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:30,545
<i>That's why I want the title
of Hokage right now!</i>

567
00:51:32,153 --> 00:51:34,530
<i>It's not easy, stupid!</i>

568
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,786
<i>You keep harping on about the Hokage.</i>

569
00:51:36,811 --> 00:51:39,480
<i>If you want that title so badly...</i>

570
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,766
<i>you can have it over
my dead body!</i>

571
00:51:44,654 --> 00:51:46,739
<i>Then starting now... we're rivals!</i>

572
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:51,983
<i>One day, we'll fight over
the name of Hokage.</i>

573
00:51:52,577 --> 00:51:56,247
<i>So look forward to that day,
Konohamaru!</i>

574
00:52:03,388 --> 00:52:06,016
<i>I guess this is the end of the road.</i>

575
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:09,543
<i>I hope that Konohamaru was
able to escape.</i>

576
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:11,253
Die...

577
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:20,595
I'll take you on!

578
00:52:22,436 --> 00:52:25,522
Konohamaru!
Why didn't you run away?!

579
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:29,871
You have the potential to one day
become a Hokage!

580
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:33,024
Do not waste your life in
a place like this!

581
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:37,404
I made a promise long ago.

582
00:52:38,499 --> 00:52:42,336
To fight Brother Naruto over
the title of Hokage...

583
00:52:43,303 --> 00:52:44,554
That's what we promised.

584
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,581
Brother Naruto is my rival!

585
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:51,084
So I'll never choose to run away!

586
00:52:53,511 --> 00:52:57,098
Because Brother Naruto won't be waiting
at the end of a shortcut!

587
00:52:58,572 --> 00:52:59,573
<i>So fast!</i>

588
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,381
S-Sensei!

589
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:44,179
Is Naruto Uzumaki here in
the village or not? Which is it?

590
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:48,558
<i>I get it... So this is what you see
if you get caught.</i>

591
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:50,268
Now, answer me.

592
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:59,236
<i>I'm starting to figure out... his ability.</i>

593
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:02,322
I don't have a clue!

594
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:21,466
<i>Konohamaru! There's a jutsu
I want to teach you!</i>

595
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:25,095
<i>It's an A-Rank level jutsu in terms
of difficulty to master.</i>

596
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:27,639
<i>A Shadow Clone?!</i>

597
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,767
<i>Super advanced ninjutsu that combines</i>

598
00:54:30,899 --> 00:54:34,187
<i>chakra rotation, power,
and contained...</i>

599
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:35,563
<i>- Rasengan!
- Rasengan!</i>

600
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:53,011
<i>Wh-When did he learn... such a...?</i>

601
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:55,583
I am a Genin of the Sarutobi clan,

602
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,127
honored with the name
of this village!

603
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,587
My surname is Sarutobi!
My given name is Konohamaru!

604
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,423
Remember that!

605
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:14,477
<i>Fang Over Fang!</i>

606
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:24,988
He used the corpse as a shield.

607
00:55:26,263 --> 00:55:27,723
I figured as much.

608
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,951
The reports were right.

609
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,996
Physical attacks seem
to be his weakness!

610
00:55:47,632 --> 00:55:50,468
Shino, we're going to exterminate her
with our full power.

611
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:52,003
Yes.

612
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:55,769
I'm so hungry!

613
00:55:56,015 --> 00:56:00,061
Let's rest a bit.
We're all tired from the mission.

614
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:05,362
What's the matter, Guy-sensei?

615
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:08,586
Have you noticed large numbers
of birds

616
00:56:08,611 --> 00:56:11,238
flying away from the direction
of the village?

617
00:56:11,705 --> 00:56:13,165
As though they were fleeing.

618
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,955
I also have this bad feeling...

619
00:56:16,483 --> 00:56:18,527
We should head straight
for the village.

620
00:56:19,229 --> 00:56:20,355
What?!

621
00:56:20,972 --> 00:56:22,014
Let's go, everyone!

622
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:25,258
Seriously!

623
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:33,348
Behind you!

624
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:48,571
Six piercings in the nose,
seven in the ear... It's him.

625
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,699
It's been a long time, Lady Tsunade.

626
00:56:52,478 --> 00:56:54,772
You are the last remaining
of the Legendary Sannin.

627
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:59,207
I wish to take a moment
to speak with you.

628
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:02,377
You are that boy...

629
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:11,386
... from long ago.

630
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:13,847
It seems you remember me.

631
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:15,974
You know him?

632
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:18,184
A little...

633
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:19,769
Who is he?

634
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:22,689
A god who restores order.

635
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,651
It seems he's not in his right mind.

636
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:30,530
Naruto Uzumaki...
Where is the Nine-Tails?

637
00:57:31,598 --> 00:57:32,599
Who knows...?

638
00:57:33,336 --> 00:57:35,505
The hunt for the Jinchuriki is about over.

639
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:39,247
The Tailed Beasts are
no longer deterrents

640
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:41,624
in maintaining the power balance
between the ninja villages.

641
00:57:43,837 --> 00:57:47,757
It's meaningless to protect
the Nine-Tails now.

642
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:51,134
The war will begin very soon.

643
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:55,430
Seeds of war exist everywhere,
ready to explode.

644
00:57:56,274 --> 00:57:59,986
And we shall control those wars.

645
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:04,981
If you cooperate with us,
we would not be averse to helping you.

646
00:58:06,014 --> 00:58:07,766
From the state of this village...

647
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:10,528
You should know what
we are capable of.

648
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:13,072
Don't underestimate the Five Kages!

649
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:16,451
You terrorists seek to destroy
the peace

650
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:20,788
our predecessors strived
to bring and maintain!

651
00:58:21,153 --> 00:58:22,780
Your words fall on deaf ears!

652
00:58:24,850 --> 00:58:25,781
Such arrogance!

653
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:29,172
<i>Such chakra...</i>

654
00:58:29,773 --> 00:58:31,733
<i>This is the power of the Rinnegan?</i>

655
00:58:32,449 --> 00:58:34,075
<i>I've never seen anything like it.</i>

656
00:58:34,755 --> 00:58:38,885
Your peace has brought
violence upon us.

657
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,226
I will admit that

658
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:44,604
some of the past actions of
the Hidden Leaf were not just.

659
00:58:45,353 --> 00:58:48,272
But your actions here
are unforgivable!

660
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,735
Be careful of what you say.

661
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:54,531
This is your final warning from a god.

662
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:56,533
Tell me where Naruto is.

663
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:01,663
Speak!

664
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:06,709
We will pour every ounce of power
we have into bringing you down!

665
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,836
That is all I have to say!

666
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:13,341
One other thing...
You have made a huge error!

667
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:18,510
What you desire, you shall never get!

668
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:25,353
If you think the Hidden Leaf has what
it takes to protect Naruto, then...

669
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,396
Wrong!

670
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:31,859
Naruto... is strong.

671
00:59:32,361 --> 00:59:33,695
There are six Pains.

672
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:36,698
Each one can only use
one type of jutsu.

673
00:59:38,257 --> 00:59:40,384
That woman used Summoning Jutsu.

674
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:46,480
That means the Pain killed by Lord Jiraiya
was replaced by a different body.

675
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:48,793
And there's no mistake...

676
00:59:49,281 --> 00:59:53,869
that woman was transported to
Hidden Rain's tower as a corpse.

677
00:59:55,211 --> 00:59:58,422
Did that woman's corpse have
this embedded in her?

678
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:01,681
No... I'm sure she didn't.

679
01:00:03,033 --> 01:00:04,826
This proves that Lord Fukasaku
was right.

680
01:00:05,335 --> 01:00:09,631
Pain has the power to bring
the dead back to life.

681
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:13,484
Furthermore, he is able to
substitute bodies as often as he wants,

682
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:17,196
and controls them by planting
these black chakra receivers.

683
01:00:17,453 --> 01:00:19,788
Then those six Pains are...

684
01:00:20,181 --> 01:00:22,475
It's possible all of them are
actually dead bodies.

685
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:26,748
And if they have receivers,
they must also have transmitters.

686
01:00:27,446 --> 01:00:28,989
So someone is in the shadows,

687
01:00:29,014 --> 01:00:33,435
sending chakra signals and
manipulating them.

688
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:35,089
Yes.

689
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:38,301
The coded message left behind
by Lord Jiraiya,

690
01:00:38,326 --> 01:00:40,161
"The real one's not among them...”

691
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:44,349
Perhaps it meant that none of
the six Pains is the real Pain.

692
01:00:44,686 --> 01:00:47,689
What?! You mean there are
still others out there?!

693
01:00:48,232 --> 01:00:49,441
Exactly.

694
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,491
<i>I did anticipate that possibility...</i>

695
01:00:52,827 --> 01:00:56,497
<i>But as the worst-case scenario,
I really didn't want it to be true.</i>

696
01:00:57,779 --> 01:01:00,573
And that someone possesses
considerable chakra.

697
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,452
They are able to control this
many bodies remotely, this freely,

698
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:05,745
using just their chakra.

699
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:09,374
It's similar to our Yamanaka clan's,
Mind Transfer Jutsu.

700
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:12,377
But normally you can only
manipulate one person with chakra.

701
01:01:13,005 --> 01:01:14,798
There are six Pains.

702
01:01:15,719 --> 01:01:18,097
Does this mean there are
six others in the shadows?

703
01:01:18,482 --> 01:01:20,026
We don't know that.

704
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:22,970
In any case, if this is
a Mind Transfer Jutsu,

705
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:27,141
he has to be pretty close to
the receiver in order to transmit chakra.

706
01:01:27,409 --> 01:01:30,453
Otherwise, it would be impossible to pull
off that magnitude of jutsu and attacks.

707
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:33,648
He must be hidden somewhere
close to the Leaf Village.

708
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:36,275
We need to notify
Lady Tsunade immediately,

709
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:38,986
and organize a search party
to find the hidden Pain.

710
01:01:39,489 --> 01:01:40,490
What?!

711
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,199
<i>How did we not notice him?!</i>

712
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,751
Do not make a move...

713
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,880
or this woman will die.

714
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:01,092
Damn it!

715
01:02:08,015 --> 01:02:09,726
Mount Myoboku...

716
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,646
The same jutsu that Father uses!

717
01:02:13,914 --> 01:02:17,042
But he was able to search her mind
in seconds without any device?!

718
01:02:19,264 --> 01:02:22,559
It seems Naruto is not here.

719
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:25,199
Mount Myoboku.

720
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:26,617
What?!

721
01:02:47,922 --> 01:02:48,923
What?!

722
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:50,099
They retreated?

723
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:55,772
What's going on?

724
01:02:56,814 --> 01:02:58,191
Mount Myoboku...

725
01:02:58,389 --> 01:03:00,724
That is the hidden village of the toads.

726
01:03:01,914 --> 01:03:04,583
Well then, lingering here is useless.

727
01:03:05,264 --> 01:03:06,348
How did you know?

728
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:08,284
Why you...

729
01:03:09,702 --> 01:03:10,703
Lady Tsunade...

730
01:03:11,078 --> 01:03:15,166
We should let them go and
in the meantime, fortify the village.

731
01:03:17,249 --> 01:03:18,959
May I ask you one last question?

732
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:22,443
That chakra in your legs...

733
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:26,052
Was it to counter my jutsu?

734
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:30,973
It seems you've realized my ability.

735
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:35,061
However, all is meaningless
before overwhelming power.

736
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:38,606
Your great nations proved
that over the years.

737
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:44,993
You all think that you have
the leading roles in this world,

738
01:03:45,018 --> 01:03:47,120
and do not think twice about death.

739
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:50,159
Soothed by peace, you become shallow.

740
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:53,937
If you kill people, you shall be killed.

741
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:58,960
Hatred brings about
this cause and effect.

742
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:02,129
Quit babbling such nonsense.

743
01:04:02,564 --> 01:04:07,694
In battle, both sides suffer death,
injury, and pain.

744
01:04:08,022 --> 01:04:10,608
And we of the Great Nations
have had our share of pain!

745
01:04:11,143 --> 01:04:14,229
Stop finding excuses for your actions!

746
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:20,648
Feel pain.

747
01:04:21,574 --> 01:04:23,493
Contemplate pain.

748
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:33,494
Accept pain. Know pain!

749
01:04:36,173 --> 01:04:40,052
One who does not know pain cannot
possibly understand true peace!

750
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:51,429
Bad news! Lord Fukasaku!

751
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:55,057
What is wrong?

752
01:04:55,948 --> 01:04:59,118
Our messenger, Kosuke,
has been killed.

753
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:00,813
What?!

754
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:03,853
His name...
vanished from the register.

755
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:10,156
Does that mean something has
happened to the Leaf Village?

756
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:11,443
What?!

757
01:05:12,077 --> 01:05:15,121
Naruto-boy, I have a bad feeling.

758
01:05:15,953 --> 01:05:17,246
Geezer Sage...

759
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:20,166
Don't tell me the Akatsuki
attacked the village!

760
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:25,379
Luckily, Ma went to gather provisions
and is near the Leaf Village.

761
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:30,843
She will be capable of summoning
strong warriors, including us.

762
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:32,553
Get ready now!

763
01:05:33,133 --> 01:05:34,134
Right!

764
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:38,476
<i>Damn it...</i>

765
01:05:39,258 --> 01:05:41,218
<i>I won't get to all of them like this!</i>

766
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:49,904
Lady Shizune!

767
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:57,620
What?!

768
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:04,418
They seem to have retreated.

769
01:06:05,262 --> 01:06:08,807
Yes... But it doesn't make sense.

770
01:06:14,532 --> 01:06:15,617
Lady Shizune...

771
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:23,729
Their scents are completely gone.

772
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:25,398
They're not around here.

773
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:30,027
I guess my power scared them off!

774
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:34,615
<i>That's coming from the Leaf Village.</i>

775
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:38,202
<i>Oh my goodness...</i>

776
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:40,246
Lady Shima!

777
01:06:41,265 --> 01:06:43,309
I came through
the distance teleporting pool.

778
01:06:43,457 --> 01:06:45,042
I have a message
from Lord Fukasaku.

779
01:06:45,447 --> 01:06:46,907
To summon them, eh?

780
01:07:01,055 --> 01:07:03,265
Pain! What do you intend to do?!

781
01:07:05,884 --> 01:07:09,763
You can't! That jutsu
will shorten your life!

782
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:15,031
The power of the six is...

783
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:18,492
You're really going to do this,
aren't you, Nagato?

784
01:07:19,030 --> 01:07:22,325
I will never forget Yahiko's pain.

785
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:29,628
And now...
This world shall know pain.

786
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:32,631
<i>Almighty Push...</i>

787
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,185
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

788
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:33,859
Wh-What is this?!

789
01:08:35,569 --> 01:08:37,696
How could this hap—

790
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:44,787
Naruto... Hurry!

791
01:08:46,873 --> 01:08:50,585
Please, Naruto!

792
01:09:25,116 --> 01:09:26,701
Lady Tsunade, are you all right?!

793
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:28,747
Yes...

794
01:09:41,164 --> 01:09:42,415
You will not get away with this...

795
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:44,013
You will not get away with this, Pain!

796
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,143
<i>The mark on her forehead is gone!</i>

797
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:52,354
<i>She has already released
her Mitotic Regeneration Jutsu</i>

798
01:09:52,469 --> 01:09:54,263
<i>and given all her chakra
to Lady Katsuyu.</i>

799
01:09:55,065 --> 01:09:58,319
<i>In order to protect the villagers
from this Pain's jutsu...</i>

800
01:10:00,779 --> 01:10:02,281
<i>She can no longer...</i>

801
01:10:08,625 --> 01:10:10,085
Are you all right, Iruka?!

802
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:11,916
Forgive me.

803
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:15,037
It took everything...
just to cover you all.

804
01:10:16,128 --> 01:10:18,380
You are not to blame, Lady Katsuyu.

805
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,381
Damn!

806
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:08,430
Hang in there, Kiba!

807
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:13,102
Ow!

808
01:11:22,071 --> 01:11:23,447
This is nothing.

809
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:27,116
Are you all right, Lady Hinata?

810
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:30,077
Yes, but Ko, you're injured.

811
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:33,998
If anything should happen to you during
Lord Hiashi and Lady Hanabi's absence,

812
01:11:34,078 --> 01:11:36,080
I will be dishonored for life.

813
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:38,877
You need not concern yourself
with me.

814
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:41,338
But I must!

815
01:11:41,895 --> 01:11:45,357
If everyone is injured while
the head of the family is away,

816
01:11:45,557 --> 01:11:47,017
I will be the one scolded.

817
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:49,888
Lady Hinata...

818
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,812
Are you all right, Shikamaru?!

819
01:11:57,271 --> 01:12:01,525
Yeah... But what's going on?!

820
01:12:02,026 --> 01:12:03,527
You okay, Shikamaru?!

821
01:12:03,772 --> 01:12:07,192
I made it out, but my leg's broken.

822
01:12:07,614 --> 01:12:10,034
You should consider yourself lucky

823
01:12:10,075 --> 01:12:12,036
if the only thing you suffered in
this attack was a leg injury.

824
01:12:16,856 --> 01:12:17,857
That's...

825
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:21,170
It's Naruto!

826
01:12:21,253 --> 01:12:22,004
Naruto?!

827
01:12:32,097 --> 01:12:35,267
Where are we anyway?

828
01:12:41,899 --> 01:12:43,359
What's going on, Ma?!

829
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:46,528
Why didn't you Summon us
to the Leaf Village?

830
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:49,948
This is the Hidden Leaf Village.

831
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:52,368
It can't be...!

832
01:13:00,292 --> 01:13:02,711
And it's obvious who did this.

833
01:13:03,411 --> 01:13:07,249
I sense the same energies as when
we rode atop Jiraiya-boy's shoulders.

834
01:13:19,436 --> 01:13:21,563
You saved us the trouble
of looking for you.

835
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,865
Why are you being so reckless?

836
01:14:16,994 --> 01:14:19,955
This is... my justice.

837
01:14:21,616 --> 01:14:23,618
<i>The effectiveness of the jutsu</i>

838
01:14:23,643 --> 01:14:26,354
<i>when all the chakra is concentrated
in Tendo is great,</i>

839
01:14:26,753 --> 01:14:28,881
<i>but it also increases the risks.</i>

840
01:14:29,598 --> 01:14:32,609
<i>Not only that, the other five
are recovering much slower</i>

841
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:34,595
<i>compared to the last time
this jutsu was used.</i>

842
01:14:35,053 --> 01:14:37,139
From here on out,
I'll be looking after you.

843
01:14:37,504 --> 01:14:39,631
No more Paper Clones.

844
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:42,895
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

845
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:52,404
Looks like all six have assembled.

846
01:14:56,283 --> 01:14:57,284
Tsunade?

847
01:14:59,785 --> 01:15:02,556
I am the Fifth Hokage!

848
01:15:02,581 --> 01:15:03,582
Lady Hokage!

849
01:15:07,294 --> 01:15:11,298
You trampled on the jewel,
the dreams of my predecessors.

850
01:15:11,607 --> 01:15:13,067
I will not forgive you!

851
01:15:14,801 --> 01:15:17,429
I will settle this now as the Hokage!

852
01:15:18,325 --> 01:15:21,161
It appears you now understand
a little about pain.

853
01:15:21,892 --> 01:15:25,020
However... my business is not with you.

854
01:15:25,859 --> 01:15:27,152
My business is...

855
01:15:29,107 --> 01:15:30,442
With me!

856
01:15:39,743 --> 01:15:43,288
There's no need for the Leaf's Hokage
to bother herself with the likes of them.

857
01:15:43,695 --> 01:15:45,739
You just sit back and
sip some tea, Granny.

858
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:47,042
Naruto!

859
01:15:48,502 --> 01:15:50,337
Naruto Uzumaki.

860
01:15:51,838 --> 01:15:53,674
Let's settle this!

861
01:15:56,677 --> 01:16:00,472
<i>Tendo's power won't return
for quite some time.</i>

862
01:16:00,893 --> 01:16:02,144
<i>In which case...</i>

863
01:16:04,721 --> 01:16:05,635
Gamakichi!

864
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:09,398
Take Granny Tsunade to
someplace safe!

865
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:10,775
Gotcha!

866
01:16:11,191 --> 01:16:14,236
Granny, I'll take over from here!

867
01:16:14,387 --> 01:16:17,014
Tell everyone in the village
to stay out of the way!

868
01:16:17,489 --> 01:16:20,909
It'll be difficult to fight while trying
to cover for them.

869
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:23,036
Understood.

870
01:16:24,037 --> 01:16:28,000
But take Katsuyu.
I know she'll be useful to you.

871
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,085
She has intel on them.

872
01:16:34,798 --> 01:16:39,136
Katsuyu... Keep yourself hidden
in Naruto-boy's clothes.

873
01:16:39,469 --> 01:16:40,470
Yes, sir.

874
01:16:43,856 --> 01:16:47,860
Now may not be the right time
to ask a question like this...

875
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:51,398
But now that I've mastered
Nature Energy...

876
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:55,402
I'm able to sense everyone's chakra.

877
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:01,783
Is Kakashi-sensei on a mission
away from the village?

878
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:09,166
I see...

879
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:20,260
Master!

880
01:17:23,221 --> 01:17:24,222
Lady Tsunade!

881
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:25,641
Sakura...

882
01:17:26,433 --> 01:17:28,435
Everything is okay now.

883
01:17:31,438 --> 01:17:32,439
Yes...

884
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:37,235
<i>Thank you, Lady Tsunade.</i>

885
01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:41,531
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

886
01:17:55,087 --> 01:17:56,588
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

887
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:02,678
<i>– Sage Art: Frog Song!
– Sage Art: Frog Song!</i>

888
01:18:07,432 --> 01:18:08,600
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

889
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:19,361
<i>– Sage Art: Giant Rasengan!
– Sage Art: Giant Rasengan!</i>

890
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:23,490
Bunta-boy! Ken-boy! Hiro-boy!

891
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:24,991
Right on!

892
01:18:29,246 --> 01:18:32,916
Naruto! Ninjutsu won't work
on the Pain standing before you.

893
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:36,586
He will absorb all your ninjutsu attacks.

894
01:18:37,295 --> 01:18:39,297
Then we'll go with Frog Kumite!

895
01:19:00,444 --> 01:19:02,738
<i>Stay still, you mutt!</i>

896
01:19:06,366 --> 01:19:08,577
<i>I thought we dodged it...</i>

897
01:19:08,952 --> 01:19:13,540
<i>Frog Kumite utilizes
the Nature Energy around you.</i>

898
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:18,879
<i>The energy became part of
Naruto's body when he attacked Pain!</i>

899
01:19:19,212 --> 01:19:22,841
<i>In Sage Mode, both threat perception
and attack range</i>

900
01:19:22,883 --> 01:19:24,885
<i>are enhanced way
beyond the ordinary.</i>

901
01:19:25,343 --> 01:19:27,220
No time to waste here!

902
01:19:27,345 --> 01:19:29,264
I'll finish this with my new jutsu!

903
01:19:29,597 --> 01:19:30,931
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

904
01:19:33,226 --> 01:19:36,188
I see... So you have become a Sage...

905
01:19:36,433 --> 01:19:39,603
mastering the same jutsu
as Jiraiya-sensei.

906
01:19:40,221 --> 01:19:42,557
Jiraiya... Sensei?

907
01:19:43,528 --> 01:19:45,989
I also learned jutsu from Jiraiya.

908
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:48,742
He was once my master...

909
01:19:49,701 --> 01:19:51,912
Which make us fellow disciples.

910
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:56,366
Sharing the same master, you and I
should be able to understand one another.

911
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:59,086
Our master desired peace.

912
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:01,087
Shut the hell up!

913
01:20:03,924 --> 01:20:05,759
Such massive chakra...

914
01:20:05,759 --> 01:20:07,302
Did you teach him that, Pa?

915
01:20:07,886 --> 01:20:10,514
No... I'm seeing it for
the first time too.

916
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:12,682
All that...

917
01:20:13,304 --> 01:20:14,639
you've done here...

918
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:18,146
Where's the "peace" in that?!

919
01:20:19,144 --> 01:20:21,313
You're only looking at the tree,
not the whole forest.

920
01:20:22,025 --> 01:20:25,320
You don't know
the true meaning of peace.

921
01:20:27,557 --> 01:20:29,392
So let yourself be captured.

922
01:20:29,866 --> 01:20:32,244
Your death will lead to peace.

923
01:20:32,244 --> 01:20:35,705
I told you... to shut the hell up!

924
01:20:55,308 --> 01:20:56,768
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

925
01:21:12,742 --> 01:21:14,911
Deidara was right.

926
01:21:15,328 --> 01:21:17,622
He does not listen.

927
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:21,501
What was that?

928
01:21:21,918 --> 01:21:23,295
What's going on?

929
01:21:23,753 --> 01:21:25,130
Who's fighting them?!

930
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:26,631
It's Naruto.

931
01:21:26,756 --> 01:21:27,757
Naruto?!

932
01:21:27,924 --> 01:21:29,342
Naruto is back?

933
01:21:30,051 --> 01:21:31,052
Yes.

934
01:21:31,177 --> 01:21:35,015
He has mastered Sage Jutsu
and is now fighting Pain alone.

935
01:21:35,265 --> 01:21:36,266
What?!

936
01:21:41,813 --> 01:21:42,898
<i>Damn this leg!</i>

937
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:44,941
Please stay here.

938
01:21:45,483 --> 01:21:47,611
Naruto has asked us not to interfere.

939
01:21:48,278 --> 01:21:50,238
He's so full of himself!

940
01:21:50,447 --> 01:21:52,365
Look what they did to this village!

941
01:21:52,868 --> 01:21:55,538
There is no way
he can take them on by himself...

942
01:21:55,563 --> 01:21:56,564
No.

943
01:21:57,613 --> 01:22:01,993
If he's mastered Sage Jutsu,
he's in a class of his own now.

944
01:22:02,626 --> 01:22:06,922
Staying out of the way is
the best teamwork we can offer for him.

945
01:22:07,464 --> 01:22:09,799
Sit tight, Shikamaru.

946
01:22:18,558 --> 01:22:19,684
<i>Please be careful!</i>

947
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:23,563
<i>The more you strike,
the more it will divide in numbers!</i>

948
01:22:24,731 --> 01:22:26,733
<i>Why didn't you tell me sooner?!</i>

949
01:22:26,733 --> 01:22:28,818
<i>You see... I'm clumsy...</i>

950
01:22:29,792 --> 01:22:31,002
<i>Oww!</i>

951
01:22:31,071 --> 01:22:33,531
<i>So how do we handle this?!</i>

952
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:37,160
<i>We must clumsily endure it for now...</i>

953
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:43,792
Chief...

954
01:22:59,015 --> 01:23:00,767
You're slowing down.

955
01:23:01,434 --> 01:23:04,437
It seems your Sage Jutsu power
is decreasing.

956
01:23:05,421 --> 01:23:08,632
Did you use up your Sage Jutsu chakra
with that last jutsu?

957
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:12,544
<i>Oh no... I'm about to lose Sage Mode!</i>

958
01:23:13,151 --> 01:23:17,322
<i>I have to bring this guy down
before Sage Mode runs out!</i>

959
01:23:19,045 --> 01:23:20,713
Ma, you know what to do!

960
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:24,082
We're going to break the Rinnegan link!

961
01:23:24,722 --> 01:23:25,723
Got it, Pa!

962
01:23:31,881 --> 01:23:32,882
Bunta-boy!

963
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:34,217
<i>Boss!</i>

964
01:23:34,350 --> 01:23:35,351
Listen up.

965
01:23:35,548 --> 01:23:38,801
I'm going to hurl you
straight at Naruto-boy!

966
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:43,351
<i>Hurl... me? But why, Boss?</i>

967
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:47,740
Listen carefully to
what I'm about to tell you.

968
01:23:48,606 --> 01:23:49,858
Ready, Pa?

969
01:23:53,487 --> 01:23:54,571
<i>Sage Art!</i>

970
01:23:54,904 --> 01:23:56,906
<i>Wind Style: Sand Dust!</i>

971
01:24:41,242 --> 01:24:42,869
<i>Where is he?!</i>

972
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:49,918
<i>Rasengan Barrage!</i>

973
01:24:56,841 --> 01:24:57,842
<i>Inside its mouth?!</i>

974
01:25:20,517 --> 01:25:22,143
You've exhausted your Sage Jutsu.

975
01:25:25,956 --> 01:25:30,635
<i>Even in Sage Mode,
two Rasen Shuriken are my limit.</i>

976
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:32,877
Now is my chance.

977
01:25:36,506 --> 01:25:37,590
What?!

978
01:25:37,632 --> 01:25:41,261
You mean we can't merge with him
because of that Nine-Tails?!

979
01:25:41,594 --> 01:25:43,221
It seems that way.

980
01:25:43,638 --> 01:25:45,682
Then what are we to do?!

981
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:49,394
Naruto-boy came up with
his own unique solution.

982
01:25:49,936 --> 01:25:51,896
That's what he's about to do!

983
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:01,990
<i>You little scamp!</i>

984
01:26:04,951 --> 01:26:06,452
<i>Why you...</i>

985
01:26:06,578 --> 01:26:07,787
<i>Damn it!</i>

986
01:26:12,041 --> 01:26:13,084
Damn!

987
01:26:15,837 --> 01:26:17,380
This way, Naruto-boy!

988
01:26:17,547 --> 01:26:19,716
Hand it over! I'll do it!

989
01:26:23,636 --> 01:26:24,637
Bring it on!

990
01:26:29,225 --> 01:26:31,853
<i>Stay back, kid! I'll get him!</i>

991
01:26:31,895 --> 01:26:33,313
I'm going to enter Sage Mode!

992
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:34,814
<i>What?!</i>

993
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:36,441
Get back, Boss!

994
01:26:36,691 --> 01:26:39,068
I don't want you guys to get caught
in my Rasen Shuriken!

995
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:46,201
<i>Acting all tough now...</i>

996
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:52,624
<i>I can replenish Sage chakra
two more times.</i>

997
01:26:53,416 --> 01:26:57,045
<i>That means I have four more tries
with my Rasen Shuriken!</i>

998
01:26:57,861 --> 01:27:00,322
<i>I have to settle this within that time.</i>

999
01:27:03,073 --> 01:27:04,992
Let's do it, Naruto-boy!

1000
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:07,639
<i>Reverse Summoning Jutsu!</i>

1001
01:27:43,716 --> 01:27:44,384
<i>What?</i>

1002
01:28:04,904 --> 01:28:06,406
Wh-What is this?!

1003
01:28:19,029 --> 01:28:20,030
That's right.

1004
01:28:20,380 --> 01:28:23,675
This is the one that absorbs ninjutsu.

1005
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:25,842
But I thought we already
took care of him.

1006
01:28:36,534 --> 01:28:37,535
What is that?

1007
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:40,606
It seems that Pain
is the key player.

1008
01:28:41,232 --> 01:28:42,775
The one Geezer Sage spoke of...

1009
01:28:43,215 --> 01:28:45,300
The one who can resurrect the dead?

1010
01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:49,699
He must be the Pain
who possesses that power.

1011
01:28:50,533 --> 01:28:53,036
That is why when they lined up
in formation...

1012
01:28:53,281 --> 01:28:55,867
that Pain stepped back to take
the rearmost position of the troop.

1013
01:28:56,347 --> 01:28:59,684
And the most troublesome Pain
is the one on the left.

1014
01:29:00,835 --> 01:29:03,171
He hasn't shown his powers yet,

1015
01:29:03,254 --> 01:29:04,756
which is suspicious.

1016
01:29:04,964 --> 01:29:06,529
Perhaps, for some reason,

1017
01:29:06,554 --> 01:29:08,515
he's not able to utilize
his powers yet.

1018
01:29:16,309 --> 01:29:20,396
Either way... We have to get rid
of the guy in the back!

1019
01:29:25,234 --> 01:29:26,861
Along with some smoke bombs!

1020
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:27,777
All right!

1021
01:29:39,278 --> 01:29:42,489
<i>What you absorbed was
a Transformation Jutsu!</i>

1022
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:46,631
Bastard!

1023
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:48,466
You're the original?!

1024
01:29:53,513 --> 01:29:55,014
You can't dodge this!

1025
01:29:55,056 --> 01:29:56,265
This time, I got you for sure!

1026
01:30:05,483 --> 01:30:07,235
My power has finally returned.

1027
01:30:09,112 --> 01:30:10,091
It's not over yet!

1028
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:12,115
<i>Sage Jutsu!</i>

1029
01:30:12,782 --> 01:30:14,575
<i>Rasengan Barrage!</i>

1030
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:16,077
What?!

1031
01:30:26,129 --> 01:30:27,255
<i>Back there...</i>

1032
01:30:27,991 --> 01:30:31,036
<i>He had already slipped into
the smoke and jumped up above.</i>

1033
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:39,600
<i>Just barely in time...</i>

1034
01:30:43,788 --> 01:30:45,498
<i>Almighty Push!</i>

1035
01:30:54,490 --> 01:30:56,075
Are you all right, Naruto-boy?!

1036
01:30:56,659 --> 01:30:57,660
Yeah...

1037
01:31:07,503 --> 01:31:10,131
Damn it! What was that jutsu just now?!

1038
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:14,624
It seems the core Pain's power
has returned.

1039
01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:17,305
You mean, him?

1040
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:22,351
No doubt he used the same jutsu
to blow up the village.

1041
01:31:22,978 --> 01:31:24,938
The more power he uses,

1042
01:31:25,023 --> 01:31:29,027
the longer the interval before
he can use the next jutsu.

1043
01:31:30,287 --> 01:31:34,375
So that's why he couldn't use that
repelling jutsu until just now.

1044
01:31:35,364 --> 01:31:36,449
What are my options?

1045
01:31:38,743 --> 01:31:41,204
Ninjutsu and taijutsu won't work.

1046
01:31:41,478 --> 01:31:43,397
Choji brought us information.

1047
01:31:43,819 --> 01:31:48,490
The minimum interval between
Pain's jutsu is about five seconds.

1048
01:31:49,036 --> 01:31:51,663
You must target and strike
during that interval.

1049
01:31:52,757 --> 01:31:54,133
Only five seconds?

1050
01:31:55,366 --> 01:31:58,161
You'll have to trap him with genjutsu.

1051
01:31:58,387 --> 01:32:02,183
But how?! I suck at genjutsu!

1052
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:04,227
We'll do it!

1053
01:32:04,477 --> 01:32:06,145
Just like before.

1054
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:07,355
Just like before?

1055
01:32:12,918 --> 01:32:14,503
<i>Almighty Push...</i>

1056
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:38,803
Damn it!

1057
01:32:47,390 --> 01:32:48,600
<i>Naruto...</i>

1058
01:32:48,854 --> 01:32:51,649
There's no mistake!
It's definitely Naruto!

1059
01:32:52,525 --> 01:32:54,485
He's fighting alone!

1060
01:32:56,807 --> 01:32:58,433
No, Lady Hinata!

1061
01:32:58,739 --> 01:33:01,117
But Naruto is risking his life
for our village!

1062
01:33:01,617 --> 01:33:05,192
If you enter such a battle,
you will only get in his way

1063
01:33:05,602 --> 01:33:07,813
and put him at risk!

1064
01:33:24,807 --> 01:33:27,602
Hey! We must hurry and
cast the genjutsu.

1065
01:33:27,852 --> 01:33:31,314
Performing a duet before everyone
is so embarrassing.

1066
01:33:31,564 --> 01:33:33,482
Quit complaining and do it!

1067
01:33:33,566 --> 01:33:35,067
I know already!

1068
01:33:35,804 --> 01:33:39,808
This genjutsu requires an enormous
amount of Sage Jutsu Chakra.

1069
01:33:40,170 --> 01:33:44,116
In other words, it will take a little
time before the jutsu activates.

1070
01:33:44,452 --> 01:33:47,413
I'm going to go for that
five-second interval!

1071
01:33:47,595 --> 01:33:50,625
As soon as you take in enough
Sage Jutsu Chakra, start the genjutsu!

1072
01:33:51,208 --> 01:33:55,713
Remember... You only have
one Shadow Clone left

1073
01:33:55,738 --> 01:33:57,948
to take in Sage Jutsu Chakra
for you, Naruto-boy.

1074
01:33:58,382 --> 01:34:01,010
Once that's gone,
it'll be impossible to fight

1075
01:34:01,052 --> 01:34:04,680
while taking in Sage Jutsu Chakra,
as it requires you not to move.

1076
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:08,184
And your Sage Mode will
run out in five minutes.

1077
01:34:08,809 --> 01:34:11,812
Using Shadow Clones to
help you maintain stillness

1078
01:34:11,812 --> 01:34:14,023
and take in Sage Jutsu Chakra
was a good idea.

1079
01:34:14,443 --> 01:34:17,280
But why didn't you make
more of them?

1080
01:34:17,818 --> 01:34:20,946
It's like trying to look to the right
and to the left at the same time.

1081
01:34:21,238 --> 01:34:23,115
We've divided the task,

1082
01:34:23,216 --> 01:34:26,344
but taking in Sage Jutsu Chakra
is extremely difficult.

1083
01:34:26,369 --> 01:34:30,831
At Naruto-boy's current level,
two Shadow Clones were his limit.

1084
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:35,617
On top of that, I can only produce
three Shadow Clones for battle.

1085
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:41,467
Anymore would interfere with
those taking in Sage Jutsu Chakra.

1086
01:34:41,717 --> 01:34:46,347
I see... Either way, prolonging things
isn't to our advantage.

1087
01:35:01,195 --> 01:35:03,364
You are strong indeed.

1088
01:35:04,073 --> 01:35:06,826
This is the farthest Pain
has ever been pushed.

1089
01:35:07,243 --> 01:35:08,536
However...

1090
01:35:08,809 --> 01:35:10,366
<i>Universal Pull.</i>

1091
01:35:18,456 --> 01:35:20,291
That's enough.

1092
01:35:21,006 --> 01:35:23,634
Don't worry. I won't kill you.

1093
01:35:24,978 --> 01:35:27,397
You are a precious Jinchuriki.

1094
01:35:27,805 --> 01:35:31,183
Hah, it doesn't hurt at all!

1095
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:33,320
Don't underestimate
my Sage Mode!

1096
01:35:33,769 --> 01:35:35,396
Now it's my turn to...

1097
01:35:36,147 --> 01:35:38,858
You are right. That is a problem.

1098
01:35:40,109 --> 01:35:42,820
<i>What's happening?
I'm losing power...</i>

1099
01:35:43,696 --> 01:35:49,702
<i>I get it! This guy is sucking out
my Sage Jutsu Chakra!</i>

1100
01:35:54,790 --> 01:35:57,752
Capture of the Nine-Tails,
accomplished.

1101
01:35:59,128 --> 01:36:01,464
<i>You don't have me... yet.</i>

1102
01:36:02,131 --> 01:36:04,341
Quite tenacious, aren't you?

1103
01:36:13,684 --> 01:36:16,228
<i>So that's how it is.</i>

1104
01:36:16,687 --> 01:36:18,814
<i>Well, it's just perfect since
I can't move.</i>

1105
01:36:31,619 --> 01:36:33,829
So you've finally resigned yourself.

1106
01:36:46,184 --> 01:36:50,230
You know, Nature Energy is
really hard to control.

1107
01:37:05,691 --> 01:37:09,820
Sage Jutsu Chakra has its risks,
after all.

1108
01:37:10,238 --> 01:37:12,907
Now, it's just you...

1109
01:37:13,202 --> 01:37:16,413
Well... not quite.

1110
01:37:17,331 --> 01:37:18,874
What do you mean?

1111
01:37:19,458 --> 01:37:22,336
These Pains are puppets.

1112
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:25,881
There is another manipulating
these Pains.

1113
01:37:25,923 --> 01:37:27,466
The real Pain.

1114
01:37:27,675 --> 01:37:28,676
The real Pain?!

1115
01:37:33,866 --> 01:37:35,492
All right, we're ready.

1116
01:37:35,848 --> 01:37:36,974
Let's do it, Ma!

1117
01:37:37,021 --> 01:37:38,022
Gotcha!

1118
01:37:40,792 --> 01:37:41,793
Pa!

1119
01:37:41,818 --> 01:37:42,902
Geezer Sage!

1120
01:37:44,692 --> 01:37:47,486
<i>I've had enough of
that genjutsu.</i>

1121
01:37:54,034 --> 01:37:55,104
Pa!

1122
01:37:55,129 --> 01:37:56,589
Bastard!

1123
01:37:59,290 --> 01:38:00,875
<i>Universal Pull!</i>

1124
01:38:14,237 --> 01:38:18,408
Has this tamed you a little,
Nine-Tails?

1125
01:38:27,155 --> 01:38:28,907
What are you?!

1126
01:38:29,194 --> 01:38:30,779
Just what do you want?!

1127
01:38:30,940 --> 01:38:32,859
Why are you doing all of this?!

1128
01:38:33,449 --> 01:38:35,492
Why, you ask?

1129
01:38:36,619 --> 01:38:39,163
Things always happen
without warning.

1130
01:38:39,204 --> 01:38:41,415
And the reason becomes
apparent afterward.

1131
01:38:43,593 --> 01:38:45,053
This situation...

1132
01:38:45,836 --> 01:38:49,048
Perhaps I will explain to you.

1133
01:38:50,382 --> 01:38:54,053
Use Katsuyu as a medium and
gather every piece of data available

1134
01:38:54,053 --> 01:38:56,084
from those who have
encountered Pain.

1135
01:38:56,588 --> 01:38:59,925
The dead may have left
some information as well.

1136
01:39:00,648 --> 01:39:03,275
Even if we have to haul dead bodies,
find out all we can!

1137
01:39:04,355 --> 01:39:05,981
<i>Haul dead bodies...</i>

1138
01:39:07,024 --> 01:39:12,446
Wait... I think I know where
to find the real Pain!

1139
01:39:12,655 --> 01:39:13,822
What do you mean?

1140
01:39:13,906 --> 01:39:15,658
Did you figure something out?

1141
01:39:16,075 --> 01:39:17,076
Yeah...

1142
01:39:17,868 --> 01:39:21,455
Back when I looked into
the mind of the Hidden Rain ninja

1143
01:39:21,455 --> 01:39:23,540
who was captured by Lord Jiraiya...

1144
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:28,879
His duty was to deliver bodies
with his partner.

1145
01:39:29,546 --> 01:39:31,465
<i>It's a hunch I got from
years of experience.</i>

1146
01:39:33,384 --> 01:39:34,677
<i>This one's a woman.</i>

1147
01:39:35,719 --> 01:39:40,474
<i>The highest tower in the village
where we always deliver these bodies...</i>

1148
01:39:40,599 --> 01:39:42,184
Deliver bodies?

1149
01:39:42,309 --> 01:39:45,354
Yes... Your earlier remark
triggered my memory.

1150
01:39:45,850 --> 01:39:46,851
Now listen...

1151
01:39:47,022 --> 01:39:50,887
First, it's basic knowledge that
one who transmits chakra signals

1152
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:53,581
must be as close to
the receiver as possible.

1153
01:39:54,154 --> 01:39:55,155
And...

1154
01:39:55,239 --> 01:39:58,784
Of the several towers that exist
in Hidden Rain Village,

1155
01:39:58,826 --> 01:40:01,203
this man was delivering bodies
to the tallest tower.

1156
01:40:01,453 --> 01:40:03,122
It was rumored in
Hidden Rain Village

1157
01:40:03,422 --> 01:40:07,760
that Pain could be found
in the tallest tower.

1158
01:40:08,535 --> 01:40:14,291
<i>Actually... Rumor has it
that Lord Pain lives up there.</i>

1159
01:40:15,475 --> 01:40:18,687
And the woman who appeared as Pain...

1160
01:40:18,832 --> 01:40:23,695
She was the same body as the woman
who was delivered to the tallest tower.

1161
01:40:24,685 --> 01:40:28,772
So this tower was the laboratory where
those black rod-like chakra Receivers

1162
01:40:28,797 --> 01:40:31,883
were implanted into corpses
to create the Pains.

1163
01:40:33,235 --> 01:40:38,032
And how is that connected to
the real Pain's whereabouts?

1164
01:40:38,949 --> 01:40:42,953
The best spot to send out
chakra signals...

1165
01:40:43,412 --> 01:40:49,460
It had to be the tallest tower
with the widest and farthest reach.

1166
01:40:49,853 --> 01:40:53,023
I see... That means...

1167
01:40:53,130 --> 01:40:58,552
the real Pain is in the highest spot
close to Leaf Village.

1168
01:40:58,761 --> 01:41:02,639
All right! So we'll search every
single spot that is at a high altitude!

1169
01:41:04,808 --> 01:41:09,021
You asked me why I am
doing all of this.

1170
01:41:09,563 --> 01:41:13,901
Even if I told you why,
I doubt that would change anything.

1171
01:41:14,985 --> 01:41:19,031
But what if we tried to have
a discussion once more?

1172
01:41:19,490 --> 01:41:21,450
I have nothing to discuss
with you.

1173
01:41:22,201 --> 01:41:26,872
My goal is something even
Jiraiya-sensei was unable to achieve.

1174
01:41:29,003 --> 01:41:30,546
As I mentioned earlier...

1175
01:41:31,293 --> 01:41:34,254
Creating peace,
and bringing about justice.

1176
01:41:35,362 --> 01:41:37,281
Peace? Justice?

1177
01:41:37,883 --> 01:41:38,926
Yeah, right...

1178
01:41:39,593 --> 01:41:40,886
Don't give me that crap!

1179
01:41:41,261 --> 01:41:44,723
My master! My sensei!

1180
01:41:45,052 --> 01:41:48,847
My friends! My village!

1181
01:41:55,692 --> 01:41:58,737
After everything you've done,

1182
01:41:58,779 --> 01:42:01,448
don't you dare talk about
peace and justice!

1183
01:42:07,938 --> 01:42:10,649
Then tell me what your goal is?

1184
01:42:10,773 --> 01:42:12,358
I'm going to kill you!

1185
01:42:12,580 --> 01:42:16,250
And bring peace back
to the ninja world!

1186
01:42:18,382 --> 01:42:21,385
I see... That is noble of you.

1187
01:42:21,844 --> 01:42:24,596
That is justice indeed. However...

1188
01:42:26,098 --> 01:42:27,891
My family...

1189
01:42:28,559 --> 01:42:30,060
My friends...

1190
01:42:30,435 --> 01:42:32,020
My village...

1191
01:42:32,479 --> 01:42:34,690
They suffered the same fate
as this village,

1192
01:42:34,715 --> 01:42:36,509
by you Hidden Leaf ninja.

1193
01:42:36,856 --> 01:42:40,902
How is it fair to only allow you people
to preach about peace and justice?

1194
01:42:42,531 --> 01:42:44,032
What are you talking about?!

1195
01:42:44,919 --> 01:42:48,840
The Land of Fire and the Hidden Leaf
had grown too big.

1196
01:42:49,663 --> 01:42:51,290
To protect its national interests,

1197
01:42:51,315 --> 01:42:54,152
it forced feudal clans to wage war
against each other,

1198
01:42:54,177 --> 01:42:55,971
and profited from it.

1199
01:42:56,461 --> 01:43:00,090
Otherwise, the nation and the people
of the villages would have starved.

1200
01:43:00,803 --> 01:43:05,349
However, our small nation and
its villages became the battlefields

1201
01:43:05,374 --> 01:43:07,251
for the Great Nations' war.

1202
01:43:08,055 --> 01:43:11,433
And each time, our nation was ravaged
and laid to waste.

1203
01:43:12,644 --> 01:43:16,315
After all the fighting subsided,
things stabilized in the Great Nation.

1204
01:43:16,815 --> 01:43:20,402
And our small nation was left
to suffer the pain and misery.

1205
01:43:25,324 --> 01:43:28,327
You and I seek the same thing.

1206
01:43:28,702 --> 01:43:32,080
We are trying to establish the peace
that Jiraiya-sensei so desired.

1207
01:43:32,956 --> 01:43:35,459
You and I are not different at all.

1208
01:43:35,959 --> 01:43:38,545
We each act according to
our own sense of justice.

1209
01:43:39,504 --> 01:43:42,424
The justice I delivered
to the Leaf Village

1210
01:43:42,466 --> 01:43:45,719
is no different from what
you are trying to do to me.

1211
01:43:46,386 --> 01:43:49,389
The pain of losing something dear
to you is the same.

1212
01:43:50,182 --> 01:43:54,019
And both of us know
that pain all too well.

1213
01:43:54,853 --> 01:43:57,564
You have your justice...

1214
01:43:58,607 --> 01:44:00,984
And I have mine.

1215
01:44:01,610 --> 01:44:04,363
We are both ordinary men,

1216
01:44:04,388 --> 01:44:06,807
driven to seek vengeance
under the banner of justice.

1217
01:44:07,491 --> 01:44:10,827
However, if there is justice
in vengeance,

1218
01:44:10,852 --> 01:44:13,772
then justice will only breed
more vengeance.

1219
01:44:15,973 --> 01:44:18,601
And trigger a cycle of hatred.

1220
01:44:20,128 --> 01:44:22,756
We are currently living right
in the middle of that very cycle.

1221
01:44:22,881 --> 01:44:25,884
We know what the past has been and
we can predict what the future will be.

1222
01:44:25,884 --> 01:44:27,928
That is history as we know it.

1223
01:44:29,678 --> 01:44:31,763
So we cannot help
but believe that

1224
01:44:31,788 --> 01:44:34,874
human beings are incapable
of understanding each other.

1225
01:44:38,465 --> 01:44:43,095
The world of the ninja
is ruled by hatred.

1226
01:44:48,242 --> 01:44:50,077
<i>However...</i>

1227
01:44:51,252 --> 01:44:56,423
<i>even I can see there's too much
hate in our ninja world.</i>

1228
01:44:57,332 --> 01:44:58,542
<i>Hate?</i>

1229
01:44:59,284 --> 01:45:02,996
<i>And I've wanted to do
something about this hatred,</i>

1230
01:45:03,171 --> 01:45:06,383
<i>yet I'm not sure what must be done.</i>

1231
01:45:06,675 --> 01:45:08,713
<i>But I have faith that
there will come a time</i>

1232
01:45:08,738 --> 01:45:13,535
<i>when people can truly understand
one another.</i>

1233
01:45:14,891 --> 01:45:17,185
<i>It all sounds kinda complicated.</i>

1234
01:45:17,561 --> 01:45:23,525
<i>And if I can't find the answer,
perhaps I will entrust you to find it.</i>

1235
01:45:23,606 --> 01:45:27,526
<i>You got it! I can't turn you down,
can I, Pervy Sage?</i>

1236
01:45:31,408 --> 01:45:36,246
How would you confront this hatred,
in order to create peace?

1237
01:45:40,584 --> 01:45:42,502
I want to hear your answer.

1238
01:45:49,205 --> 01:45:50,498
I don't have an answer...

1239
01:45:50,927 --> 01:45:52,387
to something like that.

1240
01:46:00,937 --> 01:46:06,151
I formed the Akatsuki in order
to stop this cycle of hatred.

1241
01:46:07,022 --> 01:46:09,108
I can put an end to it.

1242
01:46:09,671 --> 01:46:13,883
For that... I need the power
of your Nine-Tails.

1243
01:46:14,651 --> 01:46:19,139
I will use the power of every Tailed
Beast to create a Tailed Beast Weapon,

1244
01:46:19,164 --> 01:46:21,931
many times more potent than
the power that destroyed this village.

1245
01:46:21,956 --> 01:46:24,750
A power enough to wipe out
an entire nation instantly.

1246
01:46:25,921 --> 01:46:27,130
A Tailed Beast Weapon?!

1247
01:46:27,881 --> 01:46:30,634
The world will know real pain.

1248
01:46:30,792 --> 01:46:34,254
The fear instilled by that pain
would prevent wars.

1249
01:46:34,711 --> 01:46:37,964
And the world will be on
the road to stability and peace.

1250
01:46:38,130 --> 01:46:40,924
But that kind of peace...

1251
01:46:41,199 --> 01:46:43,034
It's nothing but a fake!

1252
01:46:43,164 --> 01:46:46,334
Humans are not the most intelligent
of creatures.

1253
01:46:46,508 --> 01:46:49,469
This is the only way that
peace can be achieved.

1254
01:46:50,487 --> 01:46:54,574
And after several decades, that
pain too will eventually fade with time.

1255
01:46:55,362 --> 01:46:57,437
It will no longer be a deterrent

1256
01:46:57,462 --> 01:46:59,672
and humanity will begin to
battle once more.

1257
01:46:59,971 --> 01:47:02,766
This time, they themselves will
use the Tailed Beast Weapon

1258
01:47:03,167 --> 01:47:06,203
against one another and
reconfirm what true pain is.

1259
01:47:06,843 --> 01:47:10,889
And then peace will be
restored again, for a time.

1260
01:47:11,508 --> 01:47:15,178
In the course of
this endless cycle of hatred...

1261
01:47:15,382 --> 01:47:18,760
Pain will give rise to
momentary peace.

1262
01:47:19,683 --> 01:47:21,601
That is my dream.

1263
01:47:24,479 --> 01:47:25,605
Nagato...

1264
01:47:25,605 --> 01:47:27,232
Try not to push yourself.

1265
01:47:27,522 --> 01:47:29,524
You've already spent
so much chakra.

1266
01:47:46,710 --> 01:47:48,879
Peace is right within our grasp.

1267
01:47:57,012 --> 01:47:58,221
What's wrong, Neji?

1268
01:48:00,296 --> 01:48:02,757
That's Lord Jiraiya's Summoning Frog.

1269
01:48:03,018 --> 01:48:04,019
What?!

1270
01:48:05,327 --> 01:48:09,857
So the real Pain will be at the highest
spot, somewhere near the Leaf Village.

1271
01:48:10,395 --> 01:48:14,149
All right, let's search every single site
that is at high altitude!

1272
01:48:14,654 --> 01:48:17,449
Work in teams with
at least two people per cell.

1273
01:48:17,949 --> 01:48:21,495
And if you find the real Pain,
do not engage him carelessly.

1274
01:48:21,831 --> 01:48:25,334
Try to include Sensory-Type ninja
in the search teams.

1275
01:48:25,488 --> 01:48:26,614
It'll be faster.

1276
01:48:26,995 --> 01:48:27,996
All right.

1277
01:48:28,117 --> 01:48:31,204
Shikamaru, stay here with Shiho
and wait for word from us.

1278
01:48:32,114 --> 01:48:35,034
I guess I have no choice
since I can't move.

1279
01:48:36,069 --> 01:48:37,320
Okay, Katsuyu.

1280
01:48:37,498 --> 01:48:41,210
Get word of this to every
able survivor in the village.

1281
01:48:41,771 --> 01:48:43,522
We'll need their help.

1282
01:48:44,186 --> 01:48:45,938
Yes, I understand.

1283
01:48:47,270 --> 01:48:50,649
You argue that my vision
of peace is a fake.

1284
01:48:51,191 --> 01:48:53,568
But in this cursed world,
there is nothing more fictional

1285
01:48:53,610 --> 01:48:57,197
than a peace where people can
truly understand one another.

1286
01:48:58,323 --> 01:49:01,034
Pervy Sage believed that the day
would come

1287
01:49:01,059 --> 01:49:03,269
when people truly understand
one another.

1288
01:49:03,578 --> 01:49:04,871
You're wrong!

1289
01:49:05,622 --> 01:49:06,873
Empty words...

1290
01:49:07,332 --> 01:49:10,293
What can you do when you can't
even back up your answer?

1291
01:49:10,504 --> 01:49:12,214
All you are good for...

1292
01:49:13,630 --> 01:49:16,216
-... is giving me the power
-... is giving me the power

1293
01:49:16,258 --> 01:49:17,592
of the Nine-Tails.

1294
01:49:21,187 --> 01:49:22,480
Like I told you earlier...

1295
01:49:22,973 --> 01:49:26,935
your death will lead to peace.

1296
01:49:34,192 --> 01:49:36,903
<i>I can feel...
Pain's chakra coming inside...</i>

1297
01:49:37,779 --> 01:49:40,240
I've avoided any vital spots
and kept them shallow.

1298
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:43,743
But you will no longer be able
to move on your own.

1299
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:46,109
Snap out of it, Lad!

1300
01:49:47,534 --> 01:49:51,454
No matter what he says,
you must not listen!

1301
01:49:52,227 --> 01:49:53,812
You're the Child of Prophecy!

1302
01:49:54,313 --> 01:49:56,023
The savior of this world!

1303
01:49:56,590 --> 01:50:01,219
Jiraiya-boy and Pa sacrificed themselves
because they believed that!

1304
01:50:01,542 --> 01:50:04,337
So you cannot lose!

1305
01:50:04,681 --> 01:50:07,726
If you give up now,
I won't forgive you!

1306
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:11,563
Noisy frog.

1307
01:50:11,824 --> 01:50:12,825
Bastard!

1308
01:50:13,588 --> 01:50:16,216
I guess I'll be taking you now...

1309
01:50:31,708 --> 01:50:32,709
Lady Hinata!

1310
01:50:38,632 --> 01:50:39,633
<i>How cruel...</i>

1311
01:50:40,300 --> 01:50:43,386
<i>Restricting Naruto's movement
with those poles.</i>

1312
01:50:44,220 --> 01:50:46,014
I won't let you hurt Naruto anymore!

1313
01:50:47,515 --> 01:50:48,850
Reinforcements?

1314
01:50:49,434 --> 01:50:51,061
Why'd you come out here?!

1315
01:50:51,561 --> 01:50:53,813
Get away quickly! You're no match...

1316
01:50:53,838 --> 01:50:54,839
I know.

1317
01:50:55,774 --> 01:50:58,151
I'm just being... selfish.

1318
01:50:58,652 --> 01:50:59,819
What are you talking about?!

1319
01:51:00,111 --> 01:51:03,365
Don't put yourself in danger like this!

1320
01:51:04,908 --> 01:51:07,661
I'm here because I want to be.

1321
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:10,205
This time...

1322
01:51:10,246 --> 01:51:11,998
I'm going to save you, Naruto.

1323
01:51:15,794 --> 01:51:18,672
I was always crying,
and giving up before even trying.

1324
01:51:19,214 --> 01:51:21,341
I made the wrong turns
so many times...

1325
01:51:22,759 --> 01:51:26,680
But you helped me find my way
and take the correct path, Naruto.

1326
01:51:28,306 --> 01:51:30,225
I always chased after you.

1327
01:51:30,934 --> 01:51:32,519
I wanted to catch up to you.

1328
01:51:34,354 --> 01:51:37,148
I wanted to walk
beside you all the time.

1329
01:51:37,899 --> 01:51:39,609
I want to be at your side, always.

1330
01:51:41,194 --> 01:51:43,154
You changed me, Naruto!

1331
01:51:44,823 --> 01:51:47,701
Your smile is what saved me!

1332
01:51:49,351 --> 01:51:52,354
That's why I'm not afraid to die...

1333
01:51:52,527 --> 01:51:54,529
if it means I can protect you!

1334
01:52:00,004 --> 01:52:01,089
Because...

1335
01:52:01,506 --> 01:52:03,967
I love you, Naruto!

1336
01:52:37,508 --> 01:52:38,509
What?

1337
01:52:50,138 --> 01:52:51,139
Hinata!

1338
01:53:04,486 --> 01:53:06,196
<i>I can't get near Naruto...</i>

1339
01:53:06,529 --> 01:53:07,739
<i>I must do something!</i>

1340
01:53:25,738 --> 01:53:27,072
<i>I can't let it end like this.</i>

1341
01:53:27,634 --> 01:53:30,303
<i>If there's even the slightest chance...</i>

1342
01:53:31,765 --> 01:53:33,725
<i>Gentle Step: Twin Lion Fists!</i>

1343
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:53,201
Nagato!

1344
01:53:56,371 --> 01:53:57,372
<i>Now's my chance!</i>

1345
01:54:02,293 --> 01:54:03,503
<i>One more time!</i>

1346
01:54:12,078 --> 01:54:13,872
Hinata!

1347
01:54:15,807 --> 01:54:18,685
<i>I want to become a great ninja...</i>

1348
01:54:18,977 --> 01:54:22,981
<i>strong like Father and
kind like Mother.</i>

1349
01:54:24,899 --> 01:54:28,236
If you're the Hyuga girl,
show us your Byakugan!

1350
01:54:28,570 --> 01:54:30,864
If you don't want to,
then don't look our way!

1351
01:54:31,155 --> 01:54:33,408
Your eyes are creepy!

1352
01:54:33,533 --> 01:54:35,535
I bet you're actually
a monster, right?

1353
01:54:35,535 --> 01:54:37,745
Yeah, you Byakugan monster!

1354
01:54:43,668 --> 01:54:44,794
Hey! Cut it out!

1355
01:54:46,504 --> 01:54:48,214
- Huh?
- Who are you?

1356
01:54:49,257 --> 01:54:50,383
I'm Naruto Uzumaki!

1357
01:54:51,468 --> 01:54:53,053
The future Hokage!

1358
01:54:53,403 --> 01:54:55,280
The future Hokage?

1359
01:54:55,388 --> 01:54:57,056
Are you stupid?

1360
01:54:57,056 --> 01:54:58,148
Get ready!

1361
01:54:58,424 --> 01:54:59,812
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

1362
01:55:05,159 --> 01:55:06,744
<i>Come at me!</i>

1363
01:55:06,769 --> 01:55:07,440
<i>Yeah!</i>

1364
01:55:14,365 --> 01:55:15,366
Why you!

1365
01:55:22,707 --> 01:55:24,375
I knocked him out!

1366
01:55:24,667 --> 01:55:26,544
Future Hokage, yeah right!

1367
01:55:26,893 --> 01:55:28,394
- Wearing a red scarf...
- Yahoo!

1368
01:55:28,421 --> 01:55:30,214
Thinking it makes him look cool!

1369
01:55:35,094 --> 01:55:36,596
Hold it, hold it!

1370
01:55:36,804 --> 01:55:39,432
This time,
I'll do a super-duper jutsu and—?

1371
01:55:41,392 --> 01:55:42,852
Oww...

1372
01:55:42,852 --> 01:55:44,812
Are you okay?

1373
01:55:45,719 --> 01:55:47,304
It's nothing...

1374
01:55:48,524 --> 01:55:50,735
Your scarf...
Those boys...

1375
01:55:53,696 --> 01:55:54,906
I'm sorry...

1376
01:55:54,931 --> 01:55:55,973
Don't worry about it.

1377
01:55:59,202 --> 01:56:00,578
U-Um...

1378
01:56:00,745 --> 01:56:01,746
Huh?

1379
01:56:01,996 --> 01:56:05,416
Th-Thank you very much.

1380
01:56:07,251 --> 01:56:08,252
See ya!

1381
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:19,305
<i>Hinata!</i>

1382
01:56:19,681 --> 01:56:20,765
<i>Hinata!</i>

1383
01:56:22,308 --> 01:56:23,101
<i>Hey!</i>

1384
01:56:23,309 --> 01:56:24,310
<i>Damn it...</i>

1385
01:56:24,811 --> 01:56:25,979
<i>Hinata!</i>

1386
01:56:31,526 --> 01:56:32,527
Hinata!

1387
01:56:54,424 --> 01:56:55,425
Stop...

1388
01:56:56,275 --> 01:56:58,110
Don't come, Hinata.

1389
01:57:03,200 --> 01:57:05,077
<i>I'm not running away!</i>

1390
01:57:07,619 --> 01:57:10,164
<i>It's impossible to change yourself.</i>

1391
01:57:10,189 --> 01:57:13,192
<i>Sure she can! Don't go deciding
what a person is like!</i>

1392
01:57:16,612 --> 01:57:18,573
<i>Go, Hinata!</i>

1393
01:57:20,825 --> 01:57:24,954
<i>I always thought you were
so negative, hesitant, and weird.</i>

1394
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:33,296
<i>But I kind of like people like you.</i>

1395
01:57:58,488 --> 01:57:59,655
I don't understand.

1396
01:58:00,865 --> 01:58:05,161
Why would someone weak
like you try to resist?

1397
01:58:09,290 --> 01:58:10,792
Why fight me?

1398
01:58:14,861 --> 01:58:17,614
Knowing... that you'll die?

1399
01:58:28,192 --> 01:58:31,695
- I stand by what I say.
<i>- I stand by what I say.</i>

1400
01:58:39,827 --> 01:58:44,332
Because that's... my Ninja Way...

1401
01:59:01,658 --> 01:59:04,202
It was just like this...

1402
01:59:05,221 --> 01:59:08,850
My parents were killed
before my very eyes

1403
01:59:09,725 --> 01:59:12,937
by ninja from the Hidden Leaf.

1404
01:59:14,730 --> 01:59:19,777
Out of love, sacrifice is born...

1405
01:59:21,112 --> 01:59:23,156
Hate is born...

1406
01:59:23,948 --> 01:59:27,451
and we are able to know pain.

1407
01:59:54,145 --> 01:59:55,897
Do you hate me?

1408
01:59:59,358 --> 02:00:02,069
It's responding to Naruto's rage.

1409
02:01:36,205 --> 02:01:40,626
Do you still think people can
truly understand one another?

1410
02:02:10,197 --> 02:02:11,741
Your actions are justified.

1411
02:02:13,159 --> 02:02:14,535
But know this...

1412
02:02:15,177 --> 02:02:19,223
My pain is far greater than yours!

1413
02:02:41,896 --> 02:02:42,897
Let's go!

1414
02:03:21,513 --> 02:03:22,890
Is that all you've got?

1415
02:03:30,319 --> 02:03:31,320
Not bad.

1416
02:04:30,212 --> 02:04:31,755
A Sealing Jutsu?

1417
02:04:41,110 --> 02:04:42,445
<i>He broke the Seal...</i>

1418
02:04:49,079 --> 02:04:49,915
<i>Here he comes!</i>

1419
02:05:00,326 --> 02:05:01,327
<i>He's fast!</i>

1420
02:05:13,214 --> 02:05:14,965
<i>Almighty Push!</i>

1421
02:05:30,523 --> 02:05:31,524
<i>Impossible...</i>

1422
02:05:31,815 --> 02:05:34,568
<i>He withstood my Almighty Push!</i>

1423
02:06:05,683 --> 02:06:07,059
Naruto.

1424
02:06:26,161 --> 02:06:27,746
<i>Universal Pull!</i>

1425
02:06:44,490 --> 02:06:45,491
What was that?!

1426
02:06:48,225 --> 02:06:50,394
Oh my god... What is that?

1427
02:06:51,145 --> 02:06:52,855
How is Naruto doing?

1428
02:06:53,606 --> 02:06:54,940
How can I put it?

1429
02:06:56,525 --> 02:06:59,111
Naruto is showing
six tails right now.

1430
02:06:59,783 --> 02:07:02,369
At this rate, he may end up
transforming into the Nine-Tails.

1431
02:07:03,402 --> 02:07:04,403
<i>Six tails?!</i>

1432
02:07:05,075 --> 02:07:08,412
<i>Six... It's much worse
than last time!</i>

1433
02:07:09,663 --> 02:07:13,417
Lady Katsuyu. Please tell everyone
to evacuate immediately.

1434
02:07:16,545 --> 02:07:17,546
Did you find Kabuto?

1435
02:07:20,132 --> 02:07:21,133
Yes.

1436
02:07:21,467 --> 02:07:23,344
Good. Don't let him spot you.

1437
02:07:25,929 --> 02:07:27,389
Wh-What?!

1438
02:07:28,432 --> 02:07:29,433
What is it?

1439
02:07:30,490 --> 02:07:33,692
It can't be... He undid
the Sealing Jutsu on his own!

1440
02:07:34,188 --> 02:07:35,773
Six Tails?! That's insane!

1441
02:07:37,149 --> 02:07:38,150
There's an emergency.

1442
02:07:38,901 --> 02:07:41,362
Sorry, but I must return to the village!

1443
02:07:41,487 --> 02:07:42,780
H-Hey!

1444
02:07:52,122 --> 02:07:53,624
<i>The power of the Nine-Tails...</i>

1445
02:07:54,708 --> 02:07:56,377
<i>How magnificent.</i>

1446
02:08:48,512 --> 02:08:50,931
I've brought Tendo close enough.

1447
02:08:53,194 --> 02:08:54,529
You don't have to go that far.

1448
02:08:55,644 --> 02:08:57,438
Your body can't take anymore.

1449
02:08:58,564 --> 02:09:02,651
Silence, Konan. I must focus.

1450
02:09:16,373 --> 02:09:17,958
<i>Planetary Devastation!</i>

1451
02:11:36,597 --> 02:11:38,640
Why did you push yourself
to make it that huge?

1452
02:11:40,517 --> 02:11:42,477
My opponent is the Nine-Tails.

1453
02:11:43,395 --> 02:11:44,479
I cannot ease up.

1454
02:11:45,520 --> 02:11:50,150
The Sage of the Six Paths is
said to have created the moon.

1455
02:11:51,153 --> 02:11:52,779
This is nothing compared to that.

1456
02:11:54,604 --> 02:11:55,605
Regardless...

1457
02:11:56,325 --> 02:11:59,202
I have now captured the Nine-Tails.

1458
02:12:08,128 --> 02:12:09,129
<i>Why?</i>

1459
02:12:10,797 --> 02:12:13,216
<i>Why did it come to this?</i>

1460
02:12:14,092 --> 02:12:18,639
<i>How would you confront this hatred,
in order to create peace?</i>

1461
02:12:20,515 --> 02:12:22,559
<i>I want to hear your answer.</i>

1462
02:12:25,228 --> 02:12:27,981
<i>How should I know?</i>

1463
02:12:29,399 --> 02:12:32,194
<i>It hurts... I hate this.</i>

1464
02:12:41,244 --> 02:12:42,454
<i>I don't know...</i>

1465
02:12:43,138 --> 02:12:44,806
<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>

1466
02:12:46,875 --> 02:12:49,002
<i>I don't know anything anymore!</i>

1467
02:12:50,943 --> 02:12:52,862
<i>Someone, help me...</i>

1468
02:12:54,633 --> 02:12:57,219
<i>Give me the answer.</i>

1469
02:12:58,804 --> 02:13:01,181
<i>Destroy everything.</i>

1470
02:13:02,265 --> 02:13:05,143
<i>Erase everything that hurts.</i>

1471
02:13:06,103 --> 02:13:10,107
<i>Give me your soul.</i>

1472
02:13:11,160 --> 02:13:16,707
<i>I will save you from your suffering.</i>

1473
02:13:44,019 --> 02:13:46,980
<i>Yes... You're doing fine.</i>

1474
02:13:50,997 --> 02:13:53,208
Eight?! This is bad.

1475
02:13:53,442 --> 02:13:55,152
This is really, really bad!

1476
02:14:06,621 --> 02:14:08,290
I never imagined it would
be this powerful.

1477
02:14:33,774 --> 02:14:35,776
<i>Come over here.</i>

1478
02:14:37,518 --> 02:14:38,561
<i>Come...</i>

1479
02:14:39,112 --> 02:14:43,075
<i>Rip this Seal off me.</i>

1480
02:14:52,883 --> 02:14:54,718
Damn it... It's too late.

1481
02:14:56,445 --> 02:14:58,364
How could this happen?

1482
02:15:58,483 --> 02:15:59,985
<i>You're...</i>

1483
02:16:06,867 --> 02:16:10,912
Fourth... Hokage...

1484
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:16,793
I worked it into the seal spell

1485
02:16:16,818 --> 02:16:18,945
so that I would appear within
your psyche,

1486
02:16:18,970 --> 02:16:23,266
should the seal be broken to the point
you sprouted the eighth tail.

1487
02:16:24,718 --> 02:16:27,762
I really wanted to avoid that...

1488
02:16:29,306 --> 02:16:32,642
Since I had no desire to see
you again... Nine-Tails.

1489
02:16:35,896 --> 02:16:36,897
Then again...

1490
02:16:40,297 --> 02:16:44,510
I did look forward to seeing
my son as a young man.

1491
02:16:45,280 --> 02:16:46,698
So I'll call it even.

1492
02:16:47,199 --> 02:16:50,202
<i>Fourth Hokage!</i>

1493
02:16:50,994 --> 02:16:53,955
<i>Come here!
I'll rip you to shreds!</i>

1494
02:16:54,333 --> 02:16:57,211
Well, if that's the case,
I'll stay away.

1495
02:16:58,293 --> 02:16:59,794
Right, Naruto?

1496
02:17:00,795 --> 02:17:03,423
Naruto... My name...

1497
02:17:04,382 --> 02:17:05,101
Hm?

1498
02:17:05,421 --> 02:17:08,633
Well... I'm the one who named you.

1499
02:17:09,140 --> 02:17:10,307
You are my son, after all.

1500
02:17:11,060 --> 02:17:14,605
Son? Then... I'm...

1501
02:17:15,518 --> 02:17:16,259
Yes.

1502
02:17:17,896 --> 02:17:20,690
You heard me.
You're my son.

1503
02:17:34,496 --> 02:17:36,998
<i>Fourth Hokage!</i>

1504
02:17:37,249 --> 02:17:39,167
Loud fellow, isn't he?

1505
02:17:39,657 --> 02:17:41,242
Let's go somewhere quiet.

1506
02:17:50,470 --> 02:17:53,431
Third Hokage didn't tell you much
of anything, did he?

1507
02:17:53,890 --> 02:17:57,644
I suppose he wanted to conceal
the truth about the Nine-Tails.

1508
02:17:58,561 --> 02:18:02,190
If people had found out you were
my son, you'd have been in danger.

1509
02:18:03,445 --> 02:18:04,446
Dad...

1510
02:18:10,073 --> 02:18:13,827
Why did you seal the Nine-Tails
inside your own son?!

1511
02:18:13,965 --> 02:18:17,052
Do you know what I went
through because of that?!

1512
02:18:17,205 --> 02:18:20,458
All the grown-ups looked
at me with contempt...

1513
02:18:20,500 --> 02:18:22,544
And I couldn't make any friends.

1514
02:18:22,622 --> 02:18:26,251
I wanted people to accept me,

1515
02:18:26,478 --> 02:18:28,689
so I trained really hard
to become strong.

1516
02:18:28,758 --> 02:18:32,385
Then I met Iruka-sensei, and
Kakashi-sensei, and Pervy Sage...

1517
02:18:32,410 --> 02:18:34,746
And I was happy because
they helped make me stronger!

1518
02:18:34,889 --> 02:18:38,601
But because of that, a group called
the Akatsuki came after me,

1519
02:18:38,643 --> 02:18:41,563
so I trained really hard...

1520
02:18:41,885 --> 02:18:45,973
I became even stronger,
but the Akatsuki still killed my friends.

1521
02:18:46,067 --> 02:18:48,621
But... huh?
What am I saying?

1522
02:18:48,712 --> 02:18:51,214
Damn it, am I supposed
to be happy or mad?!

1523
02:18:51,239 --> 02:18:52,991
I don't know anymore!

1524
02:18:56,786 --> 02:18:59,289
Naruto... How old are you now?

1525
02:19:02,178 --> 02:19:03,387
Sixteen.

1526
02:19:03,962 --> 02:19:06,631
Wow... You're already
sixteen years old, huh?

1527
02:19:07,464 --> 02:19:09,966
It must have been hard for you...

1528
02:19:09,991 --> 02:19:12,285
I'm sorry, Naruto.

1529
02:19:13,636 --> 02:19:17,724
I suppose after putting
my own son through so much...

1530
02:19:18,016 --> 02:19:21,061
I have no right to act like
a father and apologize.

1531
02:19:23,026 --> 02:19:24,778
It's all right... already.

1532
02:19:25,357 --> 02:19:30,195
I'm the son... of the Fourth Hokage...
I can handle this.

1533
02:19:33,239 --> 02:19:36,993
I sealed half of the Nine-Tails' chakra
inside of you,

1534
02:19:37,160 --> 02:19:39,746
because I believed
you could control its power.

1535
02:19:41,998 --> 02:19:43,583
Because you are my son.

1536
02:19:47,420 --> 02:19:50,924
And there is a reason why I did this.

1537
02:19:52,967 --> 02:19:56,388
When the Nine-Tails attacked
the village sixteen years ago,

1538
02:19:56,689 --> 02:19:57,847
I learned something.

1539
02:19:58,390 --> 02:19:59,391
What?

1540
02:19:59,872 --> 02:20:03,900
There was a mastermind who unleashed
the Nine-Tails on the village.

1541
02:20:04,323 --> 02:20:05,199
Mastermind?

1542
02:20:05,270 --> 02:20:07,522
A powerful ninja at that.

1543
02:20:08,284 --> 02:20:11,537
It would require a special kind of power
to go up against such an opponent.

1544
02:20:12,695 --> 02:20:15,198
I believe he will attack our village again.

1545
02:20:20,388 --> 02:20:24,100
The Leaf Village
has already been destroyed.

1546
02:20:25,132 --> 02:20:28,886
Yes... I watched from inside you.

1547
02:20:29,755 --> 02:20:31,965
You watched?!

1548
02:20:32,465 --> 02:20:34,592
I know about Jiraiya-sensei too.

1549
02:20:37,804 --> 02:20:42,016
Then was it Pain who used the Nine-Tails
to attack the village before?

1550
02:20:42,267 --> 02:20:44,727
No... It wasn't him.

1551
02:20:44,894 --> 02:20:46,062
Then who was it?!

1552
02:20:47,188 --> 02:20:48,690
One of the Akatsuki.

1553
02:20:49,034 --> 02:20:50,786
The Masked Man.

1554
02:20:51,651 --> 02:20:55,363
Back then...
he saw through every move I made.

1555
02:20:56,114 --> 02:20:57,449
He's no ordinary ninja.

1556
02:20:59,175 --> 02:21:02,261
This man is probably just using Pain.

1557
02:21:02,450 --> 02:21:05,912
No! Pain had a grudge
against the Hidden Leaf!

1558
02:21:06,186 --> 02:21:09,231
He said, long ago, his own village
was wiped out like ours!

1559
02:21:09,669 --> 02:21:11,087
That's right.

1560
02:21:11,588 --> 02:21:13,381
Because of that hatred,
he's being used.

1561
02:21:14,048 --> 02:21:17,177
Used?! A guy as strong as him?!

1562
02:21:18,009 --> 02:21:20,928
And what about
this mastermind masked ninja?

1563
02:21:21,055 --> 02:21:23,850
Why is everyone attacking the Leaf?

1564
02:21:25,018 --> 02:21:27,937
Perhaps as long as there is
a ninja system in this world,

1565
02:21:27,979 --> 02:21:30,231
there can be no peace.

1566
02:21:31,441 --> 02:21:33,985
Pain questioned you about peace...

1567
02:21:34,486 --> 02:21:36,488
But finding the answer is difficult.

1568
02:21:38,847 --> 02:21:40,724
You must find the answer yourself.

1569
02:21:41,560 --> 02:21:43,979
I do not have the answer.

1570
02:21:44,646 --> 02:21:49,275
If Pervy Sage and you don't know
the answer, how am I to know?!

1571
02:21:49,792 --> 02:21:51,961
Everyone expects too much!

1572
02:21:52,337 --> 02:21:54,464
I'm not smart!

1573
02:21:54,489 --> 02:21:56,605
And I'm not a great ninja!

1574
02:21:57,090 --> 02:21:58,549
And...

1575
02:22:00,285 --> 02:22:02,912
I know you'll find the answer.

1576
02:22:06,809 --> 02:22:08,728
I have faith in you.

1577
02:22:18,238 --> 02:22:19,239
Really?

1578
02:22:19,447 --> 02:22:21,366
You really believe I can do it?

1579
02:22:22,325 --> 02:22:26,412
To be a parent is to have
undying faith in one's child.

1580
02:22:29,086 --> 02:22:32,464
Now then... It's time for me to go.

1581
02:22:33,753 --> 02:22:35,505
My chakra's fading.

1582
02:22:35,922 --> 02:22:36,923
Huh?!

1583
02:22:37,116 --> 02:22:38,242
No, wait...

1584
02:22:42,303 --> 02:22:43,972
I will rebuild the seal.

1585
02:22:44,909 --> 02:22:46,828
However, this will be for the last time.

1586
02:22:50,859 --> 02:22:52,403
The Leaf can be rebuilt.

1587
02:22:53,773 --> 02:22:55,984
I'm counting on you... Naruto!

1588
02:23:05,823 --> 02:23:08,326
<i>Thanks... Dad!</i>

1589
02:23:14,930 --> 02:23:17,308
The Nine-Tails... disappeared?!

1590
02:23:31,583 --> 02:23:33,377
His doubt is gone...

1591
02:23:34,272 --> 02:23:35,565
What happened?

1592
02:23:36,249 --> 02:23:39,544
Does he now have control
over the Nine-Tails?

1593
02:23:45,015 --> 02:23:46,016
Nagato!

1594
02:24:16,872 --> 02:24:20,126
<i>The transformation into the Nine-Tails
disturbed my chakra.</i>

1595
02:24:20,985 --> 02:24:24,322
<i>It made me lose my Shadow Clone.</i>

1596
02:24:25,437 --> 02:24:29,775
<i>I can only use the Sage Jutsu Chakra
I have left inside of me.</i>

1597
02:24:41,146 --> 02:24:43,773
<i>He's already in Sage Mode.</i>

1598
02:24:44,440 --> 02:24:45,733
<i>He's tough.</i>

1599
02:24:46,473 --> 02:24:50,143
<i>I had to confirm the extent
of the Nine-Tails' power,</i>

1600
02:24:50,723 --> 02:24:53,101
<i>but I never imagined he could stop
my Planetary Devastation.</i>

1601
02:24:55,576 --> 02:24:57,077
I thought I was going to die!

1602
02:24:59,058 --> 02:25:00,226
What the...?

1603
02:25:02,772 --> 02:25:04,315
That's where the village is...

1604
02:25:05,571 --> 02:25:06,614
What happened?

1605
02:25:08,753 --> 02:25:11,006
You did it, Naruto, when you
were in the Nine-Tails state.

1606
02:25:12,311 --> 02:25:13,312
She's alive...

1607
02:25:13,812 --> 02:25:15,689
I can sense Hinata's chakra.

1608
02:25:16,548 --> 02:25:17,716
I was worried,

1609
02:25:18,584 --> 02:25:21,212
but no casualties resulted from
your assault

1610
02:25:21,379 --> 02:25:23,715
in the Nine-Tails state.

1611
02:25:24,674 --> 02:25:25,883
We were lucky.

1612
02:25:26,489 --> 02:25:29,200
I see.

1613
02:25:30,785 --> 02:25:32,954
It's time to settle this.

1614
02:25:42,948 --> 02:25:45,742
Have you come to understand
a little of what pain is?

1615
02:25:46,051 --> 02:25:50,889
Unless you know the same pain,
you cannot truly know another.

1616
02:25:51,350 --> 02:25:55,020
And even if you get to know others,
there can be no understanding.

1617
02:25:57,669 --> 02:25:59,630
That is the truth.

1618
02:26:01,261 --> 02:26:04,390
Just like how it's useless
to chase after Sasuke.

1619
02:26:06,545 --> 02:26:09,423
Take me to where the real Pain is!

1620
02:26:11,412 --> 02:26:13,686
I want to speak to you face-to-face.

1621
02:26:16,851 --> 02:26:20,438
Hmm... So you figured that out?

1622
02:26:21,272 --> 02:26:23,483
Jiraiya-sensei and now you...

1623
02:26:23,566 --> 02:26:25,943
You Leaf ninja are quite impressive.

1624
02:26:26,694 --> 02:26:29,280
However, our discussion is over.

1625
02:26:29,572 --> 02:26:32,742
Talking with you will change nothing.

1626
02:26:33,659 --> 02:26:35,661
Let me talk to him!

1627
02:26:36,245 --> 02:26:37,872
Sage Mode...

1628
02:26:39,040 --> 02:26:44,695
It seems you can only throw two of
those chakra shuriken. Isn't that so?

1629
02:26:45,171 --> 02:26:49,008
After that,
you will run out of Sage Mode!

1630
02:26:49,634 --> 02:26:52,136
I guess I have no choice
but to fight you!

1631
02:26:52,911 --> 02:26:57,124
If both of your shuriken miss,
you shall lose.

1632
02:26:58,184 --> 02:27:00,061
I will give you no more chances.

1633
02:27:00,440 --> 02:27:03,986
All that's left is to dodge your attack,
and drag your half-dead body away with me.

1634
02:27:04,955 --> 02:27:06,539
Too bad then...

1635
02:27:07,068 --> 02:27:08,986
I'll just look for the real Pain myself!

1636
02:27:10,488 --> 02:27:11,823
But how?

1637
02:27:12,156 --> 02:27:13,157
I have an idea.

1638
02:27:47,525 --> 02:27:48,526
Found you!

1639
02:27:53,698 --> 02:27:54,866
Bastard!

1640
02:27:58,703 --> 02:27:59,954
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

1641
02:28:05,167 --> 02:28:06,752
Now! Smoke bombs!

1642
02:28:07,253 --> 02:28:08,254
Right!

1643
02:28:11,924 --> 02:28:13,551
<i>Here comes the first shuriken.</i>

1644
02:28:16,929 --> 02:28:18,472
<i>Almighty Push!</i>

1645
02:28:19,765 --> 02:28:22,977
<i>What?! He had already launched the
second one using Shadow Shuriken Jutsu?!</i>

1646
02:28:24,186 --> 02:28:25,730
<i>His jutsu interval is five seconds!</i>

1647
02:28:25,971 --> 02:28:27,306
<i>I can do this!</i>

1648
02:28:47,168 --> 02:28:48,753
<i>Four seconds to go!</i>

1649
02:28:50,713 --> 02:28:53,758
<i>He was already standing by
with a Shadow Clone back then.</i>

1650
02:28:55,426 --> 02:28:59,013
<i>Three more seconds
until I can use my next jutsu.</i>

1651
02:29:00,181 --> 02:29:03,559
<i>But he missed both shots...</i>

1652
02:29:04,727 --> 02:29:06,062
<i>It's over.</i>

1653
02:29:11,233 --> 02:29:12,318
What?!

1654
02:29:12,693 --> 02:29:16,364
We still have two more seconds! Go!

1655
02:29:20,183 --> 02:29:23,812
<i>He had this many Shadow Clones
transformed into rubble?!</i>

1656
02:29:28,125 --> 02:29:29,335
<i>One more second!</i>

1657
02:29:35,116 --> 02:29:35,989
Zero!

1658
02:29:55,194 --> 02:29:57,113
He's now using Shadow Clones
as back up!

1659
02:29:59,657 --> 02:30:02,293
Someone like you who has no answer...

1660
02:30:02,318 --> 02:30:03,444
should just give up!

1661
02:30:05,788 --> 02:30:08,318
<i>But I have faith that</i>

1662
02:30:08,343 --> 02:30:12,514
<i>there will come a time when
people can truly understand one another.</i>

1663
02:30:12,962 --> 02:30:18,634
<i>And if I can't find the answer,
perhaps I will entrust you to find it.</i>

1664
02:30:19,260 --> 02:30:21,762
<i>I know you'll find the answer.</i>

1665
02:30:21,929 --> 02:30:23,639
<i>I have faith in you.</i>

1666
02:30:25,558 --> 02:30:30,187
<i>Only you can surpass
the Fourth Hokage.</i>

1667
02:30:30,354 --> 02:30:31,981
<i>I truly believe that.</i>

1668
02:30:38,320 --> 02:30:40,781
He withstood it... Impossible!

1669
02:30:51,292 --> 02:30:53,627
<i>That jutsu cannot be thrown.</i>

1670
02:30:53,794 --> 02:30:54,962
<i>I have five seconds.</i>

1671
02:30:55,421 --> 02:30:57,298
<i>This distance will work for me.</i>

1672
02:30:57,757 --> 02:31:00,676
Give up...

1673
02:31:04,680 --> 02:31:06,432
... on me giving up!

1674
02:31:06,640 --> 02:31:08,059
<i>Rasengan!</i>

1675
02:31:30,534 --> 02:31:31,493
Nagato...

1676
02:31:35,459 --> 02:31:38,921
The last Pain has been crushed.

1677
02:32:13,165 --> 02:32:16,669
Pain operated by receiving
chakra through these sticks.

1678
02:32:29,098 --> 02:32:30,808
Once it's taken out,

1679
02:32:30,833 --> 02:32:32,876
he shouldn't be able to move anymore.

1680
02:32:52,204 --> 02:32:54,540
<i>A cycle of hatred begins.</i>

1681
02:32:54,634 --> 02:32:56,761
<i>That is history as we know it.</i>

1682
02:32:57,084 --> 02:32:59,837
<i>So we cannot help but believe</i>

1683
02:32:59,862 --> 02:33:02,364
<i>that human beings are incapable
of understanding each other.</i>

1684
02:33:03,093 --> 02:33:07,764
<i>The world of the ninja
is ruled by hatred.</i>

1685
02:33:23,110 --> 02:33:24,320
You're going?

1686
02:33:24,862 --> 02:33:25,863
Yeah.

1687
02:33:26,197 --> 02:33:28,157
Then this time,
use reinforcements.

1688
02:33:28,199 --> 02:33:30,326
No.

1689
02:33:31,118 --> 02:33:32,411
I'm going alone!

1690
02:33:43,672 --> 02:33:44,798
Lady Hinata!

1691
02:33:49,803 --> 02:33:50,846
Everyone...

1692
02:33:50,870 --> 02:33:53,039
Thank goodness!
We were so worried.

1693
02:33:53,323 --> 02:33:55,242
Are you okay, Lady Hinata?

1694
02:34:00,272 --> 02:34:02,274
Thank you, everyone.

1695
02:34:03,359 --> 02:34:05,277
Thank you, Sakura.

1696
02:34:05,437 --> 02:34:08,482
I'm so relieved.
You overdid yourself this time.

1697
02:34:10,824 --> 02:34:14,495
Everyone, Naruto defeated
the sixth Pain.

1698
02:34:16,789 --> 02:34:18,874
Way to go Naruto!

1699
02:34:19,124 --> 02:34:21,835
How is Naruto? Is he hurt?

1700
02:34:22,211 --> 02:34:24,713
He's exhausted, but otherwise okay.

1701
02:34:27,383 --> 02:34:32,972
<i>Thank goodness...
Naruto, I'm so glad.</i>

1702
02:34:33,347 --> 02:34:35,474
So, where is Naruto?

1703
02:34:35,641 --> 02:34:38,644
He's going alone to
where the real Pain is.

1704
02:34:40,938 --> 02:34:42,940
Why would he do
something like that?!

1705
02:34:43,232 --> 02:34:45,317
Guy-sensei! We must follow!

1706
02:34:45,734 --> 02:34:46,735
Yes!

1707
02:34:46,760 --> 02:34:50,764
However... Naruto does not
want assistance.

1708
02:34:51,048 --> 02:34:52,758
Wh-What?!

1709
02:34:53,033 --> 02:34:55,411
No! Naruto's done enough on his own!

1710
02:34:55,513 --> 02:34:57,348
He's considerably weakened.

1711
02:34:57,663 --> 02:34:59,873
Please lead us to Naruto!

1712
02:35:07,339 --> 02:35:08,444
What is it?

1713
02:35:08,469 --> 02:35:09,595
It's Naruto...

1714
02:35:17,119 --> 02:35:18,370
Naruto!

1715
02:35:24,047 --> 02:35:25,090
Guys...

1716
02:35:27,459 --> 02:35:29,753
The fact that you're here...

1717
02:35:29,778 --> 02:35:32,114
Does it mean that
you've defeated the sixth Pain?

1718
02:35:38,579 --> 02:35:42,374
It doesn't matter who won or lost.

1719
02:35:49,798 --> 02:35:51,467
What happened?

1720
02:35:52,760 --> 02:35:55,012
I can't really put it into words.

1721
02:35:56,750 --> 02:36:00,463
What do you mean...
you can't put it into words?

1722
02:36:02,353 --> 02:36:06,607
Look, I'm going to see the real Pain.

1723
02:36:07,816 --> 02:36:12,613
Please don't follow.
I want to go alone.

1724
02:36:14,239 --> 02:36:16,742
I want to talk to the real Pain.

1725
02:36:17,306 --> 02:36:20,851
What?! You're talking nonsense!

1726
02:36:21,392 --> 02:36:24,270
We're all grateful that
you've defeated Pain.

1727
02:36:24,295 --> 02:36:28,007
But it's far too late to
settle things with words!

1728
02:36:28,712 --> 02:36:29,922
Then tell me!

1729
02:36:29,963 --> 02:36:31,840
If we destroy the real Pain,
and his minions,

1730
02:36:31,882 --> 02:36:34,093
and the village and everything else
connected to the enemy,

1731
02:36:34,134 --> 02:36:35,719
will that "settle" things?!

1732
02:36:35,761 --> 02:36:37,763
What good will talking do?

1733
02:36:37,971 --> 02:36:40,891
He is our enemy who
destroyed the Leaf Village!

1734
02:36:41,100 --> 02:36:42,893
We cannot forgive him!

1735
02:36:42,996 --> 02:36:46,166
I know! I know!
I feel the same way!

1736
02:36:46,563 --> 02:36:48,857
How can I forgive
a guy like that

1737
02:36:48,899 --> 02:36:51,276
who did this to our village
and its people?!

1738
02:36:51,318 --> 02:36:53,237
- Then...
- Inoichi...

1739
02:36:55,697 --> 02:36:59,576
Let's do as Naruto says
and let him go alone.

1740
02:37:00,059 --> 02:37:01,643
Shikaku...

1741
02:37:03,205 --> 02:37:05,582
It is Naruto who stopped Pain.

1742
02:37:05,624 --> 02:37:08,419
He has every right to speak to Pain.

1743
02:37:09,804 --> 02:37:13,266
Besides, I'm sure he has his reasons.

1744
02:37:13,424 --> 02:37:14,410
But...

1745
02:37:14,435 --> 02:37:16,645
Just let him go.

1746
02:37:19,780 --> 02:37:22,199
Thanks, Mister Shikaku.

1747
02:37:27,396 --> 02:37:30,649
Why did you let Naruto
go by himself, Shikaku?

1748
02:37:33,527 --> 02:37:34,987
It's my son...

1749
02:37:35,362 --> 02:37:36,447
Your son?

1750
02:37:42,870 --> 02:37:44,538
Where were you?

1751
02:37:44,580 --> 02:37:46,748
Black Ops sent a message for you.

1752
02:37:47,458 --> 02:37:51,503
Well... I went to lecture Naruto...

1753
02:37:52,171 --> 02:37:54,256
to stop him from acting glum.

1754
02:37:56,175 --> 02:37:59,386
It was a pain,
but I couldn't help myself.

1755
02:38:06,680 --> 02:38:10,434
He's got something
that we don't have.

1756
02:38:11,023 --> 02:38:12,191
"Something"?

1757
02:38:12,691 --> 02:38:18,989
Yeah... Someday, he's going to become
a very important ninja to this village.

1758
02:38:20,741 --> 02:38:22,576
When I'm with Naruto...

1759
02:38:23,151 --> 02:38:28,460
he makes me want to follow him.

1760
02:38:31,877 --> 02:38:35,714
Shikamaru, who rarely praises people,
said that to me.

1761
02:38:36,698 --> 02:38:39,368
There really must be something
special about Naruto.

1762
02:38:39,510 --> 02:38:40,969
I want to believe so.

1763
02:38:44,890 --> 02:38:47,518
Let's put our faith in Naruto.

1764
02:39:15,087 --> 02:39:16,588
Konan, get back.

1765
02:39:17,089 --> 02:39:18,382
But Nagato...

1766
02:39:18,757 --> 02:39:19,967
It's all right.

1767
02:39:28,725 --> 02:39:31,311
Are you the real Pain?

1768
02:39:43,180 --> 02:39:46,099
So, peace has come to me.
