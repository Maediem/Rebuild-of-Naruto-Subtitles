1
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,023
Do you hate me?

2
00:01:47,622 --> 00:01:50,372
You're facing the object
of your vendetta...

3
00:01:50,397 --> 00:01:52,566
Do you wish to exact revenge?

4
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,743
<i>A cycle of hatred begins.</i>

5
00:01:59,842 --> 00:02:05,181
<i>I formed the Akatsuki in order
to stop this cycle of hatred.</i>

6
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,879
Nothing in this world will change

7
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:13,883
even if you kill Pain now
and exact your revenge.

8
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,386
All it will be is self-satisfaction.

9
00:02:18,007 --> 00:02:21,546
If you could not find the answer,

10
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:23,760
then there is nothing you can do,

11
00:02:23,785 --> 00:02:26,376
but to do the just thing
and sacrifice yourself

12
00:02:26,401 --> 00:02:29,237
for the peace which I am
about to create.

13
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,373
At this close distance,

14
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:49,652
I can easily control your movements
with my chakra.

15
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,590
Rest assured.
I've avoided hitting your vital spots.

16
00:02:54,236 --> 00:02:56,905
For you are invaluable, Jinchuriki.

17
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,693
What's wrong, Nagato?

18
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:22,493
<i>He... purposely didn't move.</i>

19
00:03:23,074 --> 00:03:26,953
I came here...
intending to talk to you.

20
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:31,169
But, I also wanted to
confirm something.

21
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,756
Confirm... something?

22
00:03:37,111 --> 00:03:39,655
I wanted to confirm my feelings.

23
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,189
If I stood before my enemy...

24
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:45,266
what would I do?

25
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,477
I wasn't sure of myself.

26
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,508
And?

27
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,446
I can't forgive you!

28
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,431
Even now, I want to kill you so badly...

29
00:04:00,456 --> 00:04:02,166
I can't stop shaking!

30
00:04:07,036 --> 00:04:11,290
<i>What? He can resist Nagato's chakra
up close like this?!</i>

31
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,721
<i>I'm glad I made you my student.</i>

32
00:04:32,781 --> 00:04:36,535
Pervy Sage said he believed
that the day would come

33
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,062
when people can truly understand
one another.

34
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:45,243
I wasn't paying much attention
when he told me that...

35
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:50,208
Even when he said he'd entrust me
with finding the answer.

36
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,959
I got excited, taking it as a sign

37
00:04:52,984 --> 00:04:54,902
that he acknowledged me
as his student.

38
00:04:56,055 --> 00:04:57,556
Thinking back...

39
00:04:57,581 --> 00:05:00,292
I finally understand what
Pervy Sage meant.

40
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,544
That it's not so simple.

41
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:08,641
Still, it doesn't change the fact
that you can't forgive me.

42
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,019
Words of forgiveness come easy.

43
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,563
Love does not.

44
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:18,318
Yeah... You're right about that.

45
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:24,324
Jiraiya-sensei's words reflect
an idealism from an era long past.

46
00:05:24,564 --> 00:05:26,320
It is far removed from reality.

47
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:32,624
Didn't you say you would kill me
and bring peace to the ninja world?

48
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:43,300
Even if you seek vengeance
for your own satisfaction,

49
00:05:43,325 --> 00:05:45,827
if that is your idea of justice,
so be it.

50
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,640
You're not a god.

51
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,061
After witnessing this harsh reality,

52
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:58,175
do you really still believe
Jiraiya-sensei's silly ramblings?

53
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,988
When I found out you were
Pervy Sage's student,

54
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:06,969
I wanted to ask you one thing.

55
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,035
What is it?

56
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:13,790
How could a student of the Pervy Sage
turn out the way you did?

57
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:18,127
I understand that you're not
like the Akatsuki members

58
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:21,172
who kill out of sheer enjoyment.

59
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:26,219
But I don't know a thing
about you guys.

60
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,471
That's why...

61
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,600
I want to hear your stories,
then come up with an answer.

62
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:39,607
Fine. I will show you our pain.

63
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,026
Nagato! This is a waste of time!

64
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,653
Let's deal with him right now.

65
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,886
Wait, Konan...

66
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,949
I want to hear his answer.

67
00:06:49,987 --> 00:06:53,657
Besides, he won't go down so easily.

68
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:58,584
He crushed the six Pains
and made it here alone.

69
00:07:00,936 --> 00:07:03,604
Two moments define my greatest pain.

70
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,981
One is the death of my parents.

71
00:07:07,402 --> 00:07:09,328
It was when the Hidden Rain Village
became involved

72
00:07:09,353 --> 00:07:12,147
in the Great Nations' war and
was turned into a battlefield.

73
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,486
Found anything?

74
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,572
Yeah, some canned goods.

75
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,949
Our first meal in four days!

76
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,045
No, three days.

77
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,788
Who cares? Let's eat.
I won't last another minute.

78
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,291
Let's search the other places later.

79
00:07:38,656 --> 00:07:40,449
We might find more stuff.

80
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,504
Now's our chance to
make a run for it.

81
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:47,133
What if they see us? I'm scared.

82
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,597
Don't worry. Just be very quiet.

83
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:21,196
Who's there?!

84
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,422
Damn! Enemies?!

85
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,460
Run now!

86
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,843
Nagato, go!

87
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:42,313
Nagato...
Hurry... Get away...

88
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,985
Run, Nagato!

89
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,696
Run away! Hurry!

90
00:09:01,634 --> 00:09:04,971
Oh no... These people aren't ninja!

91
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,629
What'll we do?!

92
00:09:06,654 --> 00:09:08,322
Why did this happen?!

93
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,841
How could we mistake them
for the enemy?!

94
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,760
Damn it!

95
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:26,779
W-We didn't know there were still
any civilians in the war zone.

96
00:09:27,312 --> 00:09:28,985
I'm so sorry, kid.

97
00:09:52,253 --> 00:09:55,047
What? What happened?

98
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,222
Dad... Mom?

99
00:10:16,998 --> 00:10:21,419
Goodbye, Mom... Dad...

100
00:10:31,117 --> 00:10:32,832
This is the last that's left.

101
00:10:49,091 --> 00:10:51,636
<i>I'm too hungry to walk.</i>

102
00:11:06,784 --> 00:11:11,372
Thank you... If you didn't wake me up,
I'd probably be dead.

103
00:11:20,706 --> 00:11:24,627
Sorry... Even if you follow me,
I can't feed you.

104
00:11:26,155 --> 00:11:28,783
I don't have a thing to eat.

105
00:11:33,624 --> 00:11:38,295
Excuse me...
Can you spare some food for me?

106
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:39,748
I...

107
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:48,833
I haven't eaten in so long.

108
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,127
I'm sorry...

109
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,462
I have nothing to give you.

110
00:11:53,715 --> 00:11:57,844
Times are tough.
We barely have enough for ourselves.

111
00:11:58,193 --> 00:12:00,779
I'm really sorry,
but try somewhere else.

112
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:09,562
<i>But this was my last stop.</i>

113
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:38,591
<i>I can't go any further...
Am I going to die here?</i>

114
00:12:48,672 --> 00:12:50,674
Here... Eat this.

115
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:54,982
Are you sure?

116
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,567
Uh-huh...

117
00:13:01,631 --> 00:13:03,966
Konan, who are those two?

118
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,869
Sorry... They were on the verge of dying.

119
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,538
You even picked up a dog?

120
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:12,208
Seriously... What's it's name?

121
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,459
Chibi...

122
00:13:14,636 --> 00:13:16,972
You sure have a weird name!

123
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,341
No, I meant the dog.

124
00:13:21,195 --> 00:13:24,031
Wow... So much food...

125
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:28,866
If you intend to stay here,
I expect you to help find provisions too.

126
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,560
Provisions? How?

127
00:13:31,758 --> 00:13:33,677
- We steal.
- Steal?

128
00:13:34,035 --> 00:13:36,347
But... isn't that a bad thing?

129
00:13:36,372 --> 00:13:37,498
Are you stupid?

130
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:42,029
We live in hard times when
we have to fend for ourselves.

131
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,031
Pretty words are not enough
to get us by!

132
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:45,866
Pretty words...

133
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,746
Could you please give us some food?

134
00:13:50,771 --> 00:13:53,649
Just a little will do... please.

135
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,127
I don't have any fish to give out.
Now scram!

136
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,295
You stingy man!

137
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,256
What?! You rotten brat!

138
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:05,632
Ah! Hey!

139
00:14:06,203 --> 00:14:08,664
You stray dog! Stop!

140
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:11,519
My goodness! Huh?!

141
00:14:12,242 --> 00:14:13,285
Hey!

142
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:17,064
Where'd they go?!

143
00:14:18,651 --> 00:14:20,361
Good job, Chibi!

144
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,320
Hey! If you're not going to buy,
go away!

145
00:14:26,228 --> 00:14:27,190
Ow...

146
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,297
Shameless kids!

147
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,833
Next time, you won't get off so easy!

148
00:14:42,878 --> 00:14:47,966
Are you guys okay?
Well, these things happen.

149
00:14:48,447 --> 00:14:49,656
I guess...

150
00:14:49,898 --> 00:14:52,859
Nagato... Do you have a dream?

151
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:54,315
A dream?

152
00:14:55,265 --> 00:14:57,935
I don't intend to die in a place like this.

153
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,649
I have a huge dream!

154
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,528
World domination!

155
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,844
World domination?

156
00:15:07,869 --> 00:15:08,954
That's right!

157
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:11,363
If I rise to the top of the world,

158
00:15:11,388 --> 00:15:13,557
I'll never have to go through
this suffering again!

159
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:16,189
You think so?

160
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,854
Besides, if I were to die now,

161
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:21,882
I couldn't face Mom and Dad
who brought me into this world.

162
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:23,522
Right, Konan?

163
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,018
Uh-huh...

164
00:15:25,043 --> 00:15:28,088
If you conquer the world,
you can do whatever you please.

165
00:15:28,267 --> 00:15:31,353
That's just like being a god.

166
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,224
I wonder if you can stop the fighting too.

167
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,110
Are you all right?

168
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,488
Uh-huh...

169
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,709
Damn... What was that?!

170
00:16:00,675 --> 00:16:04,054
<i>Ninja are fighting so close.</i>

171
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:07,633
<i>It's Hanzo and the Hidden Leaf ninja!</i>

172
00:16:08,318 --> 00:16:09,260
Chibi!

173
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,036
Chibi is...

174
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:17,457
What'll I do, Yahiko?!
Chibi's not breathing!

175
00:16:17,482 --> 00:16:20,210
Worry about Chibi later!
First, we have to get away from here!

176
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,126
Chibi...

177
00:16:28,171 --> 00:16:29,401
Damn it!

178
00:16:30,103 --> 00:16:33,231
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

179
00:16:33,933 --> 00:16:35,267
Why?!

180
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,623
If the fighting doesn't stop...

181
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,044
I'll become the god of this world!

182
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:51,802
Nagato... Stop your crying!

183
00:16:52,808 --> 00:16:54,935
If all you do is cry after
you get beaten down,

184
00:16:55,003 --> 00:16:56,338
nothing will change!

185
00:16:56,533 --> 00:16:58,077
Just like this nation.

186
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,769
I'm going to change this nation!

187
00:17:01,112 --> 00:17:03,990
And for that, words aren't enough...
You need power!

188
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,776
Power?

189
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,353
We're going to learn ninjutsu!

190
00:17:10,378 --> 00:17:13,006
Ninjutsu? From who?

191
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:16,869
The Hidden Leaf ninja
who were fighting Hanzo.

192
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,205
I just went to the battle site.

193
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,875
I didn't see their corpses.

194
00:17:23,321 --> 00:17:26,199
They fought with Hanzo,
but they're still alive!

195
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,089
They must be amazingly strong!

196
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:30,924
But...

197
00:17:39,604 --> 00:17:41,856
I hate Hanzo!

198
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:45,606
He changed Hidden Rain Village
into a war zone like this.

199
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:50,861
Anyway, I'm going to become
a student of those strong ninja.

200
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,706
I'm going after them!

201
00:17:52,731 --> 00:17:55,775
What if you go after them and
find out they've been killed?

202
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,746
Then I'll look for whoever killed them.

203
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,170
Goodbye, Chibi.

204
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:21,700
Teach us ninjutsu.

205
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,977
You're all ninja from
the Hidden Leaf, right?

206
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:28,357
Thank you. This is for you.

207
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:31,360
Shall I kill these children?

208
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,445
Wha—?!

209
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:37,599
I've seen many war orphans.
It's pitiful.

210
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:42,530
They would be better off if we just
put them out of their misery right now.

211
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:44,015
Orochimaru, enough!

212
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:47,087
You go on ahead with Tsunade.

213
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,462
I'll stay here and
look after them for a while.

214
00:18:50,678 --> 00:18:51,679
Huh?!

215
00:18:52,308 --> 00:18:54,602
It is the least I can do.

216
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:58,070
- Thank you for the food!
- Thank you for the food!

217
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,931
Sensei! I'm getting the hang
of fishing!

218
00:19:00,956 --> 00:19:03,876
Oh yeah? You're becoming
more and more promising!

219
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:11,358
The four of us started living together.

220
00:19:12,028 --> 00:19:14,697
Soon after, a certain incident took place.

221
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,574
Yahiko!

222
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:24,037
<i>A straggler ninja attacked us
and nearly killed Yahiko.</i>

223
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,583
<i>That is when I struck out and
killed that ninja instead.</i>

224
00:19:34,204 --> 00:19:38,958
<i>As a result, Jiraiya-sensei, who had
been hesitant about training us,</i>

225
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,847
<i>began to teach us ninjutsu.</i>

226
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:46,560
<i>He said he was teaching us
so we could protect ourselves.</i>

227
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,478
<i>But I think, in my case,</i>

228
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:52,357
<i>it was so I could control
the power of the Rinnegan.</i>

229
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,946
<i>But I was afraid of my power.</i>

230
00:19:58,254 --> 00:20:01,341
<i>Hate had caused me to go berserk.</i>

231
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:05,996
<i>I thought what I did was wrong
and was consumed with guilt.</i>

232
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:12,252
<i>But Sensei pulled me from the depths.</i>

233
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,755
Is it about that incident?

234
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,177
That day...

235
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:25,474
When that man hurt Yahiko,
I was so mad at him.

236
00:20:26,965 --> 00:20:28,842
Everything went blank in my head.

237
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,812
I didn't know what I was doing.

238
00:20:32,495 --> 00:20:36,082
Before I realized it, the man was dead.

239
00:20:42,298 --> 00:20:45,135
After that, I got so scared.

240
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:50,040
This hatred made me lose myself...
and I killed someone.

241
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,126
What I did was wrong!

242
00:20:53,989 --> 00:20:56,188
There had to be a better way!

243
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,381
Nagato!

244
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:03,350
I really don't know if
it was right or wrong.

245
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:08,183
But thanks to you, Yahiko didn't die.

246
00:21:08,471 --> 00:21:10,223
You protected your friend.

247
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:14,773
That had to be the right thing to do.

248
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,278
No one can blame you for that.

249
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:25,367
<i>Before I realized it,
I had already accepted Sensei.</i>

250
00:21:27,802 --> 00:21:30,472
When you are hurt, you learn to hate.

251
00:21:31,344 --> 00:21:33,632
On the other hand, when you hurt someone,
you are resented.

252
00:21:33,657 --> 00:21:35,909
But you start to feel guilty as well.

253
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:43,677
However, understanding such pain
enables you to be kind to others.

254
00:21:44,941 --> 00:21:48,361
Knowing pain helps us to grow up,
to mature.

255
00:21:49,924 --> 00:21:52,509
And to grow up means
being able to think

256
00:21:52,534 --> 00:21:54,661
and make decisions on their own.

257
00:21:55,772 --> 00:22:00,902
To know and reflect on pain,
and come up with your own answer.

258
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:11,330
Jiraiya-sensei seemed to be
asking himself the same question.

259
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:15,776
He hadn't found an answer either.

260
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:20,571
Just like you haven't.

261
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:26,303
<i>Back then, I was able to come up
with an answer right away.</i>

262
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,098
I just want to protect those two.

263
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,103
No matter what kind of pain
I have to endure.

264
00:22:36,228 --> 00:22:37,229
I see.

265
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:43,862
What are you always pondering, Sensei?

266
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:46,740
There is so much war
in this world.

267
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:53,497
Only hatred exists.
I want to do something about it.

268
00:22:55,540 --> 00:23:00,670
And to know what the answer
to true peace is.

269
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,636
<i>Three years passed.</i>

270
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:12,307
<i>I felt that I had grown stronger
physically and mentally through training.</i>

271
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:17,771
<i>But Jiraiya-sensei's words always
kept coming back to me</i>

272
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,481
<i>from somewhere deep inside.</i>

273
00:23:21,536 --> 00:23:27,750
<i>Sensei had told me that perhaps
the answer rested in my Rinnegan.</i>

274
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:35,372
Long ago, people constantly fought.

275
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:40,335
Wars never ended.
It was an age far worse than today.

276
00:23:41,869 --> 00:23:45,498
In such an age, there appeared
a monk who, for the first time,

277
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:51,721
preached the truth of chakra and
tried to bring peace to the world.

278
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:56,101
It is said he traveled throughout
the world advocating his teachings,

279
00:23:56,126 --> 00:23:57,585
which he called ninshu.

280
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:03,233
Time passed and ninshu
became known as ninjutsu.

281
00:24:04,626 --> 00:24:07,087
Ninjutsu isn't about armed power.

282
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:10,574
It is a teaching that guides
people towards peace.

283
00:24:11,184 --> 00:24:14,229
This monk was known as
the Sage of the Six Paths

284
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:17,205
and was called the savior of this world.

285
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:21,251
Like you, he possessed the Rinnegan.

286
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,882
"We are the ones who
create peace and order."

287
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,718
Those are the monk's words.

288
00:24:31,031 --> 00:24:33,365
He must have believed that

289
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:36,852
the era would come when people
truly understood each other.

290
00:24:38,265 --> 00:24:43,292
Maybe... you are the reincarnation
of that monk.

291
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:49,379
I have a feeling that those eyes of yours
have been entrusted with the monk's hopes.

292
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:54,868
Sensei entrusted me with
the quest for peace,

293
00:24:55,103 --> 00:24:59,035
and then left us by ourselves.

294
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,335
Who are you?

295
00:25:04,647 --> 00:25:06,148
I am Madara Uchiha.

296
00:25:08,209 --> 00:25:09,210
Madara?

297
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:14,992
You're either a criminal or a total
idiot to claim the name Madara Uchiha.

298
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:19,267
Why'd you approach us?

299
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:21,042
The Rinnegan...

300
00:25:23,143 --> 00:25:25,311
To guide those who awaken it,
is the mission

301
00:25:25,336 --> 00:25:29,382
our organization has been
entrusted with since ages past.

302
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,906
You know about my eyes?

303
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,743
You are the reincarnation
of the Sage of Six Paths,

304
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:40,330
who dreamed of world peace
and stability.

305
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,251
Only the villages of large nations
are showered in light.

306
00:25:44,496 --> 00:25:49,214
Leaving your small country's village
in the shadow, dying.

307
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,968
That is why your eye
has awakened here.

308
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,681
Wherever light strikes,
there are always shadows.

309
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,368
So long as there is
a concept of victors...

310
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:03,021
the vanquished will also similarly exist.

311
00:26:03,955 --> 00:26:08,041
The selfish intent of wanting
to preserve peace initiates wars.

312
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:11,027
And hatred is born in order
to protect love.

313
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,824
These are all links in a causal
relationship that cannot be separated.

314
00:26:16,235 --> 00:26:21,508
But a world of just victors,
peace and love...

315
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:24,791
such a world can be created too.

316
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:29,504
If you allow us to collaborate,
you can learn how.

317
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:34,301
As soon as you attain
the true power of the Rinnegan...

318
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:37,621
Your very own world can
be immediately actualized.

319
00:26:38,503 --> 00:26:39,597
Now...

320
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,809
I can't do that.

321
00:26:44,012 --> 00:26:45,904
You're just trying to use us.

322
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:49,482
Your offer sounds way
too convenient.

323
00:26:52,117 --> 00:26:54,160
One can only reach
the true world

324
00:26:54,185 --> 00:26:58,702
after knowing another's pain
and shedding tears alongside them.

325
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,037
Shedding tears alongside them, huh?

326
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,872
You mean in revenge?

327
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:07,125
No, that's not what I meant.

328
00:27:07,588 --> 00:27:09,590
I meant in mutual understanding.

329
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:12,831
Stop talking so idealistically.

330
00:27:13,316 --> 00:27:15,568
No such thing exists
in this world.

331
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,345
Let's go, Konan... Nagato.

332
00:27:19,085 --> 00:27:20,753
We can't trust these guys!

333
00:27:23,149 --> 00:27:25,193
Don't you dare approach us again!

334
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,985
I'll wait here at
the same time every day.

335
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,667
You'll eventually realize it too.

336
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,308
Who the hell are you?!

337
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,895
The guardians of this village.

338
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,107
This is a warning.

339
00:28:12,132 --> 00:28:13,634
Leave this village now!

340
00:28:14,725 --> 00:28:16,060
The hell with them...
Let's kill 'em!

341
00:28:21,224 --> 00:28:22,934
<i>Water Style: Raging Waves!</i>

342
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:31,000
<i>Wind Style: Gale Palm!</i>

343
00:28:35,614 --> 00:28:37,324
Damn! We can't get near them!

344
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,426
Die!

345
00:28:42,978 --> 00:28:44,896
Take one step and I'll skewer you!

346
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,812
We won't let you take
a single step into this village!

347
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,939
Give up now!

348
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,403
<i>Is it because of the rain?!</i>

349
00:28:58,445 --> 00:28:59,446
<i>Now's my chance!</i>

350
00:29:06,943 --> 00:29:08,778
Sorry! Are you okay?

351
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,918
Damn it! There's no end to this!

352
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:16,504
I didn't want to use this, but...

353
00:29:29,215 --> 00:29:31,509
Do you belong to Hanzo's gang?!

354
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:35,148
We're wearing his headband,
but we're not his subordinates.

355
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,192
But some day,

356
00:29:37,606 --> 00:29:41,425
we want to bring peace to
the world just like Hanzo.

357
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:45,158
In other words,
you're just his copycats.

358
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:46,662
We're not copycats!

359
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,537
We will keep peace
in this village!

360
00:29:50,067 --> 00:29:52,236
Not through violence,
but through negotiations!

361
00:29:52,712 --> 00:29:53,922
Are you crazy?

362
00:29:54,387 --> 00:29:56,722
This village lies between
two great nations!

363
00:29:57,427 --> 00:30:01,414
As long as they're at war with
each other, the fighting won't end!

364
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,928
The strong will take everything
from the weak!

365
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,596
That's how the world is!

366
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:10,767
We're fighting to change
that way of thinking!

367
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:14,854
Each one of you must
secretly wish for peace!

368
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:20,001
Listen. One piece of straw is weak...

369
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:23,071
But when you put three together,
it becomes much...

370
00:30:24,271 --> 00:30:26,741
Damn it!
I'm just trying to say,

371
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,910
the more you have,
the stronger it is!

372
00:30:29,675 --> 00:30:30,676
Yahiko...

373
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,377
You're so bad at
making speeches...

374
00:30:33,516 --> 00:30:34,684
Whatever!

375
00:30:34,937 --> 00:30:36,939
Look, we're not going to kill you.

376
00:30:37,825 --> 00:30:39,035
Just get out of here!

377
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,924
I won't guarantee that
we won't attack again!

378
00:30:44,193 --> 00:30:48,031
Fine. We'll do these dozens
of times until you give up...

379
00:30:48,556 --> 00:30:49,682
A hundred times, even.

380
00:30:50,186 --> 00:30:54,566
But just remember,
it'll be more painful the next time!

381
00:30:55,536 --> 00:30:56,746
Retreat!

382
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,079
Earlier, when you tried to attack me,
you protected the kid.

383
00:31:02,637 --> 00:31:03,638
Thank you.

384
00:31:04,504 --> 00:31:06,297
We're war orphans too.

385
00:31:13,732 --> 00:31:15,859
You're such funny kids...

386
00:31:16,414 --> 00:31:20,501
You appear out of nowhere
and ask to protect this village.

387
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:23,464
It's to change this land.

388
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:27,555
War will never leave this land.

389
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:30,096
Nothing will change.

390
00:31:30,865 --> 00:31:31,792
Yahiko...

391
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:36,561
Seems like things are changing,
little by little.

392
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:43,568
We're ninja who left the village

393
00:31:43,593 --> 00:31:47,764
because we didn't think
much of Hanzo's ways.

394
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:52,468
But we were getting sick
of this lifestyle too.

395
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,121
I looked into your eyes

396
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:58,625
and began to feel like
starting over again...

397
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:02,629
But I don't feel like
going back to Hanzo.

398
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,924
So take us in as your lackeys!

399
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:06,966
No!

400
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:08,742
What?! But earlier, you...!

401
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:11,723
Not as lackeys, but as comrades.

402
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:17,936
I'm Yahiko.
This is Nagato and Konan.

403
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,522
I'm Kyusuke the Swift.

404
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:25,693
If you need to gather intel,
you can leave it to these fast legs.

405
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:30,657
Then go and find me other villages
that are suffering like this one.

406
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,619
Yahiko...

407
00:32:34,842 --> 00:32:35,843
What?

408
00:32:36,165 --> 00:32:38,292
You should name our group.

409
00:32:39,976 --> 00:32:43,104
There are more of us now.
It's going to be necessary soon.

410
00:32:45,578 --> 00:32:46,912
A name...

411
00:32:52,056 --> 00:32:54,017
How about... the Akatsuki.

412
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:58,051
This nation weeps from
the sufferings of war.

413
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:02,146
So we will change this nation...

414
00:33:02,171 --> 00:33:05,341
no, this world,
and welcome a new dawn!

415
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,151
Akatsuki...

416
00:33:07,964 --> 00:33:09,090
That's a great name.

417
00:33:09,804 --> 00:33:12,306
Akatsuki! It's decided!

418
00:33:12,852 --> 00:33:13,853
– Yeah!
– Yeah!

419
00:34:16,237 --> 00:34:18,447
Are you the Akatsuki?

420
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,227
Who's that?

421
00:34:23,412 --> 00:34:26,582
The chief of the Hidden Rain,
Hanzo of the Salamander...

422
00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:28,673
Who's the leader?

423
00:34:30,332 --> 00:34:33,252
It's Yahiko!
Yahiko of the Akatsuki!

424
00:34:38,844 --> 00:34:40,471
I shall remember you.

425
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,416
Yahiko?

426
00:34:46,058 --> 00:34:47,142
What does that mean?

427
00:34:48,136 --> 00:34:51,098
Hanzo just acknowledged us.

428
00:34:54,975 --> 00:34:59,021
Our organization is getting larger.
We need to move our hideout.

429
00:34:59,428 --> 00:35:01,305
It's our last day here.

430
00:35:01,781 --> 00:35:02,782
Yes.

431
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,228
This place changed us.

432
00:35:05,925 --> 00:35:06,926
We became strong.

433
00:35:08,102 --> 00:35:10,062
Everything began right here.

434
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:14,403
We are leaving this place in order
to make our dreams come true!

435
00:35:15,048 --> 00:35:16,049
And...

436
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,296
Where did they go?

437
00:35:33,621 --> 00:35:36,124
To think the secret room would come
in handy at the very last moment.

438
00:35:36,774 --> 00:35:38,692
What a way to set out...

439
00:35:39,091 --> 00:35:40,926
But I guess,
it's appropriate for this country.

440
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:44,001
Let's go, Nagato! Konan!

441
00:35:57,196 --> 00:36:00,825
It's like...
the Akatsuki suddenly grew.

442
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,162
They all bought into your dream.

443
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,249
Actually, they're all tired of war.

444
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,378
If everyone unites,
I know we can have peace.

445
00:36:14,322 --> 00:36:15,699
Say, where's Konan?

446
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,134
She went out a while ago.

447
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,635
Why?

448
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,761
I dunno...

449
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,080
This is...

450
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:26,684
Konan's...

451
00:36:29,582 --> 00:36:31,333
"Dear Konan..."

452
00:36:32,448 --> 00:36:34,993
"From the first moment I saw you..."

453
00:36:35,368 --> 00:36:36,369
Is this...?!

454
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:37,612
It's a love letter.

455
00:36:38,665 --> 00:36:41,418
"I've wanted to ask you
how you feel about me."

456
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:46,037
"I'll be waiting anxiously
on the back terrace... Kyusuke."

457
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,624
Don't tell me...
Konan's gone over there?!

458
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:50,691
I dunno...

459
00:36:57,673 --> 00:37:00,359
Yahiko, didn't you have
something to do?

460
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,511
Huh?!

461
00:37:01,536 --> 00:37:04,456
Oh yeah, yeah! I forgot.
I need to go to the john!

462
00:37:05,072 --> 00:37:06,824
I'm going to wet myself!

463
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:16,240
That guy!

464
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:19,862
Running's not the only thing
he's fast at!

465
00:37:20,444 --> 00:37:22,488
More friends also mean...

466
00:37:22,817 --> 00:37:24,949
more competition in love!

467
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,744
No kidding...

468
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:28,663
Hey, Nagato!

469
00:37:29,577 --> 00:37:31,371
Do you like Konan, Yahiko?

470
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,336
Stupid! It's nothing like that!

471
00:37:36,517 --> 00:37:38,727
I think Konan likes you.

472
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,341
Huh?!

473
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,595
Oh, she's coming back.

474
00:37:45,879 --> 00:37:47,213
I know you're there...

475
00:37:47,906 --> 00:37:50,075
Yahiko, Nagato.

476
00:37:51,216 --> 00:37:52,098
Konan...

477
00:37:52,378 --> 00:37:53,546
What did you tell him?

478
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,127
I told him that I don't have time
for a relationship

479
00:37:57,152 --> 00:37:59,571
until we make
the Akatsuki's dream come true.

480
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:01,404
Isn't that right?

481
00:38:02,609 --> 00:38:03,610
Konan...

482
00:38:04,498 --> 00:38:05,499
Yahiko!

483
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,994
Can you help me out with
some training?

484
00:38:10,892 --> 00:38:14,229
That jutsu... doesn't work...
in the rain!

485
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,137
Oiled paper...

486
00:38:26,732 --> 00:38:27,733
Great idea.

487
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,807
I experimented.

488
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,810
If you hesitate,
I'll leave you behind!

489
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,271
Like I'd let you!

490
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,159
Brother, we have a lot of requests.

491
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,161
I don't know if I can fulfill them all.

492
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,329
We'll do them all.

493
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,123
If there are people in need,
we'll save all of them.

494
00:38:54,911 --> 00:38:57,080
That's the purpose of the Akatsuki.

495
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:01,590
At this rate, we might become
an organization as big as Hanzo's.

496
00:39:01,663 --> 00:39:04,958
Hanzo is setting an example
for us shinobi

497
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:08,471
by fighting to bring peace to this world.

498
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:13,184
We will prove that the Akatsuki
can surpass him one day!

499
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,910
Konan, where's Yahiko?

500
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,788
He went to look for food.

501
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,081
Oh...

502
00:39:37,289 --> 00:39:38,290
What's the matter?

503
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:42,963
I'm scared... of my power.

504
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:45,883
Nagato...

505
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,637
Before, I had Jiraiya-sensei.

506
00:39:50,676 --> 00:39:55,889
I'm positive he taught me ninjutsu
so that I could control this power.

507
00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:00,439
But Jiraiya-sensei is no longer here...

508
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:04,068
Yes, Jiraiya-sensei is gone...

509
00:40:05,022 --> 00:40:05,802
But...

510
00:40:06,961 --> 00:40:08,629
You have us.

511
00:40:09,284 --> 00:40:11,737
We'll control your power.

512
00:40:12,245 --> 00:40:13,622
For as long as it takes...

513
00:40:14,294 --> 00:40:15,295
Konan...

514
00:40:33,217 --> 00:40:34,927
Be careful, Yahiko.

515
00:40:35,879 --> 00:40:37,422
You don't need to see me off!

516
00:40:38,226 --> 00:40:40,270
See to Nagato's wound, will you?

517
00:40:41,796 --> 00:40:45,300
From now on,
save your worrying for him.

518
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:48,237
Nagato is the keystone of the Akatsuki!

519
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,382
He's the one who will change
this nation... this world.

520
00:40:52,793 --> 00:40:54,836
The same can be said of you...

521
00:40:55,427 --> 00:40:58,555
Everyone respects and admires you.

522
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:01,454
Nagato is no different.

523
00:41:02,558 --> 00:41:06,729
Nagato is going to be
the bridge to peace.

524
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,512
My role is to be the pillar
that supports that bridge.

525
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,390
Yahiko...

526
00:41:19,383 --> 00:41:22,511
This nation continues to weep.

527
00:41:23,275 --> 00:41:25,110
It continues to endure pain.

528
00:41:26,245 --> 00:41:29,748
I used to hate this land that
cries all the time.

529
00:41:30,665 --> 00:41:32,376
But now, I want to save it.

530
00:41:33,988 --> 00:41:35,698
It's what I want with all my heart.

531
00:41:38,724 --> 00:41:41,935
It reminds me of the crybaby
that I used to be and I can't ignore it.

532
00:41:43,808 --> 00:41:44,809
Yahiko!

533
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,381
Be careful.

534
00:41:50,527 --> 00:41:52,321
He is the bridge to peace...

535
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,763
His will itself is the bridge.

536
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:58,724
Nagato...

537
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:01,571
We believe in Yahiko!

538
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:03,521
Let's go, everyone!

539
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:04,939
Right!

540
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,788
Everyone is growing weary
of fighting.

541
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:22,456
Yes...

542
00:42:23,315 --> 00:42:24,900
Even if we win,

543
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,419
the Akatsuki doesn't receive
any rewards...

544
00:42:28,205 --> 00:42:29,998
The only things we have
are our ideals.

545
00:42:32,172 --> 00:42:36,009
In time, pent-up weariness
will erase that ideal.

546
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:41,517
Are you saying that everyone will
soon forget what they're fighting for?

547
00:42:43,281 --> 00:42:44,324
Nagato...

548
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:47,523
Will you become the leader
of the Akatsuki?

549
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:49,267
Huh?

550
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:52,319
I'm not... cut out to be a leader.

551
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,364
Yahiko...

552
00:42:56,697 --> 00:42:57,990
But you're different.

553
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,287
You have the mark of a hero...

554
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:04,790
A special symbol known
as the Rinnegan...

555
00:43:05,695 --> 00:43:07,822
that will become
everyone's new ideal.

556
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:09,628
Yahiko!

557
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,548
Are you going to take advantage
of my Rinnegan?

558
00:43:15,598 --> 00:43:17,016
I'm scared of myself.

559
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:20,347
I've suffered so long because
of these eyes.

560
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:22,641
I know...

561
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:26,478
But you have someone who can
keep that power in check for you.

562
00:43:27,849 --> 00:43:30,018
Konan will always be at your side.

563
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:32,484
Yahiko...

564
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,698
Hey, Brother! Big news!

565
00:43:37,858 --> 00:43:38,817
What's going on?

566
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:40,534
A messenger from Hanzo is here.

567
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:53,047
Are you Yahiko,
the leader of the Akatsuki?

568
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,590
Yes, I am.

569
00:43:55,382 --> 00:44:00,137
I am Kanzo, a trusted subordinate
of Hanzo the Salamander.

570
00:44:00,908 --> 00:44:04,286
I've heard many rumors
about you Akatsuki...

571
00:44:04,761 --> 00:44:08,140
How you seek peace without
relying on military weapons.

572
00:44:08,899 --> 00:44:11,151
That is the Akatsuki's founding principle.

573
00:44:12,115 --> 00:44:15,535
Hanzo asked me to deliver
a confidential letter to you.

574
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:16,779
Please...

575
00:44:32,967 --> 00:44:34,343
Is he serious?

576
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:38,092
He would like to
meet you personally.

577
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:42,221
Hanzo has given the Akatsuki
his seal of approval.

578
00:44:48,663 --> 00:44:50,164
<i>In time...</i>

579
00:44:50,321 --> 00:44:53,032
<i>Hanzo will leave you to lead
the peace negotiations</i>

580
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:56,226
<i>between the three nations
that surround the Hidden Rain.</i>

581
00:44:56,738 --> 00:44:58,740
<i>Handle the negotiations
between the three nations...?</i>

582
00:44:59,145 --> 00:45:00,689
<i>That's amazing, Brother!</i>

583
00:45:01,962 --> 00:45:04,881
Please relay to Lord Hanzo
that I accept.

584
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:16,130
That means we can help people
out in the open!

585
00:45:17,836 --> 00:45:20,797
So many gave their lives
for us to get to this point.

586
00:45:21,698 --> 00:45:24,368
Finally, we'll be able to
face them with pride.

587
00:45:26,351 --> 00:45:32,106
Yahiko, your determination to free others
from pain reached Hanzo.

588
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,314
Look...

589
00:45:38,393 --> 00:45:40,854
The Akatsuki's ideals
have been restored.

590
00:45:41,144 --> 00:45:43,396
There was never a need
for a symbol.

591
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:49,788
We'll all follow your dream,
no matter where that leads us.

592
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:51,457
Nagato...

593
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,737
We weren't wrong!

594
00:46:04,506 --> 00:46:08,051
Nagato and I will go to
the meeting tomorrow with Lord Hanzo.

595
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,059
Are you sure, Brother?
We'll all go with you...

596
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,561
No, that's not necessary.

597
00:46:12,782 --> 00:46:16,786
Lord Hanzo will be shocked if
too many of us show up.

598
00:46:17,683 --> 00:46:18,928
I know, but...

599
00:46:20,018 --> 00:46:21,269
By the way, where's Konan?

600
00:46:21,882 --> 00:46:24,176
She went to patrol
the Seventh Ward.

601
00:46:24,879 --> 00:46:26,548
She won't be back until
tomorrow morning.

602
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:29,870
I see... On such a special day too.

603
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:33,968
Anyway... Today, the Akatsuki took
a giant step forward!

604
00:46:34,502 --> 00:46:37,588
Everyone! Set aside your duties
for today and celebrate!

605
00:46:58,009 --> 00:46:59,010
<i>Who could have...?</i>

606
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:05,739
<i>This is...!</i>

607
00:47:28,131 --> 00:47:29,591
We finally made it up to this point.

608
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:31,557
Nagato.

609
00:47:33,018 --> 00:47:34,019
You're—!

610
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:37,145
Reality is moving ahead quickly.

611
00:47:38,086 --> 00:47:41,924
Cut your ties with Yahiko immediately
and join me.

612
00:47:42,958 --> 00:47:44,877
Otherwise, you will all...

613
00:47:45,053 --> 00:47:46,263
We will what?

614
00:47:47,512 --> 00:47:50,515
What Yahiko speaks of
are just ideals.

615
00:47:50,979 --> 00:47:52,822
He tries to understand others' pain...

616
00:47:52,847 --> 00:47:55,767
but they do not even attempt
to know our pain.

617
00:47:57,047 --> 00:48:01,301
Furthermore, this world has
no desire for that either.

618
00:48:01,329 --> 00:48:02,872
That is reality.

619
00:48:04,166 --> 00:48:07,753
You possess the Rinnegan,
so you should understand.

620
00:48:09,424 --> 00:48:11,009
No matter what you say,

621
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:13,974
I believe in Yahiko's ideals!

622
00:48:18,293 --> 00:48:22,047
I guess without pain...
you cannot experience reality.

623
00:48:24,168 --> 00:48:27,129
In that respect, even though
you possess the Rinnegan,

624
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,698
you still think like
an average person.

625
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,368
Very well...

626
00:48:33,504 --> 00:48:38,133
Go see reality for yourself,
and experience pain.

627
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,093
There you are, Nagato.

628
00:48:51,031 --> 00:48:52,032
Yahiko...

629
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:53,680
Was someone just here?

630
00:48:53,804 --> 00:48:54,526
No...

631
00:48:55,855 --> 00:48:57,356
Let's get going.

632
00:48:58,038 --> 00:49:00,415
Or we'll be late for the meeting
with Lord Hanzo.

633
00:49:01,173 --> 00:49:02,549
Right, let's go!

634
00:49:16,169 --> 00:49:17,334
Yahiko...

635
00:49:18,412 --> 00:49:21,873
You are the leader,
so you must die.

636
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:25,504
If you resist, this woman will die.

637
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:33,720
You! The red-haired one.

638
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:36,598
Use that to kill Yahiko.

639
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:40,227
Then I will spare you and the woman.

640
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:41,709
Don't, Nagato!

641
00:49:41,734 --> 00:49:42,919
Never mind me!

642
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,856
Both of you escape!

643
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:46,942
Nagato.

644
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,363
Kill me.

645
00:49:55,813 --> 00:49:56,814
Nagato!

646
00:49:57,171 --> 00:49:58,256
No!

647
00:49:58,468 --> 00:49:59,719
Hurry it up.

648
00:49:59,843 --> 00:50:02,136
Or do you want this woman to die?!

649
00:50:32,518 --> 00:50:33,519
Konan...

650
00:50:36,985 --> 00:50:37,477
Yahi—!

651
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:54,968
You and Konan must survive...
no matter what it takes.

652
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:01,266
You are... the savior... of this world.

653
00:51:01,908 --> 00:51:03,201
I know...

654
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:07,272
you can... do it.

655
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:12,750
Yahiko!

656
00:51:15,104 --> 00:51:17,482
<i>I have a huge dream!</i>

657
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,629
Kill them!

658
00:51:34,149 --> 00:51:36,526
<i>If the fighting doesn't stop...</i>

659
00:51:37,502 --> 00:51:40,130
<i>I'll become the god of this world!</i>

660
00:51:44,432 --> 00:51:45,558
He repelled it!

661
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:46,978
How?!

662
00:52:11,394 --> 00:52:12,562
<i>Did we get him?</i>

663
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,475
Nagato...

664
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:28,378
Konan, hold onto Yahiko and stay still.

665
00:52:29,252 --> 00:52:30,670
Not bad, kid!

666
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:34,484
You escaped even while being hit
by my Fire Style Jutsu!

667
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:42,534
You're no ordinary kid.

668
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:43,618
Those eyes...

669
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,079
Get him!

670
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,123
<i>Summoning:</i>

671
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:49,875
<i>Gedo Statue!</i>

672
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:57,924
This is...

673
00:53:08,912 --> 00:53:10,580
What... is that?!

674
00:53:58,026 --> 00:53:59,653
We're dead if that touches us!

675
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:17,921
So you were the leader behind the scenes.

676
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:22,634
It's quite a surprise that
you possess the Rinnegan.

677
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:28,473
Nagato...

678
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,478
<i>Body Flicker Jutsu!</i>

679
00:55:07,482 --> 00:55:09,484
<i>Yahiko died...</i>

680
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:14,060
<i>And from then on, I took over
as the leader of our organization.</i>

681
00:55:23,161 --> 00:55:25,329
Didn't I say so?

682
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:27,949
Yeah, I finally understand.

683
00:55:28,323 --> 00:55:32,536
The selfish desire to
preserve peace causes war.

684
00:55:32,561 --> 00:55:35,314
Hatred is born from wanting
to protect love.

685
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:40,128
There's no such thing as peace
in this accursed world.

686
00:55:41,133 --> 00:55:42,801
Exactly.

687
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:01,524
You will always be the leader
of the Akatsuki...

688
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:04,778
Yahiko.

689
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:18,625
Who could bring me to this point?

690
00:56:20,914 --> 00:56:23,375
Have you forgotten my face?

691
00:56:23,499 --> 00:56:24,623
You are...

692
00:56:24,648 --> 00:56:26,024
Yahiko of Akatsuki!

693
00:56:26,342 --> 00:56:27,885
You are supposed to be dead.

694
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:29,344
What's going on?!

695
00:56:29,478 --> 00:56:32,606
You teamed up with Danzo
and betrayed us.

696
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:35,859
You now only think
of self-preservation.

697
00:56:35,884 --> 00:56:37,011
You're trash.

698
00:56:38,434 --> 00:56:40,520
I once respected you.

699
00:56:41,761 --> 00:56:43,909
But, you have changed.

700
00:56:43,934 --> 00:56:45,519
Just who are you?!

701
00:56:45,816 --> 00:56:47,943
How can you be so strong?!

702
00:56:48,787 --> 00:56:54,626
And you don't even understand
why you will lose.

703
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:57,122
Vanish, Hanzo!

704
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:58,748
S-Stop...

705
00:57:05,573 --> 00:57:10,453
Since that day, countless comrades
fought and died.

706
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:14,013
One by one...
One after another...

707
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:16,975
They continued to die.

708
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:22,856
The peace-addled citizens
of the Land of Fire...

709
00:57:23,235 --> 00:57:28,513
The meager payments they make to
the Hidden Leaf become war funds.

710
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:34,325
The Land of Fire is fully aware
of having taken part in war,

711
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:36,911
yet they falsely proclaim peace.

712
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:43,001
The peace you great nations enjoy
only exists precariously

713
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:45,837
atop the sacrifices of
us small nations.

714
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:50,592
To us, your peace means violence.

715
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:58,475
Just by living, people hurt others
without even realizing it.

716
00:57:58,856 --> 00:58:03,777
So long as humanity exists,
hate will also exist.

717
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:09,360
True peace cannot exist in
this cursed world.

718
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:16,034
Everything Jiraiya-sensei said
is wishful thinking!

719
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:24,834
I have told you my story.

720
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:27,962
Now let me hear your answer.

721
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:45,313
<i>But I have faith that
there will come a time</i>

722
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,607
<i>when people can truly understand
one another.</i>

723
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:53,971
You may be right.

724
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:57,742
I also think the same way.

725
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:00,370
I see...

726
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:03,623
I get where you're coming
from now.

727
00:59:05,665 --> 00:59:11,587
But I still...
can't forgive you.

728
00:59:13,671 --> 00:59:15,089
I still hate you.

729
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:17,971
Then you want to settle this?

730
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:20,515
But...

731
00:59:22,062 --> 00:59:25,858
Pervy Sage believed in me,
and entrusted his dream to me.

732
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:32,151
So I'm going to believe...
in what Pervy Sage believed in!

733
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,780
That's my answer.

734
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:41,202
So... I won't kill you guys.

735
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:48,501
You'll believe in what
Jiraiya-sensei believed?

736
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:51,337
I see.

737
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:53,840
So that's your answer?

738
00:59:55,356 --> 00:59:58,319
And do you expect us to wait...

739
00:59:58,344 --> 01:00:02,223
until you make this world
a peaceful place?

740
01:00:04,225 --> 01:00:05,518
Don't play with me!

741
01:00:05,702 --> 01:00:08,997
It's far too late for me to
believe Jiraiya's words!

742
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:11,774
There's no such thing as true peace!

743
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:14,819
As long as we live in
this cursed world

744
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:17,905
peace is impossible!

745
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:21,743
Then...

746
01:00:22,029 --> 01:00:25,199
Then... I'll break that curse.

747
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:29,542
If there is such a thing as peace,
I'll seize it!

748
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:32,420
I'll never give up!

749
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:37,300
You...

750
01:00:38,641 --> 01:00:41,853
Those... words...

751
01:00:42,604 --> 01:00:44,147
That's right.

752
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:48,227
They're taken straight from this book.

753
01:00:49,238 --> 01:00:52,366
The first novel written
by Pervy Sage.

754
01:00:54,245 --> 01:00:58,624
Pervy Sage was seriously trying
to change the world with this.

755
01:01:01,014 --> 01:01:04,685
At the end of this book,
he wrote about a student

756
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:06,336
who inspired him...

757
01:01:07,181 --> 01:01:09,559
It was you, Nagato.

758
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:14,520
No...

759
01:01:33,528 --> 01:01:34,612
Sensei...

760
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,776
What's the matter?

761
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:38,695
Is this a good time?

762
01:01:39,483 --> 01:01:42,820
Sure... I was trying to
start on my book,

763
01:01:42,845 --> 01:01:45,514
but I can't come up with any ideas.

764
01:01:48,730 --> 01:01:51,733
I figured I'd take a break
and get a bite to eat.

765
01:01:59,864 --> 01:02:01,157
So? What's going on?

766
01:02:02,435 --> 01:02:06,689
About what you once said to me
about the hatred in this world...

767
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:08,933
I've been thinking about it.

768
01:02:09,743 --> 01:02:13,371
Oh yeah? Have you figured
anything out?

769
01:02:14,485 --> 01:02:15,570
Peace...

770
01:02:16,677 --> 01:02:20,138
I don't know how to
achieve peace yet.

771
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:22,979
But...

772
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:27,285
Some day, I'll break this curse.

773
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:31,873
If there is such a thing as peace,
I'll seize it!

774
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:36,716
There's something more important
than the method.

775
01:02:37,451 --> 01:02:39,745
It's the power to believe in it!

776
01:02:40,883 --> 01:02:44,095
I see... That's an excellent thought.

777
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,596
You may very well be correct.

778
01:02:51,642 --> 01:02:53,186
What is it?

779
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:57,315
Thanks to you, I think I'll be able
to write a fine novel!

780
01:02:58,357 --> 01:02:59,882
Now then...

781
01:02:59,907 --> 01:03:04,137
First, I've got to come up with
a name for the hero.

782
01:03:10,089 --> 01:03:11,423
Nagato...

783
01:03:11,783 --> 01:03:16,413
You three have grown up.
Don't you agree?

784
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:24,675
Thank you, Sensei.

785
01:03:32,415 --> 01:03:34,709
Come on, stop crying Yahiko.

786
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:36,813
I'm sure we'll see him again someday.

787
01:03:38,541 --> 01:03:39,750
Sensei...

788
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:58,626
Why don't you give it up?

789
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:00,962
This game of tag is getting boring.

790
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:13,474
<i>A smoke bomb?</i>

791
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:24,944
Give it up.

792
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:26,988
Can I say one thing?

793
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,165
I don't care to listen!

794
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:31,784
Die already!

795
01:04:32,318 --> 01:04:34,153
Give up...

796
01:04:36,497 --> 01:04:37,707
on me giving up!

797
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:44,088
Even if you bring me down,

798
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:47,383
another assassin will attack
the village.

799
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:55,182
As long as we are cursed to
live in the ninja world,

800
01:04:55,284 --> 01:04:57,203
there will be no peace.

801
01:04:59,103 --> 01:05:00,104
Then...

802
01:05:00,354 --> 01:05:02,523
I'll break that curse!

803
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:07,862
If there is such a thing as peace,
I'll seize it!

804
01:05:08,362 --> 01:05:10,156
I'll never give up!

805
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:14,702
Wh-Who are you?

806
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:17,330
My name is...

807
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:18,748
Naruto!

808
01:05:21,512 --> 01:05:26,726
My name is a precious gift
from Pervy Sage!

809
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:31,093
I cannot just give up and stain
my master's keepsake!

810
01:05:34,094 --> 01:05:35,804
I will be the Hokage!

811
01:05:35,853 --> 01:05:39,065
And I will bring peace to
the Hidden Rain!

812
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:41,062
Please believe in me!

813
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,485
How?

814
01:05:48,694 --> 01:05:52,198
How can you say that
you will never change?

815
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:58,871
That you will not change no
matter how great the pain you face.

816
01:05:59,771 --> 01:06:02,441
Can you continue believing
in yourself?

817
01:06:03,264 --> 01:06:04,933
Can you guarantee it?

818
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,590
Can you have such faith
in yourself?

819
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:14,845
I've experienced pain too...

820
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:38,470
And there's a lot of pain nesting
inside of me as well.

821
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:45,186
There's no telling what kind of pain
will come after me.

822
01:07:45,566 --> 01:07:49,295
If I stop believing because of that...

823
01:07:50,379 --> 01:07:52,324
If the hero should change

824
01:07:53,011 --> 01:07:54,808
it'll turn into another story.

825
01:07:56,302 --> 01:07:59,931
It'll turn into a different story from
the one my master left behind.

826
01:08:01,226 --> 01:08:03,228
Then it won't be Naruto!

827
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:09,376
I can't write novels like my master did.

828
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:15,466
That's why... the sequel has to come
from the life I live.

829
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:19,595
No matter how great the pain,
I'll continue walking.

830
01:08:20,656 --> 01:08:22,366
Because that's who Naruto is!

831
01:08:24,016 --> 01:08:28,270
If the hero changes,
it'll turn into a different story.

832
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,777
You and I are sibling disciples.

833
01:08:35,352 --> 01:08:38,964
As students of the same master, we
ought to be able to understand one another.

834
01:08:38,989 --> 01:08:40,407
That is what I said to you earlier.

835
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:45,287
I meant it as a joke.

836
01:08:49,406 --> 01:08:51,533
You are a curious fellow.

837
01:08:52,419 --> 01:08:54,797
You remind me of how I once was.

838
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:56,924
Nagato...

839
01:08:57,466 --> 01:09:00,636
I wasn't able to believe in Jiraiya.

840
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:04,974
Nor... could I believe in myself.

841
01:09:07,262 --> 01:09:08,263
However...

842
01:09:09,436 --> 01:09:14,108
I have a feeling that, unlike me,
you will walk towards a different future.

843
01:09:21,735 --> 01:09:27,077
I think I shall believe in you...
Naruto Uzumaki.

844
01:09:29,947 --> 01:09:32,866
<i>Gedo Art of Rinne Rebirth.</i>

845
01:09:33,762 --> 01:09:35,264
Nagato don't!

846
01:09:35,701 --> 01:09:38,037
Konan... It's okay.

847
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:41,927
I am making a new decision.

848
01:09:42,761 --> 01:09:45,347
A decision I had once given up on.

849
01:09:45,472 --> 01:09:48,475
What is it?
What kind of jutsu is that?

850
01:09:51,645 --> 01:09:53,823
Those who possess the Rinnegan
are able to use

851
01:09:53,848 --> 01:09:56,175
the jutsu of all six Pains,

852
01:09:56,736 --> 01:10:00,490
and are said to exist outside
the realm of life and death.

853
01:10:02,412 --> 01:10:06,500
Nagato's ocular power is the jutsu
that controls life and death.

854
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:08,996
He is the seventh Pain.

855
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:15,377
<i>Gedo...</i>

856
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:19,111
<i>If he performs the jutsu at
his current chakra level...</i>

857
01:10:19,136 --> 01:10:20,804
<i>Nagato will not survive.</i>

858
01:10:22,347 --> 01:10:24,432
<i>He is willing to go that far
for this child...</i>

859
01:10:26,913 --> 01:10:30,500
<i>This mysterious child has
changed Nagato.</i>

860
01:11:08,122 --> 01:11:12,376
Who would have thought that
both you and I would die so young?

861
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:18,065
Although not as early as your mother.

862
01:11:21,026 --> 01:11:24,530
Father, I've always wanted
to ask you something.

863
01:11:28,370 --> 01:11:32,374
Why did someone like you, who was
known as the White Fang of the Leaf

864
01:11:32,579 --> 01:11:35,040
choose to ignore the village code

865
01:11:35,082 --> 01:11:39,670
and abandon a crucial mission
in order to save his comrades?

866
01:11:42,006 --> 01:11:44,133
If you had not done so,

867
01:11:44,158 --> 01:11:50,415
no one would have condemned you and
you wouldn't have become so miserable.

868
01:11:53,126 --> 01:11:54,586
I felt so bitter.

869
01:11:58,345 --> 01:12:03,016
I see...
You took it pretty hard, didn't you?

870
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:05,070
Yeah.

871
01:12:08,198 --> 01:12:10,117
But you know, Father...

872
01:12:10,225 --> 01:12:13,978
Whatever the outcome,
I know you did your best.

873
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:18,000
I can see that now
and I understand you.

874
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:24,798
You broke the code to save everyone.
And I'm proud of you for it.

875
01:12:36,332 --> 01:12:37,709
Thank you.

876
01:12:54,119 --> 01:12:55,329
What is that?!

877
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:10,052
What is that light?!

878
01:13:18,633 --> 01:13:21,761
Ma? Where am I?

879
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:26,860
- Whoa!
- What's going on, Guy-sensei?

880
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:30,572
I see!

881
01:13:30,953 --> 01:13:33,873
<i>Lord Fukasaku was definitely dead!</i>

882
01:13:34,312 --> 01:13:38,197
<i>And yet...
What just happened?!</i>

883
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:47,297
I-Impossible!
How can such a thing occur?!

884
01:13:57,474 --> 01:13:59,435
What's going on?

885
01:14:02,699 --> 01:14:03,950
Iruka-sensei!

886
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:08,235
- You're alive!
- You too, Sensei!

887
01:14:08,402 --> 01:14:10,261
Ebisu-sensei, are you hurt?

888
01:14:10,756 --> 01:14:12,717
This is nothing.

889
01:14:12,906 --> 01:14:15,242
Konohamaru saved me.

890
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:21,415
But never mind my injury.
What is this phenomenon?

891
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:22,597
Yes...

892
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:29,590
What? What just happened?!

893
01:14:29,925 --> 01:14:33,262
The villagers are coming back to life,
one after another.

894
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:35,512
What?! You mean...

895
01:14:39,348 --> 01:14:43,136
<i>I'll stay here and
look after them for a while.</i>

896
01:14:43,161 --> 01:14:46,582
<i>Just until they can take
better care of themselves.</i>

897
01:14:46,971 --> 01:14:49,808
<i>It's the least I can do.</i>

898
01:14:52,782 --> 01:14:57,578
I'm still in time to revive those I've
killed since arriving in the Leaf Village.

899
01:14:58,245 --> 01:15:02,168
It's the least
I can do for them.

900
01:15:03,727 --> 01:15:04,798
What's this?

901
01:15:05,292 --> 01:15:09,505
Seems it was too soon for you
to come here.

902
01:15:10,333 --> 01:15:13,170
There must be something
you're still meant to do.

903
01:15:15,385 --> 01:15:16,612
Father...

904
01:15:17,055 --> 01:15:18,932
I'm glad we got to talk.

905
01:15:20,246 --> 01:15:24,000
Thank you for forgiving me.

906
01:15:26,587 --> 01:15:29,548
Now I can move on in peace.

907
01:15:44,155 --> 01:15:47,325
I'll finally be able to see your mother.

908
01:15:49,047 --> 01:15:51,425
- Pa!
- Yes.

909
01:15:53,429 --> 01:15:55,347
Kakashi too, eh?

910
01:15:56,343 --> 01:15:57,848
What's going on?

911
01:15:57,873 --> 01:16:01,960
Thank goodness!
I'm so glad, Kakashi-sensei!

912
01:16:02,266 --> 01:16:04,393
I will explain everything.

913
01:16:13,944 --> 01:16:15,161
You...

914
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:22,286
War inflicts death, injury,
and pain to both sides.

915
01:16:23,234 --> 01:16:26,613
The death of someone dear
is hard to accept.

916
01:16:27,052 --> 01:16:31,473
We convince ourselves
there's no way they could die.

917
01:16:34,543 --> 01:16:38,164
It especially can't be helped
with your generation.

918
01:16:38,248 --> 01:16:40,248
You don't know war.

919
01:16:40,967 --> 01:16:46,890
You may try to find meaning in death,
but there is only pain.

920
01:16:46,967 --> 01:16:50,721
An unbearable hatred...

921
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,570
Senseless deaths...

922
01:16:53,595 --> 01:16:57,515
Eternal hatred...
And pain that does not heal.

923
01:16:58,538 --> 01:17:00,998
That's what war is.

924
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:08,210
Naruto... This is what you
will be facing in time.

925
01:17:11,957 --> 01:17:14,793
Regarding that book, and you...

926
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:19,009
It feels like someone set it up.

927
01:17:19,217 --> 01:17:24,848
Or... Perhaps this is
the real work of a god.

928
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:32,403
It seems my work ends here, Naruto.

929
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:37,402
I believe you can bring true peace.

930
01:18:00,924 --> 01:18:03,426
You're taking this one with you too?

931
01:18:04,429 --> 01:18:10,018
Yes... Tendo Pain was created
from Yahiko's body.

932
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:13,063
He is very precious to us.

933
01:18:13,313 --> 01:18:16,191
So he was... Yahiko.

934
01:18:22,823 --> 01:18:24,574
So what are you going to do?

935
01:18:24,741 --> 01:18:28,036
I hate to think that
you're returning to the Akatsuki.

936
01:18:28,977 --> 01:18:30,854
I'm leaving the Akatsuki.

937
01:18:31,063 --> 01:18:34,983
Yahiko and Nagato meant
everything to me.

938
01:18:36,294 --> 01:18:37,963
Yahiko's dream...

939
01:18:38,692 --> 01:18:40,944
And Nagato's dream...

940
01:18:41,553 --> 01:18:44,431
If both of their dreams have been
passed on to you,

941
01:18:44,526 --> 01:18:46,785
then you now embody their dreams.

942
01:18:48,056 --> 01:18:53,228
Nagato put his faith in you.
So will I.

943
01:18:54,237 --> 01:18:59,794
We, the Hidden Rain,
will pursue their dreams with you.

944
01:19:08,535 --> 01:19:14,331
The name Naruto, the guts
to never give up, and pain.

945
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:20,505
That's what I inherited from my teacher
and sibling disciple!

946
01:19:38,989 --> 01:19:40,625
This time...

947
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:44,529
I pray that you will be the blossom of hope
that never wilts.

948
01:19:51,105 --> 01:19:53,650
<i>Just you watch, Master!</i>

949
01:20:46,466 --> 01:20:47,926
Good job.

950
01:20:49,052 --> 01:20:50,720
Kakashi-sensei...

951
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:52,973
Just lean on me.

952
01:21:12,617 --> 01:21:14,536
<i>He's gotten heavy.</i>

953
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:18,322
Hmm?

954
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:23,879
Welcome back!

955
01:21:23,962 --> 01:21:25,714
We knew you could do it!

956
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:39,436
They've all been awaiting your return.

957
01:21:43,316 --> 01:21:45,944
<i>My dream is to surpass the Hokage!</i>

958
01:21:46,192 --> 01:21:51,031
<i>And make everyone in
the village acknowledge me!</i>

959
01:21:56,479 --> 01:22:00,191
Naruto... You did well.

960
01:22:01,864 --> 01:22:03,115
Welcome back!

961
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:04,307
Naruto!

962
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:06,583
Wh-What's going on?

963
01:22:06,963 --> 01:22:11,468
I relayed every detail of
the events that occurred.

964
01:22:11,603 --> 01:22:14,022
Hey! What was the enemy like?

965
01:22:14,304 --> 01:22:15,764
Are you hurt?

966
01:22:15,805 --> 01:22:18,308
Oww! Don't push!

967
01:22:19,476 --> 01:22:21,770
<i>I'm so glad, Naruto.</i>

968
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:33,531
Hey! Cut it out!

969
01:22:34,358 --> 01:22:35,526
Sakura...

970
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:39,287
You're so reckless, you idiot!

971
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:56,304
Thank you.

972
01:22:59,683 --> 01:23:01,851
Way to go, Naruto.

973
01:23:01,935 --> 01:23:04,896
Yes! That's what youth is!

974
01:23:06,022 --> 01:23:08,692
I can't believe
he pulled it off all by himself.

975
01:23:08,717 --> 01:23:10,302
Uh-huh...

976
01:23:10,402 --> 01:23:12,195
I could almost fall for him.

977
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:13,355
- Huh?!
- Huh?!

978
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:15,799
Ain't he something, that Naruto?

979
01:23:15,967 --> 01:23:17,886
That's my classmate!

980
01:23:18,034 --> 01:23:20,620
He really outclassed us.

981
01:23:20,645 --> 01:23:23,773
Shut up.
We'll make it up starting now!

982
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:29,212
Let's join them, Iruka-sensei!

983
01:23:29,994 --> 01:23:31,996
No, I'm fine right here.

984
01:23:32,103 --> 01:23:34,397
- But...
- Now, now...

985
01:23:35,303 --> 01:23:37,972
Naruto is amazing, isn't he?

986
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:46,771
At first, everyone thought he was
such a nuisance, including myself.

987
01:23:47,865 --> 01:23:51,744
We feared his destiny,
so we kept him at arm's length

988
01:23:51,899 --> 01:23:53,991
and didn't bother with him.

989
01:23:55,327 --> 01:23:58,121
<i>That fox kid shouldn't
become a ninja!</i>

990
01:23:58,430 --> 01:24:00,766
<i>What is the Third Hokage thinking?!</i>

991
01:24:01,287 --> 01:24:02,723
<i>That Team Kakashi...</i>

992
01:24:02,748 --> 01:24:05,042
<i>I heard they defeated
the terrorist Zabuza!</i>

993
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:08,126
<i>Sounds like the Nine-Tails kid
had a part in it...</i>

994
01:24:08,126 --> 01:24:11,254
<i>No way...
I heard he was a loser.</i>

995
01:24:11,328 --> 01:24:13,455
<i>I bet it was Kakashi's doing.</i>

996
01:24:13,673 --> 01:24:17,944
<i>I hear that Nine-Tails kid made it
to the Finals of the Chunin Exam.</i>

997
01:24:18,310 --> 01:24:21,723
<i>Are you serious?!
He's more skilled than I thought.</i>

998
01:24:21,931 --> 01:24:25,477
<i>Humph! I just hope the fox demon
doesn't go on a rampage.</i>

999
01:24:41,593 --> 01:24:43,220
<i>Oh!</i>

1000
01:24:43,693 --> 01:24:45,236
<i>That fox kid?</i>

1001
01:24:45,413 --> 01:24:47,290
<i>I can't believe he won against a Hyuga.</i>

1002
01:24:47,315 --> 01:24:49,859
<i>That was an awesome match!</i>

1003
01:24:50,126 --> 01:24:54,214
<i>I never expected such
a battle from the fox kid.</i>

1004
01:24:54,576 --> 01:24:56,318
<i>He's quite a boy.</i>

1005
01:25:02,222 --> 01:25:06,726
However, he never ever gave up.

1006
01:25:06,751 --> 01:25:09,191
And he stayed true to his Ninja Way.

1007
01:25:09,216 --> 01:25:13,136
And slowly, but surely
we couldn't help but acknowledge him.

1008
01:25:22,367 --> 01:25:23,692
<i>D-Da...</i>

1009
01:25:26,462 --> 01:25:28,431
<i>Damn it!</i>

1010
01:25:40,266 --> 01:25:43,728
<i>I heard he protected the village from
the Sand Jinchuriki!</i>

1011
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:45,098
<i>Who did?</i>

1012
01:25:45,306 --> 01:25:49,352
<i>Naruto Uzumaki.
You know, the one...</i>

1013
01:25:59,612 --> 01:26:02,073
<i>I'm so glad the Fifth Hokage
has been decided!</i>

1014
01:26:02,115 --> 01:26:03,908
<i>We can breathe a little easier now.</i>

1015
01:26:04,117 --> 01:26:06,911
<i>Thanks to Lord Jiraiya and Naruto!</i>

1016
01:26:06,953 --> 01:26:09,372
<i>Is it true they fought Orochimaru?</i>

1017
01:26:42,071 --> 01:26:45,533
<i>I heard they couldn't bring
Sasuke Uchiha back.</i>

1018
01:26:45,773 --> 01:26:49,401
<i>I hope Naruto isn't too depressed.</i>

1019
01:26:50,863 --> 01:26:55,284
<i>A group named the Akatsuki
is after the Jinchuriki.</i>

1020
01:26:55,793 --> 01:26:58,845
<i>Which means Naruto will
also be targeted.</i>

1021
01:26:59,172 --> 01:27:00,673
<i>Will he be okay?</i>

1022
01:27:00,715 --> 01:27:03,468
<i>Lord Jiraiya will look out
for Naruto.</i>

1023
01:27:05,511 --> 01:27:09,515
<i>I heard that Naruto rescued
the Sand's Kazekage from the Akatsuki!</i>

1024
01:27:10,808 --> 01:27:14,479
<i>Wouldn't it be great if this results
in an alliance between the Leaf and Sand?</i>

1025
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:27,867
<i>The Akatsuki has killed Lord Jiraiya!</i>

1026
01:27:28,189 --> 01:27:29,815
<i>Is Naruto all right?!</i>

1027
01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:35,683
<i>Naruto has
Lord Jiraiya's determination!</i>

1028
01:27:35,708 --> 01:27:37,335
<i>He hasn't lost heart!</i>

1029
01:27:37,502 --> 01:27:40,171
<i>He'll keep on going, like always!</i>

1030
01:27:41,297 --> 01:27:45,060
Today, everyone trusts Naruto implicitly.

1031
01:27:45,085 --> 01:27:48,046
They worry about him, have high hopes
for him and pray for him.

1032
01:27:48,351 --> 01:27:52,981
He truly changed the hearts
of many people.

1033
01:27:53,935 --> 01:27:57,563
It's because he did his best.

1034
01:28:02,318 --> 01:28:03,665
<i>Iruka...</i>

1035
01:28:03,690 --> 01:28:05,609
<i>Yes, Lord Hokage?</i>

1036
01:28:05,905 --> 01:28:09,492
<i>I agree with you to a point,</i>

1037
01:28:09,534 --> 01:28:11,911
<i>but he is just like you.</i>

1038
01:28:12,078 --> 01:28:14,163
<i>He never knew parental love</i>

1039
01:28:14,205 --> 01:28:17,694
<i>and because of that incident,
people avoided him.</i>

1040
01:28:18,209 --> 01:28:24,090
<i>So in order to get attention,
he resorted to mischief.</i>

1041
01:28:24,524 --> 01:28:26,268
<i>In whatever shape or form,</i>

1042
01:28:26,293 --> 01:28:29,921
<i>he desperately wanted to validate
his existence and his worth.</i>

1043
01:28:37,770 --> 01:28:44,110
<i>The Fourth Hokage wanted the villagers
to regard Naruto as a hero.</i>

1044
01:28:44,485 --> 01:28:48,197
<i>He placed the seal and
died hoping for that.</i>

1045
01:29:11,471 --> 01:29:15,183
<i>Third Hokage... Fourth Hokage...</i>

1046
01:29:19,779 --> 01:29:23,908
<i>There is a hero right before our eyes.</i>

1047
01:31:24,854 --> 01:31:26,105
Where's Suigetsu?

1048
01:31:27,106 --> 01:31:28,691
Suigetsu? Who knows?

1049
01:31:29,164 --> 01:31:32,083
He went out two or three days ago
and hasn't come back.

1050
01:31:32,654 --> 01:31:35,198
I don't mind if he never comes back.

1051
01:31:35,854 --> 01:31:37,481
I can hear you!

1052
01:31:39,368 --> 01:31:43,164
The Executioner's Blade...
You still have that?

1053
01:31:44,227 --> 01:31:47,189
You left it behind! It was a pain
to go back and retrieve it.

1054
01:31:48,532 --> 01:31:52,703
Why should I carry your things
while fighting the Eight-Tails?!

1055
01:31:52,957 --> 01:31:55,960
I carried the two of you out of there
when you were dying.

1056
01:31:56,501 --> 01:31:57,544
So quit fighting.

1057
01:31:57,915 --> 01:31:59,541
Don't act so high and mighty!

1058
01:32:00,878 --> 01:32:04,048
Fine. Whatever the case, I got it back.

1059
01:32:04,439 --> 01:32:08,735
I don't feel right without this.

1060
01:32:09,373 --> 01:32:13,127
We're all here.
We're moving out. Get ready.

1061
01:32:13,419 --> 01:32:15,463
Huh? Are your wounds all right?

1062
01:32:16,517 --> 01:32:17,518
Yeah.

1063
01:32:18,626 --> 01:32:20,294
We're going to the Leaf Village.
