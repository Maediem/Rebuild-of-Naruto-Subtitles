1
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,715
Oh, Senpai!

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,300
Over there...
There's a dango shop!

3
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:12,387
Let's take a break.

4
00:00:12,623 --> 00:00:16,204
We've been walking all day.
I'm exhausted!

5
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,602
You don't look exhausted at all.

6
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,565
How can you be so carefree?

7
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:28,862
But Senpai, we're trying to
catch a Tailed Beast,

8
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:31,281
yet we don't even know where it is.

9
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,450
So there's no need to rush.

10
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,997
By the way,
what are we going to catch again?

11
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:38,873
Three-Tails! Three-Tails!

12
00:00:39,068 --> 00:00:40,862
One-Tail, Two-Tails...

13
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,210
And I'm Tobi! Just kidding!

14
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,437
Here's dango for you.

15
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:54,513
Wow! It looks yummy!
Let's see...

16
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,849
Munch time!

17
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:08,117
Man, it's so good!
This sauce is excellent.

18
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:13,199
It's not too sweet, nor too salty.
It's a masterpiece!

19
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,409
Ahh... It was great.

20
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:19,788
Oh! Senpai, Senpai, look at that!

21
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:22,249
Huh?

22
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:26,377
That looks exactly like
your work, doesn't it?

23
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:33,426
Could it be that your art is...
a rip-off?

24
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:36,931
You...!

25
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,520
I'm going to kill you!

26
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,386
Th-This is...

27
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,972
The Three-Tails is about to appear!

28
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:53,483
What's this feeling...?

29
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,652
What's the matter, Shino?

30
00:03:56,527 --> 00:04:00,114
My insects... feel a weird chakra.

31
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,325
Weird chakra?

32
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:06,746
They've never felt so much chakra before.

33
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:12,377
It looks like Akamaru feels
the same thing as your insects!

34
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,005
Then it must be there!

35
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,547
Let's hurry up.

36
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:25,056
This feeling... The air is charged,
and there's a sense of panic...

37
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,768
This isn't from the guys
from the Hidden Leaf.

38
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,652
What's happening?

39
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:42,490
Right there?!

40
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:45,994
What the hell is that?
A fog...?

41
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,543
It looks like the bats are flying
toward the fog.

42
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:54,752
No question about it!

43
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,505
A huge amount of chakra
is coming from over there.

44
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:00,591
Is it inside that fog?

45
00:05:00,844 --> 00:05:03,472
Yes, but we can't identify it.

46
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:06,474
Let's dive in and find out!

47
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,474
Hey, slow down.

48
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,019
Let's get ready first.

49
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,229
Heh! That's what I wanted to hear!

50
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,275
Everyone, prepare for action!
But don't rush!

51
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,318
- Roger!
- Roger!

52
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,820
Understood!

53
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,378
They're increasing in number.

54
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,673
Did they call for reinforcements?

55
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,511
I think they can easily see us!

56
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,555
It doesn't matter!
Let's drop in!

57
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,850
We're outnumbered.

58
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:53,396
Let's buy some time until
Guren gets here!

59
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,564
Kihou, lay a smoke screen!

60
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,441
Understood.

61
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,495
Kakashi-senpai!

62
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,873
A smoke screen...
They're lying in wait for us.

63
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,417
But if we stay here too long,

64
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,963
we won't be able to find out
what's happening at the lake.

65
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,423
We should split into two groups...

66
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,594
Naruto, you go by yourself.

67
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,678
What?! I'm not attacking?

68
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,139
Our primary mission is to investigate the lake.

69
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,016
Oh, that's right...

70
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:36,270
We'll create a diversion and
you head off to the center of the lake.

71
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,231
But don't attack.

72
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,816
Yes, understood.

73
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,444
Are you sure? Only Naruto...?

74
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,697
Let's show him a bit of trust.

75
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:51,285
No one is a better survivor than Naruto.

76
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,538
Good luck, Naruto.

77
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:56,874
You're the Hidden Leaf's number one...

78
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,584
unpredictable ninja.

79
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:07,260
No reaction...
It looks like nobody's here.

80
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:08,843
Let's go!

81
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:17,563
Damn it! I can't see anything.

82
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,523
Did they escape already?

83
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,567
They must be buying time.

84
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,485
Keep your guard up!

85
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,447
All right, I think from here...

86
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,450
I'm going to head into the lake!

87
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,088
I went in too deep...

88
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,340
Snack for me.

89
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:49,261
Hey, right after we got home,
you called us over here!

90
00:07:49,348 --> 00:07:51,725
You're working us toads too hard!

91
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:56,059
Come on, I'll give you something in return.

92
00:07:56,226 --> 00:08:02,107
But, this intense chakra...
I wonder what's behind the fog?

93
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:19,249
It's coming!

94
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:40,396
This is the Three-Tails...

95
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:43,441
It's more than we expected...

96
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:47,569
What is this...?!
This intimidating presence...!

97
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,156
We did it... It was a success.

98
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,992
Yuukimaru is controlling the Three-Tails!

99
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,581
Yuukimaru!

100
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:03,335
Damn! If he keeps using his power...!

101
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:06,505
If he fails,
what will happen to the Three-Tails?

102
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,383
Your job is to stop that from happening!

103
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:16,766
<i>Even Yuukimaru's power can't control
the Three-Tails...!</i>

104
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,519
Yuukimaru!

105
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:41,249
What's that sound?!

106
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,779
Guren!
Stop this beast immediately!

107
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,364
Stop being so bossy!

108
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,332
<i>This beast!
Although he's huge, he's quick!</i>

109
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,803
Right now!

110
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:29,213
Gozu!

111
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:30,548
Hurry!

112
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:37,304
<i>Crystal Style: Divine Pathway jutsu!</i>

113
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,268
There!

114
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,278
My crystal shattered?!

115
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:59,200
<i>Giant Crystal Hexagonal Shuriken!</i>

116
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,625
This is so hard!

117
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,210
You filthy turtle!

118
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,005
Guren! What are you doing?

119
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:16,260
Are you trying to kill the Three-Tails?!
Contain him! Or we'll all die!

120
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:20,431
<i>Large-scale jutsu need preparation!</i>

121
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,233
<i>It's too late!</i>

122
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:39,283
Gozu...!

123
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,709
Hurry...

124
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:51,128
<i>Crystal Style:
Crystal Wall, 8th Formation!</i>

125
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,422
Eat this, turtle bastard!

126
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:01,638
<i>She did it...!</i>

127
00:12:03,585 --> 00:12:04,586
<i>Crystal Style...</i>

128
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,853
<i>I never knew Guren
had this much ability...</i>

129
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:20,324
I used a bit too much... chakra...

130
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,500
Hey Shino,
don't get too close to me!

131
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,960
I wouldn't get too close to you.

132
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,879
Then why did your shoulder brush
against me?!

133
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:39,426
Because we're closing ranks.

134
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:43,972
Keep your mouth shut!
Focus on finding the enemy.

135
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,265
But, Kakashi-sensei!

136
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,850
Above us! Watch out!

137
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,106
<i>Our ambush failed!</i>

138
00:12:58,569 --> 00:12:59,570
Kakashi-sensei!

139
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:02,450
Thanks, Sakura, Sai.

140
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,035
Hinata, are you feeling better already?

141
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,411
Yeah!

142
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,080
But still, how did she...?

143
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,420
I see, her Byakugan...

144
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,382
<i>We'd better be careful with
that little girl's jutsu.</i>

145
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:24,678
<i>Even if we were in a smoke screen,
she would find us...</i>

146
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,388
<i>Damn it!</i>

147
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:29,768
What kind of place is this?!

148
00:13:29,885 --> 00:13:34,473
There are no waves,
and I don't see any fish.

149
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:35,982
It's really weird...

150
00:13:38,406 --> 00:13:39,949
I see something.

151
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:52,665
Oh! It's a turtle!
There's a turtle inside!

152
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:57,713
Brother! What kind of turtle is this?

153
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:02,009
Na-Naruto, th-this is a Tailed Beast!

154
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:03,468
Tailed Beast?

155
00:14:03,522 --> 00:14:05,315
Yeah! It's the Three-Tails!

156
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,901
Three-Tails...?

157
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,135
<i>Even that huge jutsu couldn't stop it?!</i>

158
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,305
Guren! Take Yuukimaru and run!

159
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,181
Gozu! You, too!

160
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,436
Gozu, protect Yuukimaru!

161
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,937
All right!

162
00:14:58,899 --> 00:14:59,714
Guren...!

163
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,195
You fight with me!

164
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,410
She's...!

165
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,541
Why is she fighting with the Three-Tails?!

166
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,090
Guren!

167
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:33,225
What are you doing here...?!

168
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,043
Don't tell me...

169
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:43,319
<i>Where there's someone thinking of me,
that's where I go home to.</i>

170
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:48,532
His place to return is...
with them?!

171
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:54,038
Don't underestimate me...
Filthy turtle!

172
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,164
Guren!

173
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:09,511
<i>This camellia will never wither.</i>

174
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,263
<i>As long as I'm alive.</i>

175
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:17,535
Guren...

176
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:19,812
Gozu...!

177
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,898
What are you doing?!

178
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:26,862
Take Yuukimaru and...
get out of here!

179
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:28,864
Guren...

180
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:45,130
I figured out where to return home to.

181
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:47,313
You...

182
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:12,032
What?! The Three-Tails
has stopped moving.

183
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,407
It can't be...!

184
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:17,162
He... can control the Three-Tails?!

185
00:17:51,864 --> 00:17:52,865
What?!

186
00:17:53,451 --> 00:17:54,452
Kakashi-senpai!

187
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:56,785
That's...!

188
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,334
What?!

189
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:14,928
<i>That's the dimension where
the Three-Tails appeared!</i>

190
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,721
<i>If we're swallowed by it...!</i>

191
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:24,479
<i>Are you all right?</i>

192
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:27,858
<i>So warm...</i>

193
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:34,657
<i>Here!</i>

194
00:18:34,907 --> 00:18:36,367
<i>You... This is...!</i>

195
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:40,371
<i>Yuukimaru...!</i>

196
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:54,843
<i>All my chakra is going to this jutsu...!</i>

197
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,705
What an impressive Tailed Beast.

198
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,833
The ordinary method
doesn't work, after all.

199
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:14,338
Well, it doesn't matter...
I'll just move on to the next step.

200
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:27,643
Hey, are you all right?

201
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,561
Yeah... more or less.

202
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,444
It doesn't seem like
the Leaf ninja are nearby.

203
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,113
But I can't figure out the situation.

204
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,825
Say, what was that huge wave just now?

205
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,536
And I heard a cry of some sort...

206
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,539
Just what are Guren
and the others doing...?

207
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:53,001
It's probably better for us
if we don't know.

208
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,375
Oh, Gozu... You're alive.

209
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,639
Yeah... Where's Guren?

210
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:06,974
I dunno.

211
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,142
You should be able to find her!

212
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:14,439
We'd like nothing better,
but suddenly the bats stopped responding.

213
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,733
Frankly, I'm stumped.

214
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,571
Where do you think you're going?

215
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,283
She may be injured...

216
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,077
Hey, finding her is...
Hey Gozu!

217
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:37,462
Oh, man. He's got a crush on her.

218
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,132
Owww...

219
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:44,261
Damn it! I was put through hell.

220
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:47,264
How far did I get washed away?

221
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,016
I know!

222
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,267
Him...?

223
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:57,941
What was he doing with
Orochimaru's ally?

224
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:01,405
<i>Now listen, follow that person!</i>

225
00:22:01,511 --> 00:22:03,180
<i>Don't let that person go!</i>

226
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:04,906
<i>Uh-huh...!</i>

227
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:08,910
That kid...
Could it have been my fault...?!

228
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:16,314
Damn it! This fog...!

229
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:33,643
Where am I?

230
00:22:41,904 --> 00:22:42,655
Sasuke?!

231
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,990
<i>Don't interfere.</i>

232
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:47,824
Why you--!

233
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,534
What are you going to do with Sasuke?!

234
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:54,039
<i>I'm going to begin
the Reanimation Jutsu.</i>

235
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:55,499
What...?!

236
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:58,753
<i>That is his wish.</i>

237
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:04,385
<i>He will attain power...
And I will attain him.</i>

238
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,426
As if I'd let you!

239
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,137
We're going to take Sasuke
back to our village!

240
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:14,726
<i>How silly.
He doesn't desire such a thing.</i>

241
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:21,441
Still, home is where people
think of you. I believe that...

242
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,152
<i>I wonder if that's true...</i>

243
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,199
Shut up...!

244
00:23:29,493 --> 00:23:32,830
<i>You... will regret it.</i>

245
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,038
Shut up!

246
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:37,877
<i>Stop! Naruto!</i>

247
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,259
Phew... That was close.

248
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:47,008
Kakashi-sensei...?!

249
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:51,598
Look, we finally found you.
What do you think you're doing?!

250
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,141
Huh?! But Orochimaru was right here...

251
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:57,811
Huh? I don't pick up any scents.

252
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:00,230
It seems... that was an illusion.

253
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,107
Huh...? But...

254
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,070
Are you all right, Naruto?

255
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:08,989
We've assembled everyone.

256
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,033
But it doesn't mean
our problems are over.

257
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,034
Hmm?

258
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,412
Look...

259
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:18,999
This is...?!

260
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:21,712
They've started acting strangely.

261
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:26,800
They've lost their sense of direction.
We can't use them for reconnaissance.

262
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:28,844
Hey, hey, are you serious...?

263
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:32,304
It started after the fog became thicker.

264
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,015
On our side, Naruto saw an illusion.

265
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,559
It seems this is no ordinary fog.

266
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,521
Naruto... What happened at that lake?

267
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,689
Huh?

268
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:50,280
There was... this giant rampaging turtle.

269
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:53,326
Those guys we fought earlier
were fighting it.

270
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:54,165
Hmm?

271
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:56,371
What...? A turtle...?!

272
00:24:56,745 --> 00:25:01,541
Hey... are you saying that
giant chakra was actually a turtle?

273
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,878
Shut up! I'm telling the truth!

274
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:08,757
Anyway, the turtle caused
that giant wave!

275
00:25:09,176 --> 00:25:13,222
Gamakichi saw that thing and
said it was a Three-Tails...

276
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:19,392
Three-Tails...?!
A Tailed Beast appeared here?

277
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:23,772
Probably... It's not like
he actually counted its tails, though.

278
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:25,357
Senpai...

279
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,985
Just when I thought we figured out
their target...

280
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,613
We've come across
another puzzling thing...

281
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:36,036
In any case, we must retreat to
somewhere this fog can't reach us.

282
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,788
We'll go through all our data
and plan our next strategy.

283
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:10,694
<i>Why didn't you kill him?</i>

284
00:26:41,493 --> 00:26:43,203
<i>What was that just now...?</i>

285
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:44,855
Guren...

286
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,064
Yuukimaru...?

287
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:55,822
<i>I see... I fought with the Three-Tails
and lost consciousness.</i>

288
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:00,827
<i>I never imagined that the Three-Tails
would have such power...</i>

289
00:27:02,122 --> 00:27:05,584
<i>That raging current probably
swallowed up the rest.</i>

290
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,376
<i>If the Hidden Leaf are on the move,</i>

291
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:12,339
<i>I need to regroup with Rinji and the others,
but in this fog...</i>

292
00:27:14,468 --> 00:27:16,220
What happened to the Three-Tails?

293
00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:20,613
I don't know...
It suddenly got quiet...

294
00:27:21,402 --> 00:27:22,205
I see...

295
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:27,020
But I'm glad. That you woke up...

296
00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:30,859
You were moaning the whole time...

297
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:33,069
You wouldn't wake up,

298
00:27:33,094 --> 00:27:35,059
no matter how many times
I called out your name...

299
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:37,364
<i>I get it...</i>

300
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:41,493
<i>He stayed by me
the whole time I was unconscious...</i>

301
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:46,206
Now then. Shall we go find the others?

302
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,167
Uh-huh. But I wonder...

303
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:50,418
What?

304
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,714
It's strange...
I don't have any strength in my body.

305
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:01,640
You have a fever again!
Since when...?

306
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,096
<i>Byakugan!</i>

307
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,494
Oh! Amazing...!

308
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:26,663
Did you see something?

309
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,457
Yes. Let's go back.

310
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:30,667
All right...

311
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:37,799
How did it go?

312
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:41,553
Yes... That's definitely not an ordinary fog.

313
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,973
There's quite a bit of chakra inside it.

314
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,476
Furthermore, it has totally
enveloped the lake.

315
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:50,355
It's a considerable amount of chakra.

316
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:55,442
I guess we're right to conclude that
the fog was produced by the Three-Tails.

317
00:28:55,736 --> 00:28:56,696
Yes...

318
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:59,114
According to what Naruto said,

319
00:28:59,406 --> 00:29:01,867
that fog has the power to
make you hallucinate.

320
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,409
It's like a kind of barrier.

321
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,203
It's dangerous to approach the lake.

322
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:10,415
That's bad!
He's still inside there...!

323
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:11,876
He...?

324
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:18,214
Remember Sakura, I told you before.
I met him on the way here.

325
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,507
Oh, that's right...

326
00:29:19,927 --> 00:29:22,408
Oh, when you were delirious...

327
00:29:22,433 --> 00:29:25,853
Quit being so rude!
Anyway, he's still on the lake!

328
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,475
Inside the fog...!

329
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,310
The lake?

330
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:34,355
Please, Kakashi-sensei!
He's not a ninja!

331
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:36,524
I have to find out if he's okay...

332
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:39,319
Sorry, Naruto. I can't allow it...

333
00:29:39,785 --> 00:29:40,786
Kakashi-sensei!

334
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:43,700
Earlier, you were ensnared
by the Three-Tails' illusion

335
00:29:43,992 --> 00:29:46,693
and almost ended up killing
your comrade.

336
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,162
Acting on your own
is out of the question.

337
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,831
I... I know that, but...

338
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:56,753
But Kakashi-sensei...
The problem is... what'll we do now?

339
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,505
Whatever has developed,

340
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:02,383
we've fallen far off track from
searching for Orochimaru's hideout.

341
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:09,057
Well, the situation has escalated
beyond my authority to make a decision.

342
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:13,228
And so, I've already sent Pakkun
back to Hidden Leaf Village.

343
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:17,482
We'll wait here until we get orders
from Lady Tsunade.

344
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:21,611
In the meantime, stay outside
the perimeter of the fog

345
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,780
and keep an eye on
the Three-Tails and those others.

346
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:24,781
Understood?

347
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:25,865
- Yes!
- Yes!

348
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,664
That's the gist of it.

349
00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:38,881
I had heard that the Three-Tails
disappeared after the last Great War.

350
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,006
But to have it reappear in this form...

351
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:46,886
Orochimaru has gotten involved
in something troubling.

352
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:51,599
But the Akatsuki are desperately
searching for Tailed Beasts.

353
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:56,771
Perhaps the fact that we discovered it
first is a blessing in disguise.

354
00:30:57,149 --> 00:31:00,694
Yes... But if the Akatsuki get wind of this,

355
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:03,780
it's certain to turn into a tug-of-war
for the Three-Tails.

356
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,422
We cannot hand it over to anyone.

357
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,616
You'll capture it then?

358
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,119
I don't think it will be easy...

359
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,873
However, there must be
some kind of precedent...

360
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,634
I'm going to look it up in
our existing documents.

361
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:26,885
I want you to summon
the members I've written there.

362
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,803
Understood!

363
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:40,108
All done...

364
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:43,276
Thank you for your help today.

365
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:44,696
Really...?!

366
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,530
Yes... Please keep up the good work.

367
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:48,740
Yes!

368
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:58,043
I can't go on...

369
00:31:58,168 --> 00:32:02,131
We're just beginning, Tenten.
The real challenge begins now!

370
00:32:02,673 --> 00:32:03,935
Well said, Lee!

371
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:08,345
Words of weakness in the midst
of your youth are forbidden, Tenten!

372
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:09,135
Right!

373
00:32:09,388 --> 00:32:13,559
To be mutually aware of one's partner
and to watch each other's back!

374
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:18,015
To hone one's skills in taijutsu
to form an unbeatable combination.

375
00:32:18,021 --> 00:32:19,421
Let us do that!

376
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:24,525
And trying to keep up with
all your showboating is wearing me out!

377
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:28,613
Hmm?! Lee, what is the purpose
of this training?

378
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,489
Huh?

379
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:35,662
Coordination with one's partners.
It's training to build up synergy!

380
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:36,788
Correct!

381
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:40,500
However, do you think you are
in harmony with Tenten right now?

382
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,338
<i>She's breathing hard... Oh no!</i>

383
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,674
I understand, Sensei.

384
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:50,343
It seems my feelings have
gotten ahead of hers.

385
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:54,138
That's my student!
You catch on quickly!

386
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,434
Man, we've been at this nonstop
for five hours.

387
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,937
No matter how much stamina I have,
I can't keep this up.

388
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:02,772
I still have a lot left in me!

389
00:33:02,941 --> 00:33:04,276
Well said, Lee!

390
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:07,568
As soon as Tenten has caught her breath,
we'll resume training!

391
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,238
I'm going to perform a taijutsu attack
without holding back,

392
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,865
so counter me with all your might!

393
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,242
Right, Guy-sensei!

394
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,121
<i>We're going to continue anyway...?</i>

395
00:33:20,709 --> 00:33:22,502
Wait, look...!

396
00:33:23,462 --> 00:33:25,130
We're being called up?

397
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,047
All right.
We'll continue after you get back!

398
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:33,886
Go, you two! Show them the results
of your long, arduous training!

399
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,304
- Right!
- Yes!

400
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,768
And that's the gist of the situation.

401
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:44,439
You will go to support Kakashi
and the others

402
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,190
who have gone ahead of you.

403
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:48,317
You are probably aware by now

404
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:51,154
that the most critical thing is
to seal the Three-Tails.

405
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:55,533
Sealing the Three-Tails will require
extremely delicate chakra control.

406
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,494
medical ninja consisting
of myself and Ino;

407
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,833
plus Sakura and Hinata,
who are already there,

408
00:34:00,865 --> 00:34:02,450
will form the Sealing unit.

409
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:04,252
Right! I'll do my best!

410
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,294
Lee and Tenten,

411
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:09,058
I need you to cover for Hinata
and Sakura while they're gone.

412
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:12,050
As long as the enemy is after
the Three-Tails,

413
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,052
confrontation will be inevitable.

414
00:34:14,847 --> 00:34:16,099
You can count on us!

415
00:34:16,124 --> 00:34:18,585
We'll fight with the full power
of our youth!

416
00:34:19,101 --> 00:34:22,896
I will lead you to the site.
Don't fall behind!

417
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:39,494
<i>Seriously... It’s no good if the one
looking after him collapses too.</i>

418
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:47,376
<i>This is my second time
taking care of him...</i>

419
00:34:51,466 --> 00:34:53,134
<i>If you give him that much medicine...</i>

420
00:34:54,636 --> 00:34:56,930
<i>Could those pills be the cause...?</i>

421
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:04,062
<i>In any case, I must avoid a battle
with the enemy while I have him.</i>

422
00:35:08,567 --> 00:35:10,652
Hey, Yuukimaru. Wake up.

423
00:35:12,529 --> 00:35:18,910
You know...
The place I can return to... is by you.

424
00:35:19,453 --> 00:35:20,204
Huh?

425
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:23,374
I finally... found it.

426
00:35:37,846 --> 00:35:42,267
We're supposed to be on watch
until the next shift. That Naruto!

427
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:03,663
Don't slack off.

428
00:36:03,991 --> 00:36:04,700
Huh?

429
00:36:05,412 --> 00:36:09,958
Sakura... I've been thinking...

430
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:11,377
Huh?

431
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:15,468
But I can't find an answer by myself.

432
00:36:18,637 --> 00:36:22,349
Back then, when I was training...
the Pervy Sage said something to me.

433
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:23,850
Jiraiya?

434
00:36:24,447 --> 00:36:28,284
"Wherever someone thinks of you,
that's where home is."

435
00:36:29,356 --> 00:36:30,732
That's a nice saying.

436
00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:34,943
But... is that really true?

437
00:36:37,906 --> 00:36:40,701
If that's true, then if we keep
thinking about someone,

438
00:36:40,826 --> 00:36:42,702
that person would return, right?

439
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,376
Yes... I'd like to think that.

440
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:57,317
But no matter how much we think of
someone, there are some who won't return.

441
00:36:57,968 --> 00:37:02,347
It's a very difficult thing...
to have your thoughts reach someone.

442
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:09,268
Yet, if you give up... and there's no one
to think about that person...

443
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,020
That's sad.

444
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:18,486
Yes. If we give up, then there really
won't be a place to return to.

445
00:37:18,947 --> 00:37:19,948
Yes!

446
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:23,994
No matter what anyone says,
we just have to keep thinking of him...

447
00:37:24,019 --> 00:37:26,939
and create a place where
he can return freely at any time.

448
00:37:28,415 --> 00:37:29,291
Sakura!

449
00:37:30,459 --> 00:37:31,418
Okay?

450
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:37,088
You're right.
We just can't give up. Right!

451
00:37:37,883 --> 00:37:40,177
I feel much better,
thanks to you, Sakura!

452
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,303
I'm going back to my position.

453
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:48,307
In thirty minutes,
the next two-man team will relieve us.

454
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,351
So stay alert.

455
00:37:51,522 --> 00:37:53,398
Thank you! Sakura...

456
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:58,901
She's right...

457
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:05,950
<i>So if someone is thinking about me,
then that's the place I go back to?</i>

458
00:38:07,621 --> 00:38:11,542
<i>Yup... No matter what anyone says,
just keep thinking about him.</i>

459
00:38:14,336 --> 00:38:18,506
<i>But... if he really has no place to go...</i>

460
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,090
<i>I'll be the one he can come home to.</i>

461
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,224
Are we getting close
to our destination?

462
00:38:30,602 --> 00:38:34,621
At this rate, we'll get there
around noon tomorrow.

463
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:39,734
Stop asking me the same question
every five minutes!

464
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:43,362
Lee, don't be so antsy!

465
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:49,243
What are you saying?! Our comrades
are anxiously waiting for us!

466
00:38:49,538 --> 00:38:53,875
Our mission is to move at full speed
and get there as soon as possible!

467
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,668
You waste so much energy...

468
00:38:58,377 --> 00:38:59,378
Shizune-senpai...

469
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,087
Hmm?

470
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:03,007
If the enemy has made contact
with the Three-Tails...

471
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,217
That means they have a jutsu

472
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,345
to take the Three-Tails
into their possession, right?

473
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:11,932
Yes. Probably a Sealing Jutsu,
or some jutsu we don't know about.

474
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:15,853
Once we get there, we'll have to use
our Sealing Jutsu immediately.

475
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,064
We can't have them beat us to it.

476
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:19,940
Then it's decided!

477
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:23,402
Let's pick up our pace to twice,
no, three times the speed!

478
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,280
Not that nonsense again...

479
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:30,409
But I fully agree.
Pakkun, lead the way!

480
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:34,372
Seems I have no choice.
Everyone, don't fall behind!

481
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,473
Well, that's about it.

482
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,771
What do you think, Senpai?

483
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,065
Yeah, looks good.

484
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:13,965
You haven't turned a page in a while.
Is something on your mind?

485
00:40:14,347 --> 00:40:15,033
Hmm?

486
00:40:15,562 --> 00:40:17,272
Oh, this and that...

487
00:40:18,752 --> 00:40:24,049
Yamato, how do you think those guys
intended to capture the Three-Tails?

488
00:40:24,716 --> 00:40:28,053
Well, it's a Tailed Beast, after all...

489
00:40:28,762 --> 00:40:30,889
Our opponent's Crystal Style
is powerful,

490
00:40:31,056 --> 00:40:33,392
but I doubt that it's enough
to suppress the Tailed Beast...

491
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:37,518
Which means they must have been using
another method at the same time.

492
00:40:38,814 --> 00:40:43,736
But back then, we weren't restrained
for very long.

493
00:40:45,529 --> 00:40:46,697
I can't believe that they were able

494
00:40:46,722 --> 00:40:49,850
to set up such an elaborate ritual
in that time.

495
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,699
That's true...

496
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:55,744
But didn't Naruto say he saw
a child by the lake?

497
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,746
That bothers me...

498
00:40:58,375 --> 00:41:03,380
On top of that, we'll be facing
that Crystal Style user very soon...

499
00:41:05,257 --> 00:41:06,155
Where are you going?

500
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:09,191
Let's analyze the situation and
do whatever we can now.

501
00:41:13,891 --> 00:41:15,017
Kakashi-sensei...

502
00:41:15,517 --> 00:41:20,272
Sorry to interrupt,
but I want to discuss something.

503
00:41:23,483 --> 00:41:24,347
Okay...

504
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:40,915
<i>Umm... you're the one I come back to.</i>

505
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:44,877
<i>Come back to... huh...?</i>

506
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,391
I wonder where he went.

507
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:05,523
He's from the Hidden Leaf...

508
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:10,611
It'll be a bother if he gets any closer.

509
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:15,950
Don't move from this spot.

510
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,748
I'm here to relieve you.

511
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:26,001
Right. So far, there's been
nothing unusual.

512
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:27,545
- Um... Sakura...
- Huh?

513
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:29,838
- Sai?
- Hey!

514
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,174
This isn't your position.

515
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,052
Oh, I know that, but...

516
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,471
Do you know where Naruto is?

517
00:42:37,915 --> 00:42:39,875
Huh? Isn't he in his assigned spot?

518
00:42:40,435 --> 00:42:42,562
Well, I don't see him.

519
00:42:42,938 --> 00:42:45,106
That guy, did he go back early?

520
00:42:45,654 --> 00:42:48,281
If so, we would've crossed paths...

521
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:51,784
You're right. Even Naruto wouldn't
just abandon his post...!

522
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:53,654
No way...

523
00:42:58,662 --> 00:43:03,375
If that wave took him,
there wouldn't be any trace left...

524
00:43:05,419 --> 00:43:06,308
Who are you?!

525
00:43:06,718 --> 00:43:10,556
You should be grateful!
I came just for you.

526
00:43:11,175 --> 00:43:12,176
You're...

527
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:14,219
Lurking around all by yourself...

528
00:43:15,012 --> 00:43:18,849
If your purpose was to spy,
you came across the worst opponent.

529
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:24,018
It seems this is no illusion...

530
00:43:25,689 --> 00:43:27,483
<i>Crystal Style: Jade Crystal Blade!</i>

531
00:43:30,611 --> 00:43:31,502
Die!

532
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:42,682
I'm not spying!

533
00:43:43,207 --> 00:43:44,625
I'm searching!

534
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:47,786
For that kid who was with you!

535
00:43:52,925 --> 00:43:55,302
Answer me! Where is he?!

536
00:44:03,018 --> 00:44:04,019
Guren...?

537
00:44:12,653 --> 00:44:15,447
I... have to go.

538
00:44:16,657 --> 00:44:19,368
What?! Naruto has disappeared?

539
00:44:19,952 --> 00:44:22,580
What is the possibility that
he came under attack?

540
00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:25,639
I didn't pick up
any suspicious scents at the site.

541
00:44:26,374 --> 00:44:29,669
I think he just took off on his own.

542
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:33,295
He seemed to have something
on his mind...

543
00:44:33,966 --> 00:44:35,301
But to go off like this...

544
00:44:35,843 --> 00:44:36,844
Naruto...

545
00:44:37,029 --> 00:44:40,991
Honestly... In any case, we have
to find Naruto at once.

546
00:44:41,306 --> 00:44:42,223
Then we all...

547
00:44:42,248 --> 00:44:44,208
No, like I said before...

548
00:44:44,726 --> 00:44:46,728
It's dangerous to go
into the fog recklessly.

549
00:44:47,161 --> 00:44:49,455
Yamato and I will search for him.

550
00:44:50,816 --> 00:44:51,817
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

551
00:44:54,444 --> 00:44:57,113
It's very rare for you to summon me.

552
00:44:57,698 --> 00:45:02,578
Pakkun is out on a mission, so Biscuit,
I need you to find Naruto right away.

553
00:45:03,078 --> 00:45:04,079
Gotcha.

554
00:45:04,818 --> 00:45:06,820
Shino, Kiba and Hinata,
search outside the fog.

555
00:45:07,545 --> 00:45:10,215
Sakura and Sai will do
aerial reconnaissance.

556
00:45:10,706 --> 00:45:11,707
- Yes!
- Yes!

557
00:45:11,843 --> 00:45:14,221
Do not act alone.

558
00:45:15,841 --> 00:45:18,760
Where is the little kid?
Is he okay?!

559
00:45:19,386 --> 00:45:22,222
<i>This guy...
Why's he asking about Yuukimaru...?</i>

560
00:45:23,098 --> 00:45:25,893
<i>I see... He was watching that...</i>

561
00:45:26,768 --> 00:45:29,187
Well, it's none of your business!

562
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,228
It is my business!

563
00:45:35,068 --> 00:45:36,069
So petty!

564
00:45:42,826 --> 00:45:46,246
Tell me! I need to take him back!

565
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,162
Are you crazy?

566
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:51,749
Take him back?
He was on our side from the beginning.

567
00:45:51,919 --> 00:45:56,298
No! It's all my fault that
he ended up going back to your side!

568
00:45:56,798 --> 00:45:59,467
All because of the unnecessary stuff
I said to him...

569
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,133
Unnecessary?

570
00:46:02,304 --> 00:46:05,558
Thank you.
You taught me, didn't you?

571
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:07,308
Y-You...

572
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:08,724
Yuukimaru...

573
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:13,562
Wherever someone thinks of you
is the place you go home to...

574
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:14,938
Hey, don't move!

575
00:46:15,442 --> 00:46:17,476
I'm really grateful.

576
00:46:18,153 --> 00:46:20,864
I finally found the place
where I can go back to.

577
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:22,488
Right, Guren?

578
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:24,495
Sorry.

579
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,118
Yuukimaru!

580
00:46:28,247 --> 00:46:29,248
Don't move!

581
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:34,170
So you were hiding one
of your Shadow Clones.

582
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:35,671
Guren!

583
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:38,712
So your name is Yuukimaru?

584
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:40,631
I'm Naruto.

585
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:43,467
Naruto...

586
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:47,679
Yuukimaru, you're going home
with me to Hidden Leaf Village.

587
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,348
Why?

588
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:52,851
She's not the one you're going home to!

589
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,397
She serves Orochimaru.

590
00:46:57,856 --> 00:47:01,944
And this guy Orochimaru will
do anything to achieve his ambition.

591
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:05,697
He's a bastard who thinks nothing
of taking people's lives.

592
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:10,118
Anyone who serves a guy like
that can't be a decent human being!

593
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:13,038
Guren will protect me...

594
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:18,335
She's kind to me and she thinks of me...

595
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:22,047
It's obvious she's just using you!

596
00:47:22,259 --> 00:47:22,988
Shut up!

597
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:30,222
His home isn't with you!

598
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:31,682
Guren...

599
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:32,564
<i>Something's coming...</i>

600
00:47:34,813 --> 00:47:35,980
<i>The Hidden Leaf...</i>

601
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,272
I'm taking him by force, if necessary!

602
00:47:41,028 --> 00:47:43,573
<i>Hexagonal Crystal Shuriken:
Wild Dance!</i>

603
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:50,367
What?!

604
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:51,702
Take this!

605
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:01,587
I won't let you get away!

606
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:05,299
Naruto, stop!

607
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,345
Stabilized and secured.

608
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:11,972
Let me go!

609
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:13,098
I'm taking him...!

610
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:16,518
It's no use. They've disappeared.

611
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,064
Damn it...

612
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:30,407
Guren, are you hurt?

613
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,118
Don't bother me!

614
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:41,627
<i>She's not the one you're going home to.</i>

615
00:48:43,006 --> 00:48:46,009
<i>That kid... When I see him again...</i>

616
00:48:46,385 --> 00:48:48,929
I'm sorry... But...

617
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:53,180
I'm glad you're all right.

618
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:01,563
Yuukimaru!

619
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,197
I'm going back.

620
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,036
Right. Thanks.

621
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:15,911
What's with you?

622
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,497
Surely, you knew that if
you went off on your own,

623
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:22,292
you knew you'd run into
that Crystal Style user?

624
00:49:22,796 --> 00:49:23,797
I know.

625
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:26,838
But I... I just had to find him...

626
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:28,048
Don't make excuses.

627
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:31,343
You're lucky; you could've
been dead by now.

628
00:49:32,222 --> 00:49:34,933
You put your comrades in danger
because you gave in to your emotions.

629
00:49:35,431 --> 00:49:37,394
How can you face Lady Tsunade,

630
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:40,560
who put her trust in you and
sent you on this mission?

631
00:49:43,483 --> 00:49:44,839
Alright, I get it.

632
00:49:51,325 --> 00:49:54,996
This mission involves a dangerous,
unpredictable foe.

633
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,290
Recklessly acting on your own
could spell death for everyone.

634
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:02,252
Don't let yourself forget that.

635
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:03,716
Right.

636
00:50:04,087 --> 00:50:05,547
Shall we return?

637
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:06,991
Yes.

638
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:11,549
By the way, Naruto,
you said you saw a child at the lake.

639
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:13,429
Huh? What about it?

640
00:50:14,366 --> 00:50:18,787
Something's been bothering me.
Tell me the details of that incident.

641
00:50:35,911 --> 00:50:38,413
Guren! I'm glad you're okay.

642
00:50:39,164 --> 00:50:43,252
Sorry. But I couldn't use my search net
near the lake.

643
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:48,172
Forget it... It seems we haven't
lost any fighting power...

644
00:50:48,882 --> 00:50:52,635
Although, there's at least one
I would've preferred to lose.

645
00:50:52,987 --> 00:50:55,740
So I'm blessed with the luck of evil.
It's mutual.

646
00:50:59,782 --> 00:51:02,403
He's weakened, but it's tolerable.

647
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:06,689
He's exhausted. Let him rest.

648
00:51:07,293 --> 00:51:08,586
Unfortunately...

649
00:51:08,662 --> 00:51:11,665
I don't think we can afford to
hang around here.

650
00:51:28,005 --> 00:51:32,384
I just can't imagine why those guys
would take an ordinary kid along,

651
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:35,842
when they're facing the huge challenge
of capturing the Three-Tails.

652
00:51:36,221 --> 00:51:37,931
He's no ordinary kid, I tell you...

653
00:51:38,724 --> 00:51:43,145
What if he possesses some
special power against the Three-Tails?

654
00:51:46,315 --> 00:51:47,441
Now that you mention it...

655
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:49,836
He did something and...

656
00:51:51,987 --> 00:51:54,281
it seemed as though
the Three-Tails stopped moving.

657
00:51:59,536 --> 00:52:00,537
It figures...

658
00:52:00,725 --> 00:52:03,811
You mean a human was
controlling a Tailed Beast?

659
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:08,625
I don't know what trick they used,
but we're dealing with Orochimaru...

660
00:52:09,505 --> 00:52:11,548
It's probably no mistake

661
00:52:11,573 --> 00:52:14,034
that they intend to use a child
to capture the Three-Tails.

662
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:19,181
Which means, this child...
We can't just ignore him.

663
00:52:19,765 --> 00:52:21,684
What do you mean by that?

664
00:52:21,973 --> 00:52:24,350
We'll wait for an opportunity,
and then we'll secure him.

665
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:25,713
Secure him?

666
00:52:25,738 --> 00:52:27,198
As long as they don't have the boy,

667
00:52:27,231 --> 00:52:30,275
they have no method to
capture the Three-Tails.

668
00:52:30,442 --> 00:52:31,860
And I can't believe that

669
00:52:31,961 --> 00:52:34,588
Orochimaru will be satisfied with
just capturing the Three-Tails...

670
00:52:34,947 --> 00:52:36,240
Sooner or later,

671
00:52:36,265 --> 00:52:39,686
he'll think of ways to create
a Jinchuriki that is easy to control.

672
00:52:41,036 --> 00:52:44,999
For him, a boy with the ability
to synergize with a Tailed Beast

673
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:47,164
is merely a useful tool.

674
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:49,749
I won't let him do that!

675
00:52:50,003 --> 00:52:51,004
You're absolutely right.

676
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:56,464
Besides, I'm sure they would want
to examine his powers back at the village.

677
00:52:57,594 --> 00:53:01,514
Well, it all depends
on Lady Tsunade's reply.

678
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:09,060
Naruto!

679
00:53:09,147 --> 00:53:10,148
Sakura!

680
00:53:16,947 --> 00:53:19,325
Is this what they call... "tough love"?

681
00:53:24,788 --> 00:53:28,751
This is far more effective
than us trying to lecture him.

682
00:53:32,296 --> 00:53:35,925
Kakashi-sensei,
I gave Naruto an earful.

683
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,843
Was he sorry?

684
00:53:38,844 --> 00:53:41,597
I'm so... sorry...

685
00:53:42,181 --> 00:53:43,808
Never mind that.
There's good news!

686
00:53:44,493 --> 00:53:45,911
Reinforcements from the Hidden Leaf?

687
00:53:46,358 --> 00:53:48,235
The enemy is reacting quickly.

688
00:53:48,655 --> 00:53:51,366
No doubt, they will try to seal
the Three-Tails.

689
00:53:51,857 --> 00:53:54,860
No way! The Three-Tails belongs
to Lord Orochimaru.

690
00:53:55,402 --> 00:53:58,155
Of course!
And that is why, this time, Guren...

691
00:53:58,353 --> 00:54:02,149
You must use Yuukimaru
to suppress the Three-Tails.

692
00:54:04,036 --> 00:54:06,288
But Yuukimaru is still...

693
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:10,667
Don't worry. If we build up his stamina
and allow him to rest a bit,

694
00:54:10,692 --> 00:54:11,944
we'll be able to use him.

695
00:54:19,968 --> 00:54:22,220
<i>He's going to give him that drug again...</i>

696
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:27,350
But Yuukimaru still looks awfully weak.

697
00:54:27,893 --> 00:54:30,645
If you force him...
Are you sure he'll be all right?

698
00:54:30,896 --> 00:54:32,439
Well, I wonder...

699
00:54:34,107 --> 00:54:36,234
Don't look at me like that.

700
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:42,070
You should know that Yuukimaru is
simply a tool to capture the Three-Tails.

701
00:54:42,824 --> 00:54:45,977
Unless we make use of him now,
there's no meaning in his very existence.

702
00:54:47,454 --> 00:54:51,417
But if he collapses and the plan fails...

703
00:54:51,834 --> 00:54:53,961
My credibility will be totally ruined!

704
00:54:54,795 --> 00:54:58,883
Guren, I'm hoping that
the plan is a success.

705
00:54:59,842 --> 00:55:01,635
That's why I...

706
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:04,843
Well, it's irritating.

707
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:08,320
You tend to stick your nose into
other people's business too often.

708
00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:11,186
Guren... You...

709
00:55:11,436 --> 00:55:12,562
The main thing is to prevent

710
00:55:12,587 --> 00:55:14,631
the Hidden Leaf from sealing
the Three-Tails, right?

711
00:55:14,815 --> 00:55:18,444
Well then, I'll destroy the Leaf!

712
00:55:31,123 --> 00:55:32,625
Had an argument?

713
00:55:33,083 --> 00:55:37,045
I can't stand that four-eyed bastard!

714
00:55:37,963 --> 00:55:39,590
Does he want to kill Yuukimaru?

715
00:55:40,257 --> 00:55:41,258
Oh...

716
00:55:42,301 --> 00:55:43,093
What?

717
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:47,337
It's unlike you to worry
so much about Yuukimaru.

718
00:55:48,265 --> 00:55:53,186
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm just concerned about our mission.

719
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,857
Concerned about the mission, eh...?

720
00:56:00,068 --> 00:56:02,529
Reinforcements are here? Who?

721
00:56:02,682 --> 00:56:04,601
Just wait and see.

722
00:56:06,909 --> 00:56:10,287
I've had it... I can't run any further.

723
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:12,622
Sakura, who's come to help...?

724
00:56:12,674 --> 00:56:15,593
You're so reckless, Naruto!

725
00:56:16,001 --> 00:56:18,837
It's okay! Recklessness and youth
go hand in hand!

726
00:56:19,421 --> 00:56:21,589
Stop affirming his actions!

727
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,760
Hey! You guys...!

728
00:56:30,474 --> 00:56:32,851
Oh! I'm glad you're here,
Bushy Brow!

729
00:56:33,393 --> 00:56:36,688
Everyone! Now that I'm here,
you have nothing to fear!

730
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:37,894
Hey!

731
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,939
It's "we're here." You are too eager.

732
00:56:42,236 --> 00:56:45,572
Well, you can relax.

733
00:56:45,906 --> 00:56:47,867
You're as confident as always,

734
00:56:47,919 --> 00:56:50,964
but have you mastered
the ABCs of medical ninjutsu?

735
00:56:50,994 --> 00:56:54,372
What?! For someone who started
medical ninjutsu just a tad before me,

736
00:56:54,397 --> 00:56:55,856
you sound pretty confident yourself.

737
00:56:55,916 --> 00:56:59,086
Well sure. It's not as though
I started yesterday.

738
00:56:59,336 --> 00:57:01,213
Well, you need that handicap.

739
00:57:01,258 --> 00:57:05,365
After all, we're not equals,
Billboard Brow.

740
00:57:05,515 --> 00:57:09,367
I haven't been called that
in a while... Ino Pig!

741
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:10,969
What?!

742
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:15,435
So their nicknames are
Billboard Brow and Ino Pig...?

743
00:57:15,894 --> 00:57:16,435
Huh?

744
00:57:22,609 --> 00:57:25,570
What... did... I...?

745
00:57:28,949 --> 00:57:31,744
Lady Tsunade briefed us on the basics.

746
00:57:32,244 --> 00:57:34,621
But can you give us the specifics
of the situation?

747
00:57:35,089 --> 00:57:37,800
Well, there's a new development...

748
00:57:38,709 --> 00:57:42,001
- What's with him?
- Let's do our best!

749
00:57:42,087 --> 00:57:43,505
What did I do?

750
00:57:43,714 --> 00:57:46,147
What were you writing?
Let's see it.

751
00:57:46,175 --> 00:57:47,593
Yes... We'll explain over there.

752
00:58:02,441 --> 00:58:05,902
There are four shinobi who can
move freely inside a smoke screen.

753
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:10,740
Also, the big guy I fought,
and then there's a Crystal Style user...

754
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:13,056
They were in the lake dealing
with a Tailed Beast

755
00:58:13,076 --> 00:58:15,537
which we believe is a Three-Tails.

756
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:18,915
Hmm... That was included
in our information.

757
00:58:19,666 --> 00:58:22,711
Well, we'd better get started quickly
so we can seal it.

758
00:58:23,295 --> 00:58:25,255
If the enemy takes possession of
the Three-Tails' fighting power,

759
00:58:25,415 --> 00:58:26,416
we're in trouble.

760
00:58:26,581 --> 00:58:30,544
There's one more thing...
a new development.

761
00:58:31,053 --> 00:58:31,704
Huh?!

762
00:58:32,513 --> 00:58:35,933
Naruto witnessed a child
at the lake.

763
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:39,649
And he says that child
controls the Tailed Beast.

764
00:58:40,395 --> 00:58:44,232
No way... Someone who can
control a Tailed Beast...?

765
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:49,447
Furthermore, Naruto later encountered
the child with the Crystal Style user.

766
00:58:49,571 --> 00:58:50,947
What's their relationship?

767
00:58:51,212 --> 00:58:52,464
It seems they're quite close...

768
00:58:52,783 --> 00:58:58,122
According to Naruto, the Crystal Style user
is the place the child can "return home" to.

769
00:58:58,622 --> 00:59:00,666
Just who is this child?

770
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,835
The Three-Tails doesn't have a Jinchuriki...

771
00:59:04,086 --> 00:59:07,317
Not yet...
After all, we're dealing with Orochimaru.

772
00:59:07,732 --> 00:59:10,819
Maybe he's aiming to make
that child a Jinchuriki.

773
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:14,304
It seems we have yet another
troubling thing to deal with.

774
00:59:16,807 --> 00:59:19,101
We knew we had to deal
with human foes,

775
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:21,891
but no one said a thing about
a Tailed Beast!

776
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:27,105
No kidding. That thing caused
a huge flood just by appearing.

777
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:29,315
What the hell are they starting?

778
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:32,819
But it's too late for us to run away.

779
00:59:33,031 --> 00:59:37,244
Say, think of a way we can get out of this.

780
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:41,415
We were lucky to make it
out of that camp alive.

781
00:59:41,832 --> 00:59:45,085
I'm not about to give my life
to some damned beast!

782
00:59:45,335 --> 00:59:48,213
We're counting on you, Rinji.

783
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:55,554
<i>Just how simple are
these guys anyway?</i>

784
00:59:57,514 --> 01:00:00,976
Look, I'll work things out.
Leave the rest to me.

785
01:00:01,446 --> 01:00:03,823
Just as I expected, Rinji!

786
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:08,985
Where are you going?

787
01:00:10,514 --> 01:00:13,309
If you're going to report to Guren,
I'll go.

788
01:00:14,364 --> 01:00:17,618
I can't trust you...

789
01:00:18,452 --> 01:00:21,121
Well, how you feel is up to you.

790
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:24,964
Do you intend to betray Guren?

791
01:00:30,774 --> 01:00:32,984
Whether I forgive you or not
depends on your answer...

792
01:00:35,677 --> 01:00:38,765
Contrary to what you believe,
my loyalties are with Guren.

793
01:00:39,264 --> 01:00:41,555
I wonder... about that...

794
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,563
This is just between you and me...

795
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:53,900
Why do you think I'm here?

796
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:58,863
I left a sickly kid sister back
in the village...

797
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:04,869
In order to protect her, I need money.

798
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:09,791
That's why...
I can't afford to lose my life here.

799
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,878
What you make of my story
is totally up to you.

800
01:01:31,149 --> 01:01:31,949
Oh?

801
01:01:34,069 --> 01:01:35,070
You're up?

802
01:01:37,406 --> 01:01:38,532
Where's Guren?

803
01:01:40,293 --> 01:01:41,294
Oh...

804
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:46,665
How about it?
Want to go back to Lord Orochimaru?

805
01:01:47,124 --> 01:01:48,918
Will Guren come with us?

806
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:54,410
Guren...? She's just a sacrifice
to Lord Orochimaru...

807
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:55,633
Huh?!

808
01:01:56,254 --> 01:02:00,591
Don't forget...
You belong to Lord Orochimaru.

809
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:05,471
No! The place I return to...
is the place where Guren is--!

810
01:02:09,563 --> 01:02:11,148
Move away from Yuukimaru!

811
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:12,645
Guren!

812
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:14,731
What do you intend to do to him?!

813
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:21,362
I'm... just disciplining him a bit.

814
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:24,031
I'm the one who's going to be
in trouble with Lord Orochimaru

815
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:25,616
if anything should happen
to Yuukimaru.

816
01:02:26,205 --> 01:02:29,333
I mustn't disappoint him.

817
01:02:31,376 --> 01:02:34,004
He wasn't able to even talk properly.

818
01:02:34,463 --> 01:02:36,715
I'm amazed at how much
you've taught him.

819
01:02:37,424 --> 01:02:42,513
If you ever lay a hand on Yuukimaru again,
I'll show you no mercy.

820
01:02:43,305 --> 01:02:46,975
Humph! Well then...
Keep a good eye on our test subject.

821
01:02:55,234 --> 01:02:56,235
Are you all right?

822
01:02:56,555 --> 01:02:59,391
Uh-huh! I'm going to stay
with you, right?

823
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:04,447
Guren... I don't want to go back
to the hideout.

824
01:03:21,677 --> 01:03:22,548
Rinji...?

825
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:27,678
Can you believe that?

826
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:33,184
She was so hung up on
Lord Orochimaru and now it's the kid...

827
01:03:33,647 --> 01:03:36,233
I hope it doesn't interfere
with her mission...

828
01:03:36,692 --> 01:03:39,278
I'm worried that she's getting
a bit too attached to him.

829
01:03:39,796 --> 01:03:42,757
Well, we'll just leave her
to Lord Orochimaru.

830
01:03:43,657 --> 01:03:46,452
I want you to continue
to watch her closely...

831
01:03:46,673 --> 01:03:48,810
and make sure she's not up to anything.

832
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,402
Continue... eh?

833
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:56,582
I'd be happy to be the one reporting
to Lord Orochimaru...

834
01:03:58,084 --> 01:03:59,085
You?

835
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:03,802
I've done many things for you
as your spy.

836
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:09,684
I posed as a convict at that prison and
got accepted by those reconstructed men

837
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:14,016
and sent you reports.
That was dangerous work.

838
01:04:14,897 --> 01:04:16,398
Even this job...

839
01:04:16,491 --> 01:04:18,910
It's because I'm putting my life
at risk like this...

840
01:04:18,935 --> 01:04:22,605
that you're able to get
the data you want.

841
01:04:23,697 --> 01:04:24,949
What are you trying to say?

842
01:04:25,238 --> 01:04:30,702
It's simple. I want you to value me
a little bit more.

843
01:04:31,038 --> 01:04:33,498
You want to cut a deal?

844
01:04:33,966 --> 01:04:35,384
No such thing...

845
01:04:35,961 --> 01:04:40,173
I've never considered myself
to be your subordinate.

846
01:04:40,631 --> 01:04:43,059
I serve Lord Orochimaru.

847
01:04:43,717 --> 01:04:44,473
Oh...

848
01:04:45,052 --> 01:04:50,526
I just want Lord Orochimaru himself
to recognize my efforts.

849
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:55,725
At least here, in this location,

850
01:04:55,854 --> 01:04:58,983
I'm the one who can get Kigiri, Kihou
and Nurari to act.

851
01:04:59,186 --> 01:05:02,106
I have more fighting power than you.

852
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:09,493
I mean, if you're the one who's killed
by the Hidden Leaf first,

853
01:05:10,035 --> 01:05:13,505
I can rush to Lord Orochimaru
and report it to him.

854
01:05:14,449 --> 01:05:17,009
All right, I'll let you see him.

855
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:20,587
But if you don't keep
your expectations realistic,

856
01:05:20,608 --> 01:05:22,443
you'll end up being destroyed...

857
01:05:28,679 --> 01:05:32,266
Now listen. It's going to get noisy
outside for a bit.

858
01:05:32,611 --> 01:05:34,475
Just be a good boy and wait here.

859
01:05:34,949 --> 01:05:36,034
What about you, Guren?

860
01:05:36,456 --> 01:05:39,418
As soon as I take care of some business,
I will come back. I promise.

861
01:05:39,982 --> 01:05:43,277
All you need to think about
is resting your body.

862
01:05:43,793 --> 01:05:47,129
I'm okay. I feel a little better.

863
01:05:47,427 --> 01:05:50,221
No, not yet.
You need to heal completely.

864
01:05:50,913 --> 01:05:53,457
Umm... I want to ask you for a favor...

865
01:05:56,623 --> 01:05:59,043
Can you... fix this?

866
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:01,165
I see...

867
01:06:05,382 --> 01:06:08,010
Rather than fixing this,
I'll make you a better one.

868
01:06:09,469 --> 01:06:10,470
But...

869
01:06:10,650 --> 01:06:11,651
What's the matter?

870
01:06:11,817 --> 01:06:16,238
I want to keep this one.
This is the first flower you gave me...

871
01:06:18,016 --> 01:06:19,075
Oh right...

872
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,523
Here, it's fixed.

873
01:06:27,029 --> 01:06:28,030
Thank you.

874
01:06:30,073 --> 01:06:32,366
Umm, you won't go anywhere, right?

875
01:06:32,659 --> 01:06:33,443
Huh...?

876
01:06:38,332 --> 01:06:41,544
The place I return to is with you...

877
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:49,679
<i>This is stupid...</i>

878
01:06:52,179 --> 01:06:55,391
<i>Just what... am I doing?</i>

879
01:07:08,570 --> 01:07:09,571
Naruto...

880
01:07:11,676 --> 01:07:12,677
Kakashi-sensei...

881
01:07:13,125 --> 01:07:15,169
What's the matter?
What's on your mind?

882
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:21,704
That guy!
The strategy meeting has begun.

883
01:07:22,302 --> 01:07:24,137
What's keeping him?!

884
01:07:24,586 --> 01:07:27,965
She's always upset when
it comes to Naruto...

885
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:29,000
Huh...?

886
01:07:29,258 --> 01:07:31,760
What's the matter?
Did you find Naruto?

887
01:07:35,222 --> 01:07:38,142
What do you plan on doing
with that kid?

888
01:07:38,726 --> 01:07:41,729
Why are you so worried about him?

889
01:07:42,855 --> 01:07:44,565
He's being used!

890
01:07:45,207 --> 01:07:48,293
He believes there's someone
he can return to...

891
01:07:48,944 --> 01:07:50,445
But he's sure to be betrayed.

892
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:56,822
When that happens...

893
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,575
He won't have anywhere to go.

894
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:04,538
If wherever someone thinks of you
is the place you return to...

895
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:08,167
Then... I'll keep thinking of him.

896
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:13,506
Then he wasn't talking about Sasuke...

897
01:08:15,549 --> 01:08:18,177
It may be important to think
about people.

898
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:21,138
But I wonder if things always
go that smoothly?

899
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:23,641
After all, everyone has
different thoughts and feelings.

900
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:26,977
That's not true.
Feelings always get through to others!

901
01:08:30,194 --> 01:08:31,081
Naruto...

902
01:08:35,032 --> 01:08:37,993
Let me go over Lady Tsunade's orders

903
01:08:38,016 --> 01:08:41,102
regarding strategy and a change
in team formation.

904
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:47,540
The search-and-aid mission
to Orochimaru's hideout is now over.

905
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:52,211
Sakura, Hinata and Ino...
you will be under my command.

906
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:53,170
- Yes.
- Yes.

907
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:53,969
Yes.

908
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:58,592
Kakashi will lead the rest.

909
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:04,140
Right. Our new mission is to seal
the Tailed Beast, the Three-Tails.

910
01:09:04,431 --> 01:09:07,893
And, to protect the child from the enemy.

911
01:09:07,898 --> 01:09:10,832
He seems to be connected in
some way to this Tailed Beast.

912
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:12,038
Huh?!

913
01:09:13,357 --> 01:09:15,693
It is not just the Akatsuki who
covet the Tailed Beast.

914
01:09:16,443 --> 01:09:19,446
If it becomes known that there is
a Tailed Beast that has no Jinchuriki,

915
01:09:19,826 --> 01:09:22,746
other nations are bound to join the hunt.

916
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:26,996
So that boy was brought here to turn him
into a Jinchuriki?

917
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,247
Right, Naruto?

918
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:30,249
- Huh?
- Sai!

919
01:09:31,255 --> 01:09:34,466
Huh? Oh right...
You're a Jinchuriki too, Naruto.

920
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:38,928
Humph!

921
01:09:39,388 --> 01:09:42,850
You always say things without thinking.

922
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:46,265
Still, you're right about what you said.

923
01:09:46,770 --> 01:09:49,648
Sealing the Three-Tails
and protecting that kid...

924
01:09:50,107 --> 01:09:55,321
That's so he doesn't end up
like Gaara and me, right, Shizune?

925
01:09:55,566 --> 01:09:57,151
Yes... that's right.

926
01:09:57,948 --> 01:09:59,992
Our goal is not to capture
the Tailed Beast.

927
01:10:00,242 --> 01:10:01,368
Even if we seal the Beast,

928
01:10:01,405 --> 01:10:04,158
we will make it disappear into
a space where no one else can touch it.

929
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:07,499
That is Lady Tsunade's...
the Hokage's will.

930
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,705
All right! Let's do it!

931
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:14,627
But... the Tailed Beast has
a huge mass of chakra, right?

932
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:16,962
I don't see how we can put a seal on it.

933
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:20,341
Yes. It will take an extremely
delicate amount

934
01:10:20,596 --> 01:10:23,966
of chakra control and concentration.

935
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:25,930
Sakura and Ino...

936
01:10:25,971 --> 01:10:27,723
Both of you are training
in medical ninjutsu.

937
01:10:28,270 --> 01:10:29,980
Your experience will be very useful.

938
01:10:30,355 --> 01:10:31,565
And Hinata...

939
01:10:32,149 --> 01:10:36,236
Umm, I have no experience
in medical ninjutsu.

940
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:39,777
What's important is your ability
to control chakra.

941
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:44,156
You may not know medical ninjutsu,
but your mastery of the Gentle Fist

942
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:47,618
and your Byakugan, which can
see the flow of chakra, will be useful.

943
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:49,203
You will be fine.

944
01:10:49,703 --> 01:10:51,497
Hinata, you're amazing!

945
01:10:51,705 --> 01:10:53,332
N-No I'm not...

946
01:11:00,547 --> 01:11:01,548
I understand.

947
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:11,100
I guess girls are better at
delicate chakra control. Yup, yup...

948
01:11:13,649 --> 01:11:15,692
Huh? But Tenten...

949
01:11:15,717 --> 01:11:17,552
How come she hasn't been chosen?

950
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:20,234
All the girls are on the Sealing team.

951
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:23,362
So I guess my chakra control is too clumsy!?

952
01:11:24,905 --> 01:11:28,200
I-I didn't mean it like that!

953
01:11:28,997 --> 01:11:32,000
The rest of you will work under Yamato
and I to provide protection.

954
01:11:32,584 --> 01:11:34,628
I'm sure you've already thought
about it...

955
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:38,978
But those guys who are after
the Three-Tails won't sit by and watch

956
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:40,549
while we finish sealing the beast.

957
01:11:40,884 --> 01:11:42,469
They are bound to attack.

958
01:11:43,136 --> 01:11:45,055
Those guys with the Crystal Style user!

959
01:11:45,575 --> 01:11:46,826
Bring them on!

960
01:11:47,411 --> 01:11:49,622
How will we team up for this?

961
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:52,374
Yeah, about that...

962
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:55,932
I have an idea.

963
01:11:58,151 --> 01:12:01,279
C'mon, don't hold back. Tell us!

964
01:12:01,903 --> 01:12:05,907
The most critical part of this battle
is to stop the Crystal Style user.

965
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:10,701
However, if we all confront her,
the Sealing team won't have protection...

966
01:12:11,368 --> 01:12:14,163
So I'm thinking of splitting up
this team into two,

967
01:12:14,204 --> 01:12:16,123
with one team focusing on her.

968
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:18,672
Naruto, Sai, Shino!

969
01:12:19,089 --> 01:12:20,257
- Right!
- Gotcha!

970
01:12:22,129 --> 01:12:26,342
You three will work under me
to fight the Crystal Style user!

971
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,015
As for the rest...

972
01:12:28,766 --> 01:12:30,768
Yamato, you guys take care of them.

973
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:32,306
Understood...

974
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:35,898
Okay, those of you who
weren't called, gather 'round!

975
01:12:36,565 --> 01:12:38,692
He makes it sound like
we're the rejects...

976
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:39,701
Now, now...

977
01:12:40,194 --> 01:12:42,363
Let's go for it with
the eagerness of youth!

978
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:43,776
Yeah...

979
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:53,285
What were you doing?

980
01:12:55,245 --> 01:12:56,580
Isn't it obvious?

981
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:01,043
I was reporting to Kabuto...
about the movements of the Leaf.

982
01:13:01,507 --> 01:13:06,804
And... Kabuto said he was going back
to see Lord Orochimaru immediately.

983
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:09,218
At a time like this...?

984
01:13:09,593 --> 01:13:12,471
Well, I guess he has lots of things
on his mind.

985
01:13:13,644 --> 01:13:14,645
I see...

986
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:17,101
Rinji...

987
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:18,519
Huh?

988
01:13:18,690 --> 01:13:21,693
About earlier, I believe you...

989
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,235
Huh?

990
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:33,951
<i>Preventing the sealing
of the Three-Tails,</i>

991
01:13:33,992 --> 01:13:35,702
<i>and the destruction of the Hidden Leaf.</i>

992
01:13:35,869 --> 01:13:37,871
<i>Things are about to get busy...</i>

993
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:44,002
<i>The Hidden Leaf are here.</i>

994
01:13:45,425 --> 01:13:49,846
<i>First, we have to destroy them.
Capturing Three-Tails comes after that.</i>

995
01:13:54,138 --> 01:13:56,515
<i>Hah! Who cares?</i>

996
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:59,268
<i>Lord Orochimaru has
high hopes for me.</i>

997
01:13:59,481 --> 01:14:03,568
<i>My wish... my wish is to be
with Lord Orochimaru.</i>

998
01:14:04,342 --> 01:14:08,513
<i>And this guy Orochimaru will do
anything to achieve his ambitions.</i>

999
01:14:08,657 --> 01:14:11,994
<i>He's a bastard who thinks nothing
of taking peoples' lives!</i>

1000
01:14:12,452 --> 01:14:16,331
<i>Anyone who serves a guy like
that can't be a decent human being!</i>

1001
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:19,329
<i>Damn! What's wrong with me...?</i>

1002
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:22,749
What are you doing in a place like this?
Thinking up a strategy?

1003
01:14:23,422 --> 01:14:25,674
<i>This guy...
When did he show up?</i>

1004
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:27,296
Sort of...

1005
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:29,131
<i>How long has he been here?</i>

1006
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:34,470
Oh... the mist is clearing.

1007
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:51,320
Yes, it's time to move!

1008
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:58,327
All of you, have you memorized
the plan of action?

1009
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:05,834
If that child is discovered during
our operation, protect him.

1010
01:15:08,425 --> 01:15:12,803
All right, let's begin.
Tenten, please show it to us.

1011
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:13,981
Yes.

1012
01:15:15,802 --> 01:15:18,597
This is the giant scroll that was
specially prepared by Lady Tsunade

1013
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:20,807
for the sealing of the Three-Tails!

1014
01:15:21,271 --> 01:15:22,401
Here! Naruto!

1015
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:29,274
Huh?! We're going to use
this massive scroll?

1016
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:34,321
Yes. We have to suppress
a huge amount of chakra.

1017
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:38,742
Kakashi, we're counting on you.

1018
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:40,536
You got it!

1019
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:43,997
Guard Team 2, in your positions!

1020
01:15:44,753 --> 01:15:45,796
- Right!
- Right!

1021
01:15:46,319 --> 01:15:50,072
Naruto! We go our separate ways now.
Good luck.

1022
01:15:50,754 --> 01:15:51,755
Yeah!

1023
01:15:52,673 --> 01:15:53,799
Leave it to me!

1024
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:08,313
All right, let's begin.

1025
01:16:08,855 --> 01:16:09,982
Everyone, in your positions!

1026
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:12,568
Let's go!

1027
01:16:14,945 --> 01:16:17,155
Well, we'll get started too!

1028
01:16:30,210 --> 01:16:32,588
Why do you look so depressed?

1029
01:16:32,629 --> 01:16:33,630
Huh?

1030
01:16:33,802 --> 01:16:35,428
I'm not depressed...

1031
01:16:35,799 --> 01:16:37,884
Just disappointed that
I'm not on the team

1032
01:16:37,890 --> 01:16:41,644
that's going to battle
this amazing Crystal Style user.

1033
01:16:41,972 --> 01:16:45,100
Hey, hey... We're Chunin now.

1034
01:16:45,517 --> 01:16:48,061
I understand you wanting
to fight someone strong,

1035
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:49,896
but this isn't the time to be selfish.

1036
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:55,944
And besides,
her henchmen are ridiculously strong too.

1037
01:16:56,033 --> 01:16:57,201
Really?

1038
01:16:57,487 --> 01:16:59,823
Please tell me all the details!

1039
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:01,033
Y-Yeah sure.

1040
01:17:01,325 --> 01:17:03,577
They were a ton of trouble...

1041
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:05,287
Can I listen in?

1042
01:17:05,537 --> 01:17:09,958
Sure... Anyway, they lay a smoke screen,
which is a real pain.

1043
01:17:10,083 --> 01:17:11,084
A smoke screen?

1044
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:12,711
Is it toxic? Or...

1045
01:17:12,753 --> 01:17:14,379
Just listen until the end.

1046
01:17:14,421 --> 01:17:16,131
Then will you just get on with it?

1047
01:17:25,229 --> 01:17:28,315
Oh, right.
You two have never met before.

1048
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:31,229
Sharp of you to notice, Naruto.

1049
01:17:31,777 --> 01:17:33,695
This here is Sai.

1050
01:17:35,233 --> 01:17:38,945
He came from the ANBU Black Ops
and he's sorta gloomy and depressing...

1051
01:17:39,243 --> 01:17:40,995
like he's missing something...

1052
01:17:41,531 --> 01:17:43,408
Just a weird guy who's
constantly reading books.

1053
01:17:43,867 --> 01:17:44,743
Naruto...

1054
01:17:44,743 --> 01:17:46,286
But he draws great!

1055
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:48,997
And he's pretty strong!

1056
01:17:50,712 --> 01:17:52,130
And this guy is Shino.

1057
01:17:52,506 --> 01:17:54,341
Umm... Shino is...

1058
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:57,005
well, Shino.

1059
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:01,014
You're Shino Aburame.

1060
01:18:02,641 --> 01:18:04,518
You're the son of Shibi Aburame.

1061
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:06,807
You have participated in
numerous missions

1062
01:18:06,807 --> 01:18:09,768
relying on your skill in combat,
as a bodyguard, and in search and seizure.

1063
01:18:09,898 --> 01:18:14,235
You're a specialist in the Secret Jutsu
of manipulating Parasitic Insects.

1064
01:18:15,070 --> 01:18:15,840
Right?

1065
01:18:16,238 --> 01:18:19,908
Hey, Sai. How come you know so much?

1066
01:18:20,158 --> 01:18:24,037
You've done your research.
But I guess that goes without saying.

1067
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:27,833
After all, you're a former
ANBU Black Ops member.

1068
01:18:29,751 --> 01:18:34,046
Well, now that you know each other,
we can be a team.

1069
01:18:35,132 --> 01:18:35,888
Naruto.

1070
01:18:36,508 --> 01:18:39,678
My favorite foods are wild grass salad
and winter melon.

1071
01:18:39,887 --> 01:18:40,554
Huh?

1072
01:18:40,574 --> 01:18:43,452
I don't like...
foods that have a strong odor.

1073
01:18:43,724 --> 01:18:44,725
I see.

1074
01:18:45,595 --> 01:18:46,847
So what of it?

1075
01:18:48,598 --> 01:18:52,686
Since we're on the same team,
we should know about each other.

1076
01:18:53,311 --> 01:18:55,313
It affects our teamwork.

1077
01:18:55,689 --> 01:18:56,690
Shino...

1078
01:18:57,524 --> 01:19:00,944
It really doesn't matter
what kind of foods you like.

1079
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:03,947
Wh-What?

1080
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:11,079
Naruto... You really need to
know more about me.

1081
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:13,874
Because it would be strange

1082
01:19:13,915 --> 01:19:18,003
if a newcomer knows more
about me than an old friend.

1083
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:25,677
I guess I'm just not on
the same wavelength as you guys.

1084
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:38,482
Gozu...

1085
01:19:39,149 --> 01:19:39,863
Yes?

1086
01:19:39,883 --> 01:19:41,343
What do you think about Kabuto?

1087
01:19:42,241 --> 01:19:44,535
I just don't like the guy...

1088
01:19:48,825 --> 01:19:49,951
Well, forget it.

1089
01:19:51,375 --> 01:19:54,712
After I get rid of the Leaf,
I can grab his ponytail and...

1090
01:19:58,752 --> 01:20:01,880
<i>Yuukimaru is simply a tool
to control the Three-Tails.</i>

1091
01:20:03,428 --> 01:20:06,639
Why the hell am I feeling
so irritated! Damn it!

1092
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:11,306
Let's go!

1093
01:20:13,522 --> 01:20:17,443
I will accompany you,
no matter where you go...

1094
01:20:36,253 --> 01:20:37,671
It's all clear.

1095
01:20:44,970 --> 01:20:46,847
Damn! I'm soaking wet!

1096
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:49,970
You're lucky you don't get wet, Nurari!

1097
01:20:51,221 --> 01:20:53,640
What is that? Your pet?

1098
01:20:54,182 --> 01:20:55,183
Good work.

1099
01:20:57,649 --> 01:21:01,278
All right... Shall we go
with the usual strategy?

1100
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:04,693
Bro...?

1101
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:09,389
Huh?

1102
01:21:09,930 --> 01:21:12,349
Yeah... Let's do it the usual way.

1103
01:21:22,841 --> 01:21:26,303
We will proceed with
the Four-Corner Sealing Barrier.

1104
01:21:26,845 --> 01:21:30,849
First, we'll locate the Three-Tails
and then move on to the Sealing jutsu.

1105
01:21:31,475 --> 01:21:34,353
I've already shown you
the hand signs. Ready?

1106
01:21:39,066 --> 01:21:41,318
<i>Four-Corner Sealing Barrier... Search!</i>

1107
01:21:54,039 --> 01:21:57,543
All right, let's go right
into the jutsu.

1108
01:22:14,476 --> 01:22:16,020
This should do for now.

1109
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:20,477
We'll maintain this chakra balance,
and slowly enlarge the opening.

1110
01:22:20,977 --> 01:22:22,771
If the Three-Tails is
below the barrier,

1111
01:22:22,812 --> 01:22:24,481
we'll get a reaction.

1112
01:22:24,945 --> 01:22:25,612
Ready?

1113
01:22:25,926 --> 01:22:27,094
Please wait a minute!

1114
01:22:27,573 --> 01:22:30,409
If we continue with
such delicate chakra control...

1115
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:31,780
and the enemy appears...

1116
01:22:31,821 --> 01:22:33,406
We won't be able to oppose them.

1117
01:22:33,573 --> 01:22:34,950
We won't have to fight back.

1118
01:22:35,622 --> 01:22:36,370
Huh?!

1119
01:22:36,665 --> 01:22:39,960
You just concentrate on
your chakra control.

1120
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:42,916
And believe that your comrades
will take care of the enemy.

1121
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:45,251
I understand.

1122
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:51,341
- Ino!
- Oh!

1123
01:22:51,925 --> 01:22:52,926
Are you all right?!

1124
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:57,722
<i>How can I stay alert for the enemy?</i>

1125
01:22:58,348 --> 01:23:01,142
<i>I don't even know if I can maintain
this level of chakra control...</i>

1126
01:23:01,309 --> 01:23:02,519
You'll be fine, Ino.

1127
01:23:03,937 --> 01:23:05,063
I know you can do this...

1128
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:06,481
Sakura...

1129
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:10,402
Chakra control is basic to us, right?

1130
01:23:17,956 --> 01:23:19,624
<i>You'll be fine, Ino!</i>

1131
01:23:20,209 --> 01:23:21,711
<i>You can do it, I'm telling you!</i>

1132
01:23:22,294 --> 01:23:25,505
<i>Chakra control is the foundation
of medical ninjutsu.</i>

1133
01:23:25,964 --> 01:23:26,965
<i>Now, let's try again.</i>

1134
01:23:30,052 --> 01:23:31,846
<i>Get a fix on the opening!</i>

1135
01:23:32,179 --> 01:23:34,765
<i>Gently... Keep it very fine...</i>

1136
01:23:36,433 --> 01:23:38,768
<i>You've persevered too...</i>

1137
01:23:40,771 --> 01:23:42,940
Hah, don't belittle me!

1138
01:23:43,649 --> 01:23:45,067
Of course, I...

1139
01:23:46,527 --> 01:23:47,862
can do this!

1140
01:23:55,994 --> 01:23:58,246
You got it? What do you-?

1141
01:23:58,324 --> 01:24:00,493
The strategy to capture
the enemy, of course!

1142
01:24:00,744 --> 01:24:02,328
Like I told you earlier...

1143
01:24:02,662 --> 01:24:05,123
In that smoke screen,
visibility is almost zero...

1144
01:24:05,999 --> 01:24:08,668
And as much as I hate to admit it,
even Akamaru's nose is useless...

1145
01:24:08,924 --> 01:24:14,346
Yet the enemy knows our position
and keeps attacking...

1146
01:24:15,341 --> 01:24:19,971
Basically, we should avoid fighting
inside the smoke screen, but...

1147
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:21,181
No!

1148
01:24:21,306 --> 01:24:24,225
That's just running away
from the enemy,

1149
01:24:24,356 --> 01:24:26,358
and will only make it harder
to defeat them.

1150
01:24:26,394 --> 01:24:28,229
That's why I said they're a nuisance--

1151
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:30,982
And I'm saying I figured out a way!

1152
01:24:31,107 --> 01:24:35,361
Lee, you've really started using
your head since becoming a Chunin.

1153
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:37,489
You aren't just a training freak.

1154
01:24:37,822 --> 01:24:41,493
Good job...
Well then, why don't you tell us your plan?

1155
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:44,454
All right, the strategy is...

1156
01:24:45,205 --> 01:24:46,998
- The strategy is...?
- The strategy is...?

1157
01:24:48,124 --> 01:24:49,667
The strategy is...

1158
01:24:50,543 --> 01:24:51,544
Is...?

1159
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:53,088
It's...

1160
01:24:57,175 --> 01:25:01,554
Guts! If we have the guts,
there's no enemy we can't beat!

1161
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:04,724
Huh?
What's the matter, everyone?

1162
01:25:05,786 --> 01:25:08,747
Why you--!
Keeping us in suspense!

1163
01:25:08,775 --> 01:25:09,634
And that's all you have?

1164
01:25:09,651 --> 01:25:11,466
- Quit fooling around!
- Wh-What?

1165
01:25:11,564 --> 01:25:13,525
What did I do?!

1166
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:16,861
I take it back.
He's just a workout addict, after all.

1167
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:27,997
All right! Let's go!

1168
01:25:28,164 --> 01:25:29,165
Right...

1169
01:25:29,922 --> 01:25:31,299
Shino, how's it going over there?

1170
01:25:32,925 --> 01:25:34,719
I need a little more time...

1171
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:36,261
All right...

1172
01:25:36,464 --> 01:25:38,883
Sai. Basically, we'll keep
the same formation...

1173
01:25:38,925 --> 01:25:41,636
that Yamato used when he was captain.

1174
01:25:41,934 --> 01:25:43,144
Yes... Senpai.

1175
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:45,056
Huh? Oh right.

1176
01:25:45,437 --> 01:25:47,022
You also came from there.

1177
01:25:47,285 --> 01:25:49,079
Huh? There?

1178
01:25:50,103 --> 01:25:51,104
ANBU Black Ops.

1179
01:25:51,521 --> 01:25:53,731
The way they fight,

1180
01:25:53,731 --> 01:25:56,484
Their code doesn't include
protecting comrades.

1181
01:25:57,443 --> 01:26:00,905
But this time, we're fighting to protect
our comrades at all cost.

1182
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:03,121
I want you to keep that in mind...

1183
01:26:03,146 --> 01:26:04,147
Don't worry.

1184
01:26:05,624 --> 01:26:07,167
Having faith in my comrades...

1185
01:26:07,837 --> 01:26:10,589
I'm here because
that's something I believe in now.

1186
01:26:12,172 --> 01:26:15,008
Hey, you're beginning to understand...

1187
01:26:17,761 --> 01:26:20,046
<i>The place where someone
thinks of you,</i>

1188
01:26:20,055 --> 01:26:22,766
<i>that's the place you go back to...</i>

1189
01:26:23,809 --> 01:26:26,770
<i>That's right.
There are friends thinking of you.</i>

1190
01:26:26,973 --> 01:26:28,600
<i>That's why you can return to them...</i>

1191
01:26:29,142 --> 01:26:31,936
<i>Friends who have faith in you...</i>

1192
01:26:33,151 --> 01:26:35,945
<i>I finally found the place...
where I can go back to.</i>

1193
01:26:36,357 --> 01:26:37,567
<i>Right, Guren?</i>

1194
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:44,574
<i>He still doesn't understand the true
meaning of thinking about someone.</i>

1195
01:26:44,696 --> 01:26:46,030
<i>She's deceiving him...</i>

1196
01:26:46,039 --> 01:26:47,040
They're coming!

1197
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:53,917
Anyway, I need to keep
my distance from Shino...

1198
01:27:11,148 --> 01:27:13,109
You won't get away this time.

1199
01:27:14,735 --> 01:27:15,986
Why you--!

1200
01:27:17,487 --> 01:27:21,450
<i>I finally found the place
where I can go back to.</i>

1201
01:27:21,986 --> 01:27:24,739
You've deceived Yuukimaru into
believing you're a friend!

1202
01:27:25,949 --> 01:27:27,116
Shut up!

1203
01:27:30,828 --> 01:27:31,829
Too easy!

1204
01:27:33,498 --> 01:27:34,499
Naruto!

1205
01:27:41,506 --> 01:27:42,507
It's begun...

1206
01:27:42,924 --> 01:27:43,925
Here they come!

1207
01:27:50,515 --> 01:27:53,059
Captain Yamato!
It's the smoke-screen guy!

1208
01:27:53,434 --> 01:27:55,144
<i>So he's the vanguard...</i>

1209
01:27:55,311 --> 01:27:56,312
<i>Well then...!</i>

1210
01:28:02,193 --> 01:28:03,987
Nice, Captain Yamato!

1211
01:28:04,654 --> 01:28:05,697
Wait, Lee!

1212
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:08,950
<i>Leaf... Whirlwind!</i>

1213
01:28:12,167 --> 01:28:13,050
What?

1214
01:28:17,339 --> 01:28:19,758
Eat this!
<i>Vanishing Smoke Prison!</i>

1215
01:28:20,628 --> 01:28:22,422
- This is bad...
- I told you!

1216
01:28:22,463 --> 01:28:23,923
I'm going to back up Lee!

1217
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:26,426
No! You may end up
attacking each other...

1218
01:28:31,556 --> 01:28:34,058
This is the smoke screen
Kiba talked about...

1219
01:28:34,183 --> 01:28:38,313
He was right.
I can't see in front of me. Then...

1220
01:28:46,863 --> 01:28:51,326
Rinji, we're ready anytime.
How's his position?

1221
01:28:52,457 --> 01:28:53,458
Rinji?

1222
01:28:53,661 --> 01:28:55,747
There's something I must do...

1223
01:28:55,788 --> 01:28:57,623
Huh? Hey, Rinji?

1224
01:29:00,668 --> 01:29:03,296
<i>I can't sense anyone's presence...</i>

1225
01:29:03,629 --> 01:29:07,383
<i>How far does the smoke spread?
Is everyone else caught up in it?</i>

1226
01:29:08,807 --> 01:29:09,850
<i>What should I do?</i>

1227
01:29:10,809 --> 01:29:11,810
<i>Lee...</i>

1228
01:29:12,603 --> 01:29:17,983
<i>A ninja never gives up,
even if all his senses are shut down.</i>

1229
01:29:18,108 --> 01:29:19,526
<i>Yes, Guy-sensei...</i>

1230
01:29:19,729 --> 01:29:24,025
<i>If you recall your days of harsh training,
this is nothing.</i>

1231
01:29:24,233 --> 01:29:27,362
<i>We have something stronger than
the five senses, the vision of the heart.</i>

1232
01:29:28,202 --> 01:29:29,370
<i>The vision of the heart...</i>

1233
01:29:29,395 --> 01:29:30,146
<i>Right!</i>

1234
01:29:30,245 --> 01:29:32,789
<i>Seize the enemy with
your Spirit sensor</i>

1235
01:29:32,873 --> 01:29:35,375
<i>which you developed through
unceasing diligence and determination!</i>

1236
01:29:35,453 --> 01:29:36,788
<i>Spirit sensor!</i>

1237
01:29:36,913 --> 01:29:39,832
<i>Wise words, Guy-sensei!</i>

1238
01:29:39,874 --> 01:29:42,097
<i>All right! Spirit sensor... On!</i>

1239
01:29:43,878 --> 01:29:47,382
<i>Rinji! How can you change
the strategy now?!</i>

1240
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:50,051
<i>I've got something through
my Spirit sensor!</i>

1241
01:29:50,218 --> 01:29:52,678
Without Rinji's power,
this strategy won't...

1242
01:29:56,271 --> 01:29:57,856
What? What is that?

1243
01:29:57,981 --> 01:29:59,816
What happened, Kihou?! Hey!

1244
01:30:02,236 --> 01:30:04,112
Damn... Where the hell is he...?

1245
01:30:10,577 --> 01:30:11,704
<i>Shadow Dance!</i>

1246
01:30:11,745 --> 01:30:13,621
<i>Severe Leaf Hurricane!</i>

1247
01:30:13,664 --> 01:30:14,665
He did it!

1248
01:30:14,826 --> 01:30:15,993
It's over!

1249
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:24,508
That guy! Making us worry.

1250
01:30:27,761 --> 01:30:28,845
That means...

1251
01:30:29,215 --> 01:30:32,593
Only the enemy is in
that smoke screen now.

1252
01:30:36,728 --> 01:30:37,979
<i>Rising Dragon Control!</i>

1253
01:30:46,357 --> 01:30:48,192
What's going on?!

1254
01:30:52,536 --> 01:30:55,789
Damn it!
Our positions are totally reversed!

1255
01:30:56,206 --> 01:30:58,708
Just get rid of
this damned smoke screen!

1256
01:30:59,787 --> 01:31:01,581
It's not over yet...

1257
01:31:03,255 --> 01:31:05,424
Right now,
it's worse if we can't see.

1258
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:19,223
Wh-What's happening?
Were these guys this weak?

1259
01:31:20,725 --> 01:31:22,643
They're not much, these guys.

1260
01:31:22,691 --> 01:31:25,152
I expected more of a fight.

1261
01:31:26,731 --> 01:31:30,067
<i>At this rate,
I'm going to look like a useless ninja.</i>

1262
01:31:30,824 --> 01:31:35,204
<i>And besides, her henchmen
are ridiculously strong too.</i>

1263
01:31:35,954 --> 01:31:38,374
We can't stay like this, Akamaru...

1264
01:31:43,587 --> 01:31:45,297
- Th-This is bad!
- Let's run!

1265
01:31:45,589 --> 01:31:46,590
Akamaru!

1266
01:31:47,883 --> 01:31:49,593
<i>Dynamic Marking!</i>

1267
01:31:50,511 --> 01:31:52,555
Wh-What is this?! It stinks!

1268
01:31:52,679 --> 01:31:55,682
I can erase the smell!
<i>Vanishing Smoke Prison!</i>

1269
01:31:56,058 --> 01:31:57,226
Everyone, retreat!

1270
01:32:03,434 --> 01:32:05,561
How did you know our position?!

1271
01:32:05,567 --> 01:32:08,570
Akamaru's Dynamic Marking is special.

1272
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:11,338
Even your gas cannot eliminate the scent.

1273
01:32:12,699 --> 01:32:14,868
You guys made a fool out of me...

1274
01:32:15,244 --> 01:32:16,245
Eat this!

1275
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:21,869
<i>Fang Over Fang!</i>

1276
01:32:29,758 --> 01:32:30,717
You did it!

1277
01:32:30,742 --> 01:32:32,076
- We did it!
- Oh well...

1278
01:32:32,594 --> 01:32:34,429
I guess there was no role for me to play.

1279
01:32:35,681 --> 01:32:39,185
<i>I was a diversion so that
he couldn't accumulate fighting power...</i>

1280
01:32:39,637 --> 01:32:41,642
<i>Kakashi-senpai read
the situation perfectly.</i>

1281
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:45,911
<i>But this Crystal Style Counter team...</i>

1282
01:32:56,204 --> 01:32:56,955
They're coming!

1283
01:32:57,154 --> 01:32:58,864
<i>Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

1284
01:33:03,753 --> 01:33:05,546
Stay out of this, small fry!

1285
01:33:11,865 --> 01:33:12,866
Kakashi-sensei!

1286
01:33:13,523 --> 01:33:16,485
Come at me with all your might!
Sharingan Kakashi!

1287
01:33:16,637 --> 01:33:19,724
Unfortunately,
I'm not the hot-blooded type.

1288
01:33:27,779 --> 01:33:29,906
Where'd you hide Yuukimaru?!

1289
01:33:30,506 --> 01:33:32,383
That's none of your business!

1290
01:33:32,824 --> 01:33:35,994
It's my fault that he went over
to you guys!

1291
01:33:36,381 --> 01:33:39,760
I won't let you use him
like some kind of tool!

1292
01:33:40,302 --> 01:33:43,222
I'm going to beat you
and rescue Yuukimaru!

1293
01:33:43,263 --> 01:33:44,264
Shut up!

1294
01:33:44,875 --> 01:33:47,795
As if... you understand!

1295
01:33:50,589 --> 01:33:51,924
Damn! Damn it!

1296
01:33:54,983 --> 01:33:55,984
<i>Not yet?</i>

1297
01:33:59,530 --> 01:34:04,201
<i>These guys require more chakra
than the usual Parasitic Insects.</i>

1298
01:34:05,285 --> 01:34:06,286
<i>And that's...</i>

1299
01:34:06,995 --> 01:34:09,915
<i>in order to bring down
the Crystal Style user!</i>

1300
01:34:25,165 --> 01:34:26,625
The small fry can stay out of this!

1301
01:34:29,101 --> 01:34:32,062
All right! Come at me, Kakashi!

1302
01:34:44,241 --> 01:34:46,410
<i>So this is the power
she kept hidden...</i>

1303
01:35:00,284 --> 01:35:02,077
So persistent...

1304
01:35:02,703 --> 01:35:05,914
So you just run away when
your ink drawings don't work?

1305
01:35:06,158 --> 01:35:08,327
Is that your ninja art?

1306
01:35:09,126 --> 01:35:11,962
There are other uses for my ink.

1307
01:35:12,129 --> 01:35:13,130
What...?

1308
01:35:30,412 --> 01:35:32,456
<i>Ninja Art: Ink Flush.</i>

1309
01:35:34,583 --> 01:35:36,043
What's the matter?

1310
01:35:36,085 --> 01:35:37,711
Come at me!

1311
01:35:38,754 --> 01:35:40,172
<i>I'm fed up...</i>

1312
01:35:40,199 --> 01:35:44,703
<i>When we last fought,
she didn't release all her power?</i>

1313
01:35:46,205 --> 01:35:47,790
The next one's for real!

1314
01:35:49,291 --> 01:35:51,001
<i>Crystal Style:
Burst Crystal Falling Dragon!</i>

1315
01:35:51,168 --> 01:35:51,835
Wha--?!

1316
01:35:52,083 --> 01:35:53,084
Die!

1317
01:35:57,857 --> 01:36:00,818
<i>She can turn anything
she touches into crystal.</i>

1318
01:36:01,151 --> 01:36:04,655
<i>In other words, Water, Earth
nor Wood Styles have any effect.</i>

1319
01:36:05,891 --> 01:36:08,643
<i>However... this will...!</i>

1320
01:36:16,125 --> 01:36:17,084
<i>Did I do it...?</i>

1321
01:36:17,835 --> 01:36:18,836
So naïve...

1322
01:36:38,939 --> 01:36:40,900
Too bad, Kakashi.

1323
01:36:42,344 --> 01:36:45,973
<i>The three-tailed dragon was
just a diversion to keep me here...</i>

1324
01:36:46,306 --> 01:36:50,769
For all the rumors,
your Sharingan isn't that impressive.

1325
01:36:51,395 --> 01:36:53,439
Well now, playtime is over.

1326
01:37:02,421 --> 01:37:03,422
It's useless.

1327
01:37:25,819 --> 01:37:27,154
H-Hey!

1328
01:37:27,655 --> 01:37:30,741
Ino... focus on the chakra
for the barrier!

1329
01:37:31,116 --> 01:37:31,909
R-Right!

1330
01:37:32,519 --> 01:37:35,688
<i>The Hidden Leaf...
are looking for Three-Tails?</i>

1331
01:37:37,399 --> 01:37:40,318
Okay, let's settle this!

1332
01:37:43,906 --> 01:37:45,241
Kakashi-sensei...!

1333
01:37:46,617 --> 01:37:47,910
Prepare to die...!

1334
01:37:55,125 --> 01:37:56,126
What?!

1335
01:38:12,866 --> 01:38:14,243
Oh! Shino!

1336
01:38:14,910 --> 01:38:17,913
Just in the nick of time.
Are they ready?

1337
01:38:18,455 --> 01:38:20,966
If they weren't, I wouldn't have come.

1338
01:38:21,291 --> 01:38:25,212
Humph... If it isn't the Insect user.

1339
01:38:25,489 --> 01:38:28,451
Your jutsu is useless against me.

1340
01:38:33,721 --> 01:38:35,180
It's useless!

1341
01:38:45,843 --> 01:38:48,763
Didn't I tell you? It's useless.

1342
01:38:49,669 --> 01:38:50,920
I wonder about that...

1343
01:38:51,363 --> 01:38:52,364
What?!

1344
01:39:05,153 --> 01:39:06,154
It can't be!

1345
01:39:07,406 --> 01:39:09,992
Your jutsu won't work against me.

1346
01:39:10,632 --> 01:39:14,219
That is because my insects
are capable of infinite evolution.

1347
01:39:15,179 --> 01:39:17,598
They are now resistant to your jutsu.

1348
01:39:18,307 --> 01:39:20,642
Yes, you did it! That's amazing!

1349
01:39:23,547 --> 01:39:27,676
That's impossible...
My Crystal Style can't be defeated...

1350
01:39:27,983 --> 01:39:29,860
<i>Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

1351
01:39:38,786 --> 01:39:41,121
I won't let you get away now!

1352
01:39:43,332 --> 01:39:44,458
Stay still!

1353
01:39:50,741 --> 01:39:52,284
Where is Yuukimaru?!

1354
01:39:53,759 --> 01:39:54,885
Why do you...?!

1355
01:39:56,747 --> 01:40:00,125
You want that boy's power too?

1356
01:40:00,459 --> 01:40:02,127
I don't need anything like that!

1357
01:40:02,351 --> 01:40:03,560
I wonder about that...

1358
01:40:07,981 --> 01:40:10,651
Now...! Her Crystal Style
has been sealed!

1359
01:40:16,156 --> 01:40:17,699
Tell us!

1360
01:40:18,283 --> 01:40:19,993
Where is Yuukimaru?!

1361
01:40:34,758 --> 01:40:36,051
Why you--!

1362
01:40:42,042 --> 01:40:43,043
This is...!

1363
01:40:46,088 --> 01:40:47,089
Guren...

1364
01:40:59,908 --> 01:41:01,285
This is... mud?

1365
01:41:18,954 --> 01:41:22,407
It seems that Crystal
mends itself right away.

1366
01:41:22,958 --> 01:41:25,502
Damn it! There's no end to this!

1367
01:41:26,003 --> 01:41:28,213
Focus the Insects' attack on one spot.

1368
01:41:41,310 --> 01:41:42,311
Guren...

1369
01:41:49,443 --> 01:41:50,527
<i>I can't keep up...!</i>

1370
01:41:52,946 --> 01:41:53,947
<i>Lightning Blade!</i>

1371
01:41:59,453 --> 01:42:00,454
<i>A mud wall?!</i>

1372
01:42:01,121 --> 01:42:02,122
<i>Gozu?!</i>

1373
01:42:13,717 --> 01:42:15,510
Gozu, you...

1374
01:42:17,387 --> 01:42:18,388
What are you doing?!

1375
01:42:18,995 --> 01:42:21,706
Let go! I'm going to kill them...!

1376
01:42:26,438 --> 01:42:27,439
Gozu...?

1377
01:42:35,989 --> 01:42:37,824
I won't let you through!

1378
01:42:42,913 --> 01:42:45,666
Guren!

1379
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:08,146
Are you all right, Kakashi-sensei?!

1380
01:43:08,525 --> 01:43:10,068
Yeah... But...

1381
01:43:10,476 --> 01:43:11,686
Guren got away.

1382
01:43:13,287 --> 01:43:15,956
She was the key to finding Yuukimaru...!

1383
01:43:19,113 --> 01:43:20,114
It's regrettable...

1384
01:43:20,858 --> 01:43:25,613
My insects performed flawlessly,
yet she got away...

1385
01:43:27,708 --> 01:43:29,585
All right, we'll split up and search!

1386
01:43:30,210 --> 01:43:32,712
Naruto, you go with Shino.
Sai, come with me!

1387
01:43:40,179 --> 01:43:42,681
You said that they were formidable,

1388
01:43:42,925 --> 01:43:44,760
so I was burning with
the desire to fight...

1389
01:43:44,864 --> 01:43:47,241
What was that?
They were so easy to beat.

1390
01:43:47,355 --> 01:43:50,817
Yup... They were so different
from the last time.

1391
01:43:51,014 --> 01:43:53,809
Are you sure about these next guys?

1392
01:43:55,033 --> 01:43:56,409
Don't let your guard down.

1393
01:43:56,445 --> 01:43:57,446
Y-Yes!

1394
01:43:58,530 --> 01:44:00,407
Kakashi-senpai had
his hands full with her.

1395
01:44:00,885 --> 01:44:02,553
The Crystal Style user is no joke!

1396
01:44:02,968 --> 01:44:04,762
I'd love to face her in battle...

1397
01:44:04,787 --> 01:44:06,826
to see if my taijutsu is effective
against her!

1398
01:44:09,458 --> 01:44:11,043
Let's split up into two groups here.

1399
01:44:11,510 --> 01:44:14,221
Lee and Tenten will guard
the Sealing team by the lake!

1400
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:17,966
And we will reinforce with Senpai's team
against the Crystal Style user!

1401
01:44:18,075 --> 01:44:19,076
Right!

1402
01:44:19,451 --> 01:44:22,537
Huh? I won't be able to fight
the Crystal Style user?

1403
01:44:22,888 --> 01:44:25,223
We don't know where
the enemy may appear.

1404
01:44:25,339 --> 01:44:27,383
I just told you not to
let your guard down...!

1405
01:44:27,506 --> 01:44:28,841
- Y-Yes!
- Yes!

1406
01:44:32,314 --> 01:44:33,649
Huh?! Just now...!

1407
01:44:35,192 --> 01:44:37,111
I know... It's close...

1408
01:44:38,236 --> 01:44:39,487
Directly below us...

1409
01:44:40,489 --> 01:44:41,658
It's finally come...

1410
01:44:45,953 --> 01:44:49,040
We are switching from the "search" mode
of the Four-Corner Sealing Barrier.

1411
01:44:49,428 --> 01:44:50,888
Keep your breathing soft and steady.

1412
01:44:51,333 --> 01:44:52,293
Here we go!

1413
01:44:52,420 --> 01:44:54,693
- <i>Four-Corner Sealing Barrier: Bind!</i>
- <i>Four-Corner Sealing Barrier: Bind!</i>

1414
01:45:02,177 --> 01:45:06,682
We'll quietly sink the net.
Do not let the Three-Tails detect us!

1415
01:45:08,364 --> 01:45:09,365
The enemy...!

1416
01:45:09,852 --> 01:45:10,853
Concentrate!

1417
01:45:11,075 --> 01:45:11,754
But!

1418
01:45:13,021 --> 01:45:14,647
<i>Leaf Hurricane!</i>

1419
01:45:15,482 --> 01:45:16,483
<i>What?!</i>

1420
01:45:19,486 --> 01:45:21,071
Lee! Tenten!

1421
01:45:21,460 --> 01:45:23,045
We've taken care of
the enemy on that side,

1422
01:45:23,045 --> 01:45:24,672
so we rushed over.

1423
01:45:25,089 --> 01:45:26,382
I'm glad we made it in time!

1424
01:45:26,869 --> 01:45:28,078
Now that I'm here,

1425
01:45:28,161 --> 01:45:30,663
I won't allow you to lay
a finger on these four!

1426
01:45:31,039 --> 01:45:33,250
There should've been others to stop you...

1427
01:45:33,458 --> 01:45:37,337
Oh, them...
They were no match for us.

1428
01:45:37,671 --> 01:45:39,965
Damn... So Kigiri and
the others were beaten...

1429
01:45:42,634 --> 01:45:44,385
Now then, I am your opponent!

1430
01:45:47,903 --> 01:45:49,446
What? Running away?!

1431
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:55,230
<i>Humph...
They're all useless, every last one of them.</i>

1432
01:45:56,231 --> 01:45:58,733
<i>The Hidden Leaf ritual aims
to seal the Three-Tails.</i>

1433
01:45:59,067 --> 01:46:02,221
<i>They've chosen a path which will
prevent anyone from using the Three-Tails.</i>

1434
01:46:02,543 --> 01:46:03,961
<i>But I won't allow that.</i>

1435
01:46:13,846 --> 01:46:14,847
Yuukimaru...?

1436
01:46:16,932 --> 01:46:17,933
Guren...

1437
01:46:20,797 --> 01:46:24,843
No... The white camellia
cannot become a red one.

1438
01:46:25,969 --> 01:46:28,972
You promised... that you'll come back!

1439
01:46:36,493 --> 01:46:38,620
Gozu... You...

1440
01:46:58,377 --> 01:46:59,378
<i>Yuukimaru...?</i>

1441
01:47:18,063 --> 01:47:20,715
No! This grass whistle...

1442
01:47:23,402 --> 01:47:24,653
No way...

1443
01:47:25,988 --> 01:47:28,448
No way... It's impossible...

1444
01:47:47,926 --> 01:47:51,388
<i>Did I kill that boy's mother...?!</i>

1445
01:47:52,169 --> 01:47:54,032
<i>That's... That's...!</i>

1446
01:47:54,057 --> 01:47:55,058
Guren...

1447
01:47:56,685 --> 01:47:57,487
We must go.

1448
01:47:57,512 --> 01:48:00,890
You?! I thought you'd returned
to Lord Orochimaru.

1449
01:48:01,452 --> 01:48:02,995
There's something more pressing.

1450
01:48:03,468 --> 01:48:06,346
The Hidden Leaf has started
to seal the Three-Tails.

1451
01:48:06,570 --> 01:48:07,571
What?

1452
01:48:08,151 --> 01:48:10,611
We'll use Yuukimaru to
control the Three-Tails.

1453
01:48:10,851 --> 01:48:13,020
And we'll destroy their barrier.

1454
01:48:15,621 --> 01:48:17,456
Kabuto, I need to talk to you.

1455
01:48:18,207 --> 01:48:20,251
What, at a time like this?

1456
01:48:20,584 --> 01:48:21,460
I know that.

1457
01:48:21,485 --> 01:48:23,863
But you of all people should know
what would happen

1458
01:48:23,983 --> 01:48:27,028
if we make Yuukimaru use
his powers any further...

1459
01:48:27,216 --> 01:48:29,510
Huh? Is that all?

1460
01:48:29,756 --> 01:48:31,466
Tell me the truth!

1461
01:48:31,580 --> 01:48:33,165
Why are you so upset?

1462
01:48:33,399 --> 01:48:37,403
It's none of your business
whether Yuukimaru lives or dies.

1463
01:48:39,603 --> 01:48:41,438
It is... my business.

1464
01:48:41,687 --> 01:48:45,525
Oh? So even the devil sheds tears?

1465
01:48:46,193 --> 01:48:49,988
To think that you,
who have killed countless people,

1466
01:48:50,051 --> 01:48:52,470
would have a soft spot for Yuukimaru.

1467
01:48:52,754 --> 01:48:54,381
Now that is a surprise.

1468
01:48:54,423 --> 01:48:56,008
He's special...

1469
01:48:56,328 --> 01:48:58,705
Because you killed his mother?

1470
01:48:58,730 --> 01:49:00,107
How did you...?

1471
01:49:00,172 --> 01:49:01,882
There's nothing unusual about that.

1472
01:49:02,459 --> 01:49:04,836
It's as Lord Orochimaru predicted.

1473
01:49:05,337 --> 01:49:07,923
He knew that you would
have feelings for the boy.

1474
01:49:08,770 --> 01:49:10,856
That's exactly why he chose you.

1475
01:49:13,178 --> 01:49:17,099
If you like,
I can tell Yuukimaru for you...

1476
01:49:18,392 --> 01:49:20,477
That the kind, gentle Guren
whom he believes

1477
01:49:20,502 --> 01:49:22,462
is the one he should return to...

1478
01:49:22,855 --> 01:49:26,943
is the very person
who killed his mother...

1479
01:49:26,984 --> 01:49:27,985
Stop!

1480
01:49:28,525 --> 01:49:32,028
Then, carry out my orders.

1481
01:49:53,232 --> 01:49:54,233
Tenten...

1482
01:49:54,274 --> 01:49:56,235
We don't know when
the enemy will appear again.

1483
01:49:56,443 --> 01:49:57,819
Please stay alert.

1484
01:50:06,161 --> 01:50:08,163
You endeared him to you very skillfully...

1485
01:50:15,546 --> 01:50:16,880
<i>Lord Orochimaru...</i>

1486
01:50:17,339 --> 01:50:21,260
<i>I hate to admit it,
but you were right to select that woman...</i>

1487
01:50:23,136 --> 01:50:27,641
<i>Guren will grow to love Yuukimaru?
Is that even possible?</i>

1488
01:50:29,059 --> 01:50:32,729
<i>Kabuto, you have much to learn.</i>

1489
01:50:33,188 --> 01:50:35,857
<i>The more time you spend with someone,</i>

1490
01:50:36,024 --> 01:50:38,235
<i>the stronger the bond becomes.</i>

1491
01:50:38,735 --> 01:50:41,238
<i>That is human nature.</i>

1492
01:50:41,446 --> 01:50:42,698
<i>Is that so...?</i>

1493
01:50:43,198 --> 01:50:46,368
<i>Those two...
Their ties go deep indeed.</i>

1494
01:50:46,868 --> 01:50:52,165
<i>It's likely that Guren will disobey
my order and betray me.</i>

1495
01:50:52,583 --> 01:50:54,066
<i>Then...</i>

1496
01:50:59,284 --> 01:51:02,954
<i>I guess that time has come...
Lord Orochimaru...</i>

1497
01:51:04,928 --> 01:51:05,971
We're almost there.

1498
01:51:06,513 --> 01:51:08,223
Are you ready, Yuukimaru?

1499
01:51:08,932 --> 01:51:10,892
Do I really have to do this?

1500
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:13,186
That is your duty.

1501
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:15,981
But I know it's going to make me
feel awful again...

1502
01:51:29,244 --> 01:51:30,245
How is it?

1503
01:51:30,245 --> 01:51:31,788
There's been no reaction.

1504
01:51:32,276 --> 01:51:33,277
I see...

1505
01:51:34,916 --> 01:51:38,920
She used up considerable chakra
during that last encounter.

1506
01:51:40,756 --> 01:51:42,215
This is the time to strike.

1507
01:51:42,633 --> 01:51:44,801
I don't want to give her too much time.

1508
01:51:45,344 --> 01:51:48,180
I agree. I'm going to widen
the scope of my search.

1509
01:52:14,122 --> 01:52:16,416
Damn, what's going on...?

1510
01:52:16,750 --> 01:52:20,837
This is the pits.
You guys are on the verge of death.

1511
01:52:21,213 --> 01:52:23,590
Hah! Speak for yourself.

1512
01:52:24,424 --> 01:52:27,552
Oh... I feel like I'm going to faint...

1513
01:52:28,595 --> 01:52:31,348
As if I'm going to die in a place like this!

1514
01:52:31,627 --> 01:52:34,922
Not after we survived
that hellhole of a camp.

1515
01:52:40,023 --> 01:52:42,317
That's the seal to capture the Three-Tails.

1516
01:52:43,443 --> 01:52:47,322
This is bad. They're well into the ritual.

1517
01:52:48,240 --> 01:52:49,700
Now then, Yuukimaru...

1518
01:52:54,733 --> 01:52:56,318
We don't have time...!

1519
01:52:56,765 --> 01:52:58,975
Hey Guren, do something.

1520
01:52:59,751 --> 01:53:00,877
Guren...

1521
01:53:01,837 --> 01:53:03,130
Never mind!

1522
01:53:10,554 --> 01:53:12,556
You... Are you going to betray us?

1523
01:53:13,233 --> 01:53:14,985
I have no intention of defying you.

1524
01:53:15,337 --> 01:53:18,007
But that jutsu will
cause too much damage.

1525
01:53:18,507 --> 01:53:19,716
So please...

1526
01:53:20,342 --> 01:53:22,886
Let me try one more time.

1527
01:53:23,322 --> 01:53:25,991
Not that again?
At a time like this?

1528
01:53:26,153 --> 01:53:31,450
In your reluctance to use Yuukimaru,
you've lost almost all your men.

1529
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:34,231
On top of that,
you yourself have been beaten...

1530
01:53:34,745 --> 01:53:37,581
And you still think you can fight?

1531
01:53:38,729 --> 01:53:39,695
That's...

1532
01:53:40,917 --> 01:53:43,587
The least you can do in that state is...

1533
01:53:45,046 --> 01:53:49,342
Well... There is a way without
using Yuukimaru.

1534
01:53:51,219 --> 01:53:53,472
But time is of the essence.

1535
01:53:53,834 --> 01:53:57,420
This is on the condition that
you follow my orders completely.

1536
01:53:57,809 --> 01:53:58,894
I understand.

1537
01:53:59,506 --> 01:54:02,384
The minute you show signs of defiance,

1538
01:54:02,410 --> 01:54:06,122
or if you fail, I won't
hesitate to use him.

1539
01:54:07,027 --> 01:54:08,153
Yeah...

1540
01:54:08,904 --> 01:54:10,906
Humph, all right then.

1541
01:54:11,656 --> 01:54:12,824
Come, Yuukimaru.

1542
01:54:13,366 --> 01:54:17,120
Don't worry.
I'm taking him where he'll be safe.

1543
01:54:21,792 --> 01:54:23,752
And what's the plan?

1544
01:54:24,586 --> 01:54:28,840
I'll tell Rinji the plan.
You just follow his instructions.

1545
01:54:48,610 --> 01:54:51,321
The Three-Tails' power
won't reach you here.

1546
01:54:51,934 --> 01:54:54,311
Will Guren be okay...?

1547
01:54:54,477 --> 01:54:56,479
She's the one who insisted on this.

1548
01:54:56,772 --> 01:54:59,191
She'll have to do it even if it kills her.

1549
01:55:00,956 --> 01:55:02,457
Do not move from this spot.

1550
01:55:08,534 --> 01:55:10,286
Tell me the plan.

1551
01:55:11,995 --> 01:55:13,234
Guren...

1552
01:55:14,957 --> 01:55:17,710
Hurry it up. You're wasting time.

1553
01:55:18,326 --> 01:55:23,248
Yes. According to Kabuto,
there are two guarding the seal;

1554
01:55:23,311 --> 01:55:25,522
one is a weapons user
and the other a taijutsu user.

1555
01:55:25,772 --> 01:55:27,816
They've already gone through
a surprise attack,

1556
01:55:27,858 --> 01:55:30,110
so they've increased their guard.

1557
01:55:30,360 --> 01:55:31,611
I see.

1558
01:55:31,987 --> 01:55:35,532
In other words, the way to catch
their attention is a flashy diversion.

1559
01:55:36,324 --> 01:55:38,368
A decoy is necessary.

1560
01:55:39,661 --> 01:55:42,330
All right. Let's do it.

1561
01:55:42,484 --> 01:55:44,361
I'll take care of those two in front.

1562
01:55:44,749 --> 01:55:47,210
But are you sure about this, Guren...?

1563
01:55:48,086 --> 01:55:51,423
I have enough chakra to be a decoy.

1564
01:55:52,007 --> 01:55:55,635
You focus on finding
the right moment to break the seal.

1565
01:56:02,100 --> 01:56:04,811
The Three-Tails is completely
ensnared within the seal.

1566
01:56:04,895 --> 01:56:09,024
Good. Now let's narrow the sphere
of the Four-Corner Sealing Barrier

1567
01:56:09,024 --> 01:56:11,318
until the Three-Tails' freedom
is totally restricted!

1568
01:56:11,568 --> 01:56:12,170
- Yes!
- Yes!

1569
01:56:13,724 --> 01:56:15,768
- Huh?! Tenten!
- I know!

1570
01:56:18,478 --> 01:56:19,479
Who's there?!

1571
01:56:23,204 --> 01:56:27,626
Two kids protecting the precious seal?
What a laugh.

1572
01:56:29,502 --> 01:56:30,921
That jutsu...!

1573
01:56:30,921 --> 01:56:32,756
Are you the Crystal Style user?!

1574
01:56:33,048 --> 01:56:35,550
Isn't the Crystal Style Counter team
supposed to deal with her?!

1575
01:56:35,634 --> 01:56:37,010
So what'll you do?

1576
01:56:37,052 --> 01:56:38,595
Are you going to run with
your tails between your legs?

1577
01:56:38,595 --> 01:56:41,723
No such thing!
I'd like nothing better than to battle

1578
01:56:41,793 --> 01:56:43,294
the Crystal Style user
everyone's been talking about!

1579
01:56:43,310 --> 01:56:46,438
That's some confidence...
for a kid from the Hidden Leaf!

1580
01:56:49,522 --> 01:56:51,024
Concentrate, everyone!

1581
01:56:51,393 --> 01:56:53,270
The net is tight enough!

1582
01:56:53,347 --> 01:56:56,934
Now we'll lock it from all four sides
and completely seal the Three-Tails!

1583
01:56:57,392 --> 01:56:58,219
- Right!
- Right!

1584
01:56:58,856 --> 01:57:01,150
<i>Four-Corner Sealing Barrier... Lock!</i>

1585
01:57:46,233 --> 01:57:47,484
I'm your opponent!

1586
01:57:55,755 --> 01:57:58,049
This resistance is strange...
It's as though...

1587
01:58:00,581 --> 01:58:02,208
Too bad.

1588
01:58:02,457 --> 01:58:04,459
She covered her body with crystal...?

1589
01:58:04,744 --> 01:58:06,141
<i>Damn...</i>

1590
01:58:06,182 --> 01:58:08,893
<i>Normally, I'd have beaten enemies
like them long ago.</i>

1591
01:58:09,131 --> 01:58:10,210
Not yet!

1592
01:58:22,105 --> 01:58:23,755
<i>Judging from the chakra I have left,</i>

1593
01:58:23,770 --> 01:58:26,648
<i>there's just one or two more jutsu
I can use.</i>

1594
01:58:27,065 --> 01:58:28,066
<i>If that's the case!</i>

1595
01:58:35,587 --> 01:58:37,005
<i>I'll end it with this next one!</i>

1596
01:58:46,668 --> 01:58:47,519
Ino!

1597
01:58:50,589 --> 01:58:51,840
<i>My control...</i>

1598
01:58:52,883 --> 01:58:54,021
<i>Did we fail?</i>

1599
01:58:54,481 --> 01:58:55,523
I'm sorry!

1600
01:58:55,523 --> 01:58:58,526
The net isn't broken yet! Synchronize!

1601
01:58:58,639 --> 01:59:00,641
We'll lock the seal once more!

1602
01:59:02,260 --> 01:59:03,644
Die!

1603
01:59:10,246 --> 01:59:11,247
Now!

1604
01:59:22,746 --> 01:59:24,623
- This is bad!
- Crap!

1605
01:59:24,677 --> 01:59:25,386
Eat this!

1606
01:59:25,428 --> 01:59:27,555
<i>Collaboration Ninjutsu!
Wind Style: Toad Water Pistol!</i>

1607
01:59:28,502 --> 01:59:29,349
What?!

1608
01:59:32,631 --> 01:59:33,673
Naruto...!

1609
01:59:33,757 --> 01:59:35,718
Yay, we did it!

1610
01:59:35,818 --> 01:59:37,695
That's the way it should be!

1611
01:59:37,979 --> 01:59:40,440
I finally found you, Crystal Style user!

1612
01:59:40,764 --> 01:59:41,974
Why you--!

1613
01:59:45,894 --> 01:59:48,897
<i>Whatever it takes...
that seal must be broken!</i>

1614
01:59:49,606 --> 01:59:50,254
Shino!

1615
01:59:57,710 --> 01:59:58,711
Wh-What?!

1616
02:00:01,548 --> 02:00:02,715
The seal!

1617
02:00:20,233 --> 02:00:21,109
Senpai.

1618
02:00:21,234 --> 02:00:22,235
Hmm?

1619
02:00:24,933 --> 02:00:25,934
It's you, Yamato.

1620
02:00:29,354 --> 02:00:33,150
As you predicted, we encountered
the enemy's diversionary team.

1621
02:00:33,436 --> 02:00:37,815
But they weren't very strong and ran off.

1622
02:00:38,071 --> 02:00:39,740
Then we split up into two...

1623
02:00:39,866 --> 02:00:43,036
I sent Lee and Tenten
to protect the Sealing team.

1624
02:00:44,286 --> 02:00:45,287
How about you?

1625
02:00:45,853 --> 02:00:47,021
It's bad.

1626
02:00:47,059 --> 02:00:49,312
We found a way to counter
the Crystal Style,

1627
02:00:49,476 --> 02:00:50,769
but she gave us the slip.

1628
02:00:51,168 --> 02:00:52,044
What?!

1629
02:00:52,084 --> 02:00:55,125
Quickly, go help protect
the Sealing team.

1630
02:01:00,565 --> 02:01:01,388
Damn it!

1631
02:01:12,606 --> 02:01:14,608
We won't be able to sustain the barrier!

1632
02:01:19,112 --> 02:01:20,530
I-It's so huge...!

1633
02:01:20,864 --> 02:01:22,157
Wha--?! What is this?!

1634
02:01:28,885 --> 02:01:29,886
Oh no!

1635
02:01:36,380 --> 02:01:39,591
What chakra! This is the Three-Tails...!

1636
02:01:40,939 --> 02:01:42,440
The barrier is broken!

1637
02:02:06,172 --> 02:02:08,758
Brother... I'm scared!

1638
02:02:08,841 --> 02:02:11,052
That shock wave...!

1639
02:02:11,219 --> 02:02:14,931
What kind of dangerous place
have you summoned us to this time?!

1640
02:02:15,139 --> 02:02:17,433
This isn't the time to talk like that!

1641
02:02:22,676 --> 02:02:24,428
Our goal has been achieved.

1642
02:02:24,678 --> 02:02:28,599
You've lost the jutsu
to seal the Three-Tails.

1643
02:02:29,237 --> 02:02:31,531
Why you... I can't forgive you!

1644
02:02:33,228 --> 02:02:34,472
Rinji, pull back!

1645
02:02:35,368 --> 02:02:36,440
You won't get away!

1646
02:03:01,394 --> 02:03:03,187
No!

1647
02:03:52,070 --> 02:03:53,154
Guren...

1648
02:04:15,009 --> 02:04:16,552
G-Guren!

1649
02:04:30,566 --> 02:04:31,901
Get away!

1650
02:04:39,492 --> 02:04:40,576
Where'd they go...?

1651
02:04:41,536 --> 02:04:42,537
There...

1652
02:05:03,891 --> 02:05:04,934
No!

1653
02:05:10,982 --> 02:05:11,983
No...!

1654
02:05:12,900 --> 02:05:13,901
Stop...!

1655
02:05:14,681 --> 02:05:15,848
Don't!

1656
02:05:17,738 --> 02:05:22,660
No...!

1657
02:05:23,398 --> 02:05:27,361
<i>Kabuto... You seem to be
having a hard time</i>

1658
02:05:27,599 --> 02:05:29,860
<i>drawing out Yuukimaru's power.</i>

1659
02:05:33,325 --> 02:05:38,581
<i>If you try to force it out,
it won't be real power.</i>

1660
02:05:39,998 --> 02:05:44,294
<i>When there is true desire in the heart
and that desire is strong...</i>

1661
02:05:44,753 --> 02:05:51,677
<i>that is when he finds real strength
that even he did not know he had!</i>

1662
02:05:56,694 --> 02:05:57,737
What is that...?

1663
02:05:59,226 --> 02:06:01,186
I've seen it before...

1664
02:06:02,604 --> 02:06:04,856
It's just like back then...

1665
02:06:25,794 --> 02:06:26,795
Yuukimaru!

1666
02:06:33,606 --> 02:06:34,364
Huh?!

1667
02:06:41,894 --> 02:06:42,685
Yuukimaru!

1668
02:06:47,733 --> 02:06:48,859
<i>Guren...!</i>

1669
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:56,629
That Tailed Beast was going crazy...
so what happened to it?

1670
02:07:01,413 --> 02:07:02,914
Is everyone all right?!

1671
02:07:03,686 --> 02:07:05,312
Thank you, Lee.

1672
02:07:05,644 --> 02:07:08,438
We've used up considerable chakra,
but we're all right.

1673
02:07:09,796 --> 02:07:13,925
<i>The Three-Tails' chakra was enormous
and yet...</i>

1674
02:07:16,512 --> 02:07:17,638
Captain Yamato!

1675
02:07:17,909 --> 02:07:22,789
Yeah, I know!
But recouping takes priority.

1676
02:07:23,810 --> 02:07:26,313
We will join up with
the Sealing team as ordered.

1677
02:07:26,336 --> 02:07:27,206
Right!

1678
02:07:30,192 --> 02:07:32,152
<i>Just what happened anyway...?</i>

1679
02:07:35,322 --> 02:07:37,616
I'm concerned about Naruto
and the others. Let's hurry!

1680
02:07:37,626 --> 02:07:38,627
Yes.

1681
02:07:54,174 --> 02:07:57,052
Guren's crisis triggered
the power surge?

1682
02:07:57,845 --> 02:08:00,723
Well now... This is worth testing.

1683
02:08:27,708 --> 02:08:31,128
I'm glad... that you're all right, Guren.

1684
02:08:36,758 --> 02:08:37,842
<i>But...</i>

1685
02:08:38,814 --> 02:08:40,816
<i>My mother never returned.</i>

1686
02:08:41,388 --> 02:08:43,056
<i>Everyone has left.</i>

1687
02:08:43,903 --> 02:08:46,197
<i>Is he talking about his hometown?</i>

1688
02:08:48,449 --> 02:08:51,661
<i>He lost the place
where he could return to...</i>

1689
02:08:56,582 --> 02:08:57,625
<i>Yuukimaru...?</i>

1690
02:09:22,900 --> 02:09:24,944
<i>What have I done...?</i>

1691
02:09:26,266 --> 02:09:28,852
<i>Forgive me... Yuukimaru...</i>

1692
02:09:30,437 --> 02:09:32,063
Guren, hurry...

1693
02:09:32,451 --> 02:09:34,120
Run...

1694
02:09:44,213 --> 02:09:45,214
That's...!

1695
02:09:45,881 --> 02:09:47,508
<i>You... This is...!</i>

1696
02:09:48,134 --> 02:09:49,802
<i>I have this, so...</i>

1697
02:09:49,969 --> 02:09:51,178
<i>You know...</i>

1698
02:09:51,303 --> 02:09:53,431
<i>This one is for you, Guren.</i>

1699
02:09:55,349 --> 02:09:57,852
<i>You want to exchange it, right?
All right.</i>

1700
02:10:08,738 --> 02:10:11,615
<i>This time, I'll hold your hand...</i>

1701
02:10:18,164 --> 02:10:20,916
Hurry... hurry...

1702
02:10:22,334 --> 02:10:23,753
<i>And yet...</i>

1703
02:10:28,787 --> 02:10:31,331
<i>Someone like me...</i>

1704
02:10:36,348 --> 02:10:38,350
<i>is in your thoughts?!</i>

1705
02:10:48,348 --> 02:10:49,349
Yuukimaru!

1706
02:10:50,488 --> 02:10:51,576
Guren!

1707
02:10:53,991 --> 02:10:55,868
I told you to wait...

1708
02:10:56,410 --> 02:10:59,413
But... I was worried about you...

1709
02:10:59,914 --> 02:11:03,042
And I thought if I keep thinking about you,
you'll come back.

1710
02:11:04,156 --> 02:11:06,262
<i>The place where Yuukimaru
can return to...</i>

1711
02:11:06,712 --> 02:11:08,494
<i>I stole that from him...</i>

1712
02:11:09,590 --> 02:11:11,967
<i>What I can do for him is...</i>

1713
02:11:12,831 --> 02:11:17,544
<i>If I'll do...
If that's what you want...</i>

1714
02:11:18,474 --> 02:11:22,228
<i>I'll... I'll be the place
you can return to.</i>

1715
02:11:25,356 --> 02:11:28,108
Is the touching reunion over?

1716
02:11:28,734 --> 02:11:29,602
Rinji?!

1717
02:11:33,227 --> 02:11:34,854
Yuukimaru! Get down!

1718
02:11:50,089 --> 02:11:52,758
We successfully thwarted
the sealing of the Three-Tails.

1719
02:11:52,996 --> 02:11:54,789
I'm taking Yuukimaru and leaving.

1720
02:11:56,416 --> 02:11:58,043
So you were the one.

1721
02:11:58,230 --> 02:12:00,315
What are you babbling about?

1722
02:12:02,309 --> 02:12:07,022
Look, for Lord Orochimaru's sake,
let's be friends.

1723
02:12:07,606 --> 02:12:11,819
After all, you're the tool that
controls the beast.

1724
02:12:12,558 --> 02:12:15,436
You're the one who can trigger
Yuukimaru's actions.

1725
02:12:15,853 --> 02:12:17,730
You... Why?!

1726
02:12:24,194 --> 02:12:25,056
Guren!

1727
02:12:42,516 --> 02:12:44,310
Are you all right?! Guren!

1728
02:12:50,190 --> 02:12:51,609
I'm okay...

1729
02:12:51,734 --> 02:12:52,985
I'm glad...

1730
02:12:54,069 --> 02:12:56,683
Because... I have this.

1731
02:12:57,239 --> 02:12:58,240
Uh-huh...

1732
02:13:00,451 --> 02:13:01,452
Me too.

1733
02:13:03,746 --> 02:13:05,122
Huh?! Guren!

1734
02:13:16,634 --> 02:13:18,886
<i>That was Mom's grass whistle just now.</i>

1735
02:13:18,928 --> 02:13:21,221
<i>I can see the red camellia at last!</i>

1736
02:13:30,064 --> 02:13:35,319
<i>Mother...!</i>

1737
02:13:39,073 --> 02:13:40,074
No...

1738
02:13:40,646 --> 02:13:42,314
This can't be...

1739
02:13:56,715 --> 02:13:57,716
Yuukimaru!

1740
02:14:02,096 --> 02:14:03,099
Yuukimaru.

1741
02:14:03,722 --> 02:14:06,141
Guren is in no condition to move.

1742
02:14:06,380 --> 02:14:08,185
You have to stop the Three-Tails...

1743
02:14:14,942 --> 02:14:16,235
Yuukimaru!

1744
02:14:17,945 --> 02:14:20,322
Guren will die if you don't do anything!

1745
02:14:34,545 --> 02:14:35,629
No...

1746
02:14:36,922 --> 02:14:39,800
Guren is the place I return to.

1747
02:14:40,259 --> 02:14:41,927
Yes, Yuukimaru.

1748
02:14:42,136 --> 02:14:44,763
When your beloved Guren
is in danger,

1749
02:14:44,805 --> 02:14:47,141
that is when your powers awaken.

1750
02:14:47,641 --> 02:14:51,603
If you don't stop the Three-Tails,
Guren will be killed!

1751
02:15:14,960 --> 02:15:16,128
No...

1752
02:15:18,047 --> 02:15:19,131
Not that...

1753
02:15:20,883 --> 02:15:25,596
I don't want that to happen!

1754
02:15:46,950 --> 02:15:50,120
Wow, that's amazing...
It worked even better than I expected!

1755
02:15:52,236 --> 02:15:55,322
I have no doubt... Yuukimaru is here!

1756
02:15:56,031 --> 02:15:56,777
Naruto!

1757
02:15:57,991 --> 02:15:59,492
You're late, Kakashi-sensei!

1758
02:16:00,034 --> 02:16:02,161
What's that light? What's going on?

1759
02:16:02,746 --> 02:16:05,332
It's him! Yuukimaru is here!

1760
02:16:05,766 --> 02:16:08,394
You mean, the boy who controls
the Three-Tails?

1761
02:16:09,124 --> 02:16:10,974
We have to go and save him!

1762
02:16:11,024 --> 02:16:12,150
Wait, Naruto!

1763
02:16:13,757 --> 02:16:14,800
There's been a change of plans.

1764
02:16:14,828 --> 02:16:17,831
We're going to protect the boy
who controls the Three-Tails.

1765
02:16:18,087 --> 02:16:18,971
Let's follow Naruto!

1766
02:16:19,007 --> 02:16:20,008
- Right!
- Right!

1767
02:16:20,317 --> 02:16:22,194
<i>Wait for me, Yuukimaru!</i>

1768
02:17:12,786 --> 02:17:14,413
<i>That's his limit?</i>

1769
02:17:15,152 --> 02:17:17,863
<i>He's a kid, after all...
He's running out of chakra.</i>

1770
02:17:26,872 --> 02:17:27,760
<i>Damn it!</i>

1771
02:17:38,675 --> 02:17:39,842
I have to save her!

1772
02:17:50,062 --> 02:17:51,772
I have to save Guren...!

1773
02:18:20,145 --> 02:18:23,273
Don't come! Go away! Guren is...

1774
02:18:23,690 --> 02:18:26,777
Guren is the place I can return to!

1775
02:18:35,494 --> 02:18:36,495
Guren!

1776
02:18:39,945 --> 02:18:41,947
I won't let you kill Yuukimaru!

1777
02:18:42,459 --> 02:18:44,670
You stay back, got it?

1778
02:18:44,962 --> 02:18:45,963
Okay.

1779
02:18:47,339 --> 02:18:51,051
<i>Crystal Style: Crimson Fruit!</i>

1780
02:18:54,972 --> 02:18:56,056
<i>Guren!</i>

1781
02:18:56,974 --> 02:19:00,560
If you stay there,
you'll be safe from any kind of attack.

1782
02:19:01,436 --> 02:19:02,187
<i>Okay.</i>

1783
02:19:02,229 --> 02:19:03,772
Stay there and wait for me.

1784
02:19:04,064 --> 02:19:05,774
<i>Be careful, Guren!</i>

1785
02:19:06,108 --> 02:19:08,360
There's no need to worry about me!

1786
02:19:13,824 --> 02:19:16,076
I'm coming for you, Yuukimaru!

1787
02:19:23,834 --> 02:19:27,004
<i>I have to keep it away from Yuukimaru.</i>

1788
02:19:38,473 --> 02:19:41,768
Damn it...
We can't carelessly close in...

1789
02:19:42,477 --> 02:19:43,478
Naruto!

1790
02:19:49,264 --> 02:19:50,307
Yuukimaru!

1791
02:19:50,819 --> 02:19:52,529
Where are you, Yuukimaru?!

1792
02:19:56,700 --> 02:19:59,328
<i>Crystal Style: Hexagonal Shuriken Wild Dance!</i>

1793
02:20:11,340 --> 02:20:12,341
He's...

1794
02:20:14,176 --> 02:20:15,719
going for Yuukimaru!

1795
02:20:16,458 --> 02:20:17,876
Like I'd let you!

1796
02:20:23,852 --> 02:20:26,146
<i>I have to stop him somehow...</i>

1797
02:20:26,480 --> 02:20:27,647
<i>Guren...</i>

1798
02:20:44,081 --> 02:20:45,415
Not... yet!

1799
02:20:48,502 --> 02:20:51,713
<i>Crystal Style: Crystal Wall, 8th Formation!</i>

1800
02:20:57,344 --> 02:21:00,972
<i>I guess...
my chakra is reaching its limit...</i>

1801
02:21:05,299 --> 02:21:06,383
The Three-Tails?

1802
02:21:10,721 --> 02:21:11,740
She's...!

1803
02:21:15,070 --> 02:21:17,030
Is that... Yuukimaru?

1804
02:21:19,449 --> 02:21:21,660
He's... the ninja from the Leaf!

1805
02:21:25,747 --> 02:21:26,748
What?!

1806
02:21:29,918 --> 02:21:30,919
Crap!

1807
02:21:32,045 --> 02:21:33,171
Come on!

1808
02:21:33,922 --> 02:21:36,174
I-It's too big!

1809
02:21:42,294 --> 02:21:44,379
I won't let you touch Yuukimaru!

1810
02:21:44,505 --> 02:21:47,425
I'm here to take him from you!

1811
02:21:48,050 --> 02:21:49,510
But before that...

1812
02:21:51,481 --> 02:21:53,316
It seems there's something
I have to do!

1813
02:22:07,372 --> 02:22:09,082
Go!

1814
02:22:15,172 --> 02:22:20,886
Damn, he's so tough!
I can't find a single weakness.

1815
02:22:21,094 --> 02:22:23,096
You're pretty dumb, aren't you?

1816
02:22:23,555 --> 02:22:25,474
Are you picking a fight with me?!

1817
02:22:25,891 --> 02:22:28,310
The fact that a guy like him defends it

1818
02:22:28,507 --> 02:22:31,135
means there's a spot that
he doesn't want you to attack, right?

1819
02:22:44,784 --> 02:22:48,413
You're all talk! Damn!

1820
02:22:49,945 --> 02:22:52,864
<i>A short time... Just a short while...</i>

1821
02:22:54,074 --> 02:22:56,743
<i>Change my life into chakra...</i>

1822
02:22:59,925 --> 02:23:01,635
<i>Chakra points! Life and Death!</i>

1823
02:23:17,275 --> 02:23:18,276
Guren!

1824
02:23:19,277 --> 02:23:22,072
<i>Crystal Style: Arrow of Light!</i>

1825
02:23:29,996 --> 02:23:32,707
There's no way to harden an eyeball,
that's for sure!

1826
02:23:33,363 --> 02:23:34,364
Eat this!

1827
02:23:34,501 --> 02:23:36,628
<i>Giant Rasengan!</i>

1828
02:23:41,841 --> 02:23:42,968
That did it!

1829
02:24:04,353 --> 02:24:07,148
You're pretty good.

1830
02:24:08,910 --> 02:24:11,871
Next, I'll settle things with you!

1831
02:24:15,875 --> 02:24:16,876
What?!

1832
02:24:43,517 --> 02:24:46,099
This is the boy Naruto was talking about.

1833
02:24:56,708 --> 02:24:59,169
Damn... This is an utter failure...

1834
02:25:05,008 --> 02:25:08,094
I must get Yuukimaru back,
no matter what...
