1
00:01:43,821 --> 00:01:46,532
Danzo may be thinking about
conspiring with Orochimaru

2
00:01:46,557 --> 00:01:50,519
and have him attack the Leaf Village
one more time...

3
00:01:51,105 --> 00:01:54,624
in order to force Lady Tsunade
from her position as Hokage...

4
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:58,271
So, you're saying they want to destroy
the Leaf Village just because of that?

5
00:01:58,296 --> 00:01:59,919
It's not only because of that!

6
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:05,834
He wants to build his ideal village
after destroying the regime...

7
00:02:06,141 --> 00:02:09,211
and take center stage as Hokage.

8
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,468
The reason Danzo is making
his move now is...

9
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,327
... because he sees it's been three years
since the last attack,

10
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:22,607
so there has been enough time for
Orochimaru to fully regain his forces.

11
00:02:23,514 --> 00:02:24,867
I think that's also part of it.

12
00:02:25,495 --> 00:02:28,000
Or he may have thought
Orochimaru is more cautious now

13
00:02:28,025 --> 00:02:31,778
because of the failure
of the last attack.

14
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:35,446
If he acts now, he thinks
the negotiations with Orochimaru...

15
00:02:35,471 --> 00:02:37,448
will proceed more easily.

16
00:02:38,037 --> 00:02:41,498
That means he's going to propose a
village-endorsed collaboration, right?

17
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:43,501
Yes...

18
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:49,486
You mean,
Sai's top secret mission...

19
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,214
... is probably to earn Orochimaru's trust

20
00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:56,412
and serve as a liaison between
Danzo and Orochimaru.

21
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,347
He thought the odds of him
running into Orochimaru...

22
00:03:01,372 --> 00:03:03,291
would be high
if he was in our group.

23
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,357
That can't be...!

24
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,438
Then we might have to eliminate Sai.

25
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,067
Eliminate?

26
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:28,917
Sakura!

27
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:34,540
Sakura!

28
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,139
Sakura...

29
00:03:44,929 --> 00:03:46,306
That wound is...

30
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:49,737
<i>Chakra of the Nine-Tailed Fox
must have entered...</i>

31
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:52,306
<i>through the wound like poison...</i>

32
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,484
<i>That's why...</i>

33
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,187
<i>That's why I'm even more surprised</i>

34
00:03:57,212 --> 00:03:59,547
<i>that Naruto has been able
to endure that chakra.</i>

35
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,012
This... was done by Orochimaru.

36
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:08,790
Well, it hurts only a little, so...
I'm okay.

37
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,586
Don't push yourself
too hard, Sakura.

38
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,005
I got it...

39
00:04:22,433 --> 00:04:23,893
Let's take a little break.

40
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,744
Sakura is our team's
only medical ninja...

41
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,770
In other words, she's a crucial part
of this mission's success.

42
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:34,037
I'm all right. If we don't leave now...

43
00:04:35,214 --> 00:04:38,008
I mean, there is a difference between
hurrying and recklessness.

44
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:40,129
I agree!

45
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:43,408
Captain Yamato is right!

46
00:04:43,758 --> 00:04:46,803
You are the only medical ninja
in our group

47
00:04:47,107 --> 00:04:48,858
with monstrous strength...

48
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,057
So, you're our precious cornerstone...

49
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,428
I told you that you don't need
to add "monstrous strength"!

50
00:04:53,453 --> 00:04:55,288
- What, what?!
- Shut up!

51
00:04:55,397 --> 00:04:57,524
I'm just complimenting your...

52
00:04:57,549 --> 00:05:00,453
O-Okay, okay...
I apologize!

53
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,634
Naruto!

54
00:05:02,267 --> 00:05:05,979
Since Sai's out, you'll be
my partner for the battle.

55
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:09,183
Let's work out some combination attacks
while we have time.

56
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:11,050
Can you come over here for a bit?

57
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,187
Got it.

58
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,624
<i>This is far enough...</i>

59
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,044
All right! So, what are
we going to do first?

60
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:40,323
But before that...
There's something I need to tell you.

61
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,472
You're the one...
who hurt Sakura, Naruto.

62
00:06:10,481 --> 00:06:11,815
<i>Naruto...</i>

63
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:20,295
<i>you...</i>

64
00:06:21,884 --> 00:06:25,179
<i>don't... remember anything...?</i>

65
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:33,559
Then... that bridge...
and that crater...

66
00:06:34,387 --> 00:06:36,765
Yes, you did it...

67
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,857
Sakura didn't want
to hurt you...

68
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,360
so she lied to you.

69
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:51,077
I'm also responsible
for Sakura getting injured.

70
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,972
And here I was assigned
to Team Kakashi...

71
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,291
for a time like this...

72
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,453
I have special powers...

73
00:07:01,276 --> 00:07:06,796
with which I can control
your Nine-Tails power.

74
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,430
So you don't really
need to worry.

75
00:07:11,771 --> 00:07:15,817
At least...
while I'm by your side.

76
00:07:19,663 --> 00:07:22,166
In other words, I didn't have
to go to the trouble

77
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,360
of telling you the truth
at this point...

78
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,784
But why did I tell you?

79
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:35,329
There's no doubt that
using that power

80
00:07:35,677 --> 00:07:38,321
might be the fastest way for you
to save Sasuke.

81
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,795
But strength gained
from relying on the Nine-Tails...

82
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,964
is not your true power.

83
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:49,719
You'll end up tormenting yourself
if you rely on the power...

84
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:52,519
of the Nine-Tails from here on.

85
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,975
And it could turn into a power
that hurts your friends.

86
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,436
Like what happened this time.

87
00:08:02,422 --> 00:08:04,967
You must have already realized it,
at least vaguely.

88
00:08:05,975 --> 00:08:08,727
But you didn't attempt to stop
the release of the power...

89
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,698
That's because
you were impatient, right?

90
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:16,913
I will now completely suppress
your Nine-Tails power.

91
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:22,110
But you're sorely mistaken if you think
that will make you weaker.

92
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,837
You should be sufficiently powerful...

93
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:27,064
without having to rely on that chakra.

94
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:31,260
The source of your strength
isn't the Nine-Tails chakra.

95
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,643
It's the power of your own chakra...

96
00:08:34,668 --> 00:08:37,212
that can withstand the formidable
Nine-Tails chakra.

97
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:46,275
If you want to save Sasuke,
do it with your own power.

98
00:08:49,456 --> 00:08:51,500
If you want to see Sasuke...

99
00:08:51,915 --> 00:08:54,504
do it with your own eyes,
not the Nine-Tails.

100
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,371
And if you want
to protect Sakura...

101
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,625
do it with your own power,
not the Nine-Tails!

102
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:11,842
Right!

103
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,098
<i>It's okay...
The pain's starting to go away.</i>

104
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,185
<i>Are Naruto and the captain
still at it?</i>

105
00:09:22,706 --> 00:09:23,707
<i>Oh yeah...</i>

106
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,193
<i>Come to think of it,
the thing I picked up earlier...</i>

107
00:09:46,151 --> 00:09:47,152
<i>It's gone...</i>

108
00:09:50,619 --> 00:09:51,454
<i>Here it is...</i>

109
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:08,693
What's the deal...

110
00:10:10,553 --> 00:10:11,345
with this book...?

111
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,239
And then...
in a scenario like this...

112
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:17,950
Hey, are you listen—

113
00:10:17,975 --> 00:10:19,685
Both of you, come here a minute!

114
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,247
Oh! That's Sai's...

115
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:27,394
That's the picture book Sai drew
that we picked up, right?

116
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,546
What's in it?

117
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:32,632
It kind of...

118
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:37,094
looks like a story about the two boys
on the front and back covers...

119
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,224
And... it's got the story
of the two boys...

120
00:10:42,432 --> 00:10:45,268
starting from both the front and back
of the book...

121
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,939
and progressing to the middle...

122
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:58,449
When you look at the book starting with
this boy with black hair...

123
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,493
the next page...

124
00:11:01,046 --> 00:11:03,465
always has the same boy
on the right page...

125
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,875
And there's a different person
drawn on each left page...

126
00:11:08,146 --> 00:11:08,938
See...?

127
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:15,466
Hmm, it looks like it's a story
where the boy defeats enemies...

128
00:11:15,856 --> 00:11:16,982
Look at this...

129
00:11:17,271 --> 00:11:18,397
After fighting,

130
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:21,263
he takes the enemy's weapon
and armor...

131
00:11:26,347 --> 00:11:27,890
The positioning is reversed...

132
00:11:28,235 --> 00:11:31,029
but this boy with the white hair
is the same, too.

133
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:35,986
So it's a story where these boys
grow by battling enemies, huh...?

134
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,197
Just a minute...

135
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,785
If they're defeating enemies
from both sides...

136
00:11:44,318 --> 00:11:46,486
then what happens at the end?!

137
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,361
Let's go.

138
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:18,529
Yes, sir.

139
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,130
<i>Over there, huh...?</i>

140
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,632
<i>Could it be...?!</i>

141
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:47,683
It appears my clone
has located the hideout.

142
00:12:51,276 --> 00:12:52,819
Let's get going.

143
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:21,926
<i>That's...</i>

144
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,016
You're late.

145
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,186
Weren't you supposed to join me

146
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:36,732
for some new jutsu training
this afternoon, Orochimaru?

147
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,568
Speaking so rudely again...

148
00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:42,122
Don't get so angry.

149
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:47,535
Instead, I got a little present
for you today...

150
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:53,123
This is a shinobi from the Leaf,
just like you...

151
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,543
You guys should be able
to exchange...

152
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,445
nostalgic stories of home, right?

153
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,054
How do you do?
My name is Sai.

154
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,306
So you're Sasuke Uchiha—?

155
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,432
Get lost.

156
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:17,147
It seems I'm the type of person
people tend to dislike...

157
00:14:17,695 --> 00:14:19,740
even if I try to make a smile...

158
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,786
Just recently,

159
00:14:22,811 --> 00:14:24,855
Naruto also expressed
his dislike towards me...

160
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,578
But I get the feeling
I'll be able...

161
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,360
to get along better with you
compared to Naruto.

162
00:14:53,867 --> 00:14:54,910
Sasuke!

163
00:15:01,392 --> 00:15:02,518
I'm sweating...?

164
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,327
It's probably not a good idea...

165
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,162
to joke around
with Sasuke too much.

166
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,582
He's even more troublesome
than I am, you see.

167
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,462
I don't care about that guy.

168
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:26,175
Join me right now...
Orochimaru.

169
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:30,119
I've heard a lot about you
from Naruto.

170
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:36,644
It seems he was looking for you
over the last three years...

171
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,397
There was a guy like that, wasn't there?

172
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,569
Let's go, Orochimaru.

173
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,322
Naruto said he thinks of you like...

174
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:52,201
He thinks of you like
a real brother...

175
00:15:52,984 --> 00:15:54,902
That's what I heard from Sakura.

176
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:05,255
I only have... one brother...
the man I want to kill.

177
00:16:13,397 --> 00:16:15,316
Okay, I'll be going, too.

178
00:16:15,917 --> 00:16:20,171
Kabuto, make a Bingo Book using this.

179
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,439
Yes.

180
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,692
Then I'll leave the rest to you.

181
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,328
What's this?

182
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,607
A copy of the list of ANBU members
under the direct command of the Hokage?

183
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,134
<i>It looks like the real thing.</i>

184
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,542
This is the place, huh...?

185
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:58,225
The entrance is straight ahead
beneath that rocky area.

186
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,647
All right! Let's go!

187
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:06,483
Just a minute.

188
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,959
Go after you swallow this,
Naruto.

189
00:17:25,722 --> 00:17:27,265
Here. You, too, Sakura.

190
00:17:28,346 --> 00:17:30,223
Now even if we get separated,

191
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:33,343
I'll know where you guys are
right away.

192
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,885
What is this?

193
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,109
To put it simply, this seed
is a tracking transmitter.

194
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:47,546
It's a ninja tool that resonates
only with my chakra.

195
00:17:49,397 --> 00:17:52,650
It's the same thing I placed
in Sai's clothing and food.

196
00:17:53,368 --> 00:17:56,121
I get it. That's how you were able
to track him this far.

197
00:17:56,506 --> 00:17:59,342
When did you do that,
Captain Yamato?

198
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:03,469
Do you remember when
I got out of the hot spring first?

199
00:18:04,815 --> 00:18:06,024
Come to think of it...

200
00:18:06,915 --> 00:18:11,362
Now you know why I went to the
trouble of letting you guys enjoy...

201
00:18:11,387 --> 00:18:15,474
the hot springs and magnificent food
at my expense, right?

202
00:18:16,256 --> 00:18:19,301
It wasn't just
to improve our rapport, huh?

203
00:18:21,528 --> 00:18:23,238
And Lady Tsunade told me...

204
00:18:23,263 --> 00:18:26,058
to take particular caution
regarding Sai.

205
00:18:26,395 --> 00:18:29,398
But never mind that.
Swallow that quickly.

206
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:31,893
Got it!

207
00:18:38,354 --> 00:18:41,066
All right!
Let's get going, you two.

208
00:18:41,783 --> 00:18:42,590
- Okay!
- Right!

209
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,790
The formation for infiltration will be
in the following order:

210
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,583
me, Sakura, and Naruto.

211
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:48,836
How will we infiltrate?

212
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,130
We'll go by the book...

213
00:18:51,324 --> 00:18:53,285
and infiltrate from underground
using Earth Style.

214
00:18:54,113 --> 00:18:56,783
First, we'll open up
a pit in this area.

215
00:18:57,313 --> 00:18:59,315
And then, once we've made
a degree of progress digging...

216
00:18:59,462 --> 00:19:02,465
we'll move forward little by little
by digging a tunnel...

217
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,450
heading for that rocky area
where the entrance is.

218
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:05,429
Right!

219
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,855
Okay, understood.

220
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,983
Okay, let's begin.

221
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,113
<i>We finally did it...</i>

222
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:19,908
<i>We found you.</i>

223
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,208
Okay, come on inside...

224
00:19:39,557 --> 00:19:41,267
This is your room.

225
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:45,267
Sorry about this place being
so dull with nothing in it.

226
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:47,968
The bathroom is in the back.

227
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,016
When you don't have
anything to do...

228
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,876
stay in here nice and quiet.

229
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,742
We'll let you know from our end
if something comes up.

230
00:20:06,244 --> 00:20:10,039
Sorry, but I'll be locking the door
from the outside for now.

231
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:14,463
After all, you're...
You know, right?

232
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,021
It appears the hideout...

233
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,773
is surrounded by rocks,
just as I thought...

234
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:37,819
I'll smash this thing right away!
With my Rasengan!

235
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,046
Just a minute!

236
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:44,201
They'll spot us immediately if you use
a powerful jutsu like that!

237
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,163
Infiltration must be done
quietly all the way...

238
00:20:48,367 --> 00:20:49,952
But how do we do that...?

239
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:54,554
Here it is!

240
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,134
The harder the rock...

241
00:21:02,952 --> 00:21:07,790
by applying just a little force
to a small crack...

242
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,653
Look, just like this.

243
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,206
Well, that's a successful infiltration,
more or less.

244
00:21:33,266 --> 00:21:34,643
First, we need to find Sai.

245
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,591
This way.

246
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,122
Clear. Let's go.

247
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:21,089
Now then, if I don't get right
to making the Bingo Book...

248
00:22:21,454 --> 00:22:23,623
Lord Orochimaru will scold me again.

249
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,732
We're almost there...

250
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,623
I knew you'd be here.

251
00:23:00,575 --> 00:23:02,035
I'd expect no less from
the ANBU Black Ops...

252
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,562
under the direct command
of the Hokage.

253
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,595
Now tell us everything.
What's this about?

254
00:23:09,146 --> 00:23:12,441
You jerk!
Why did you betray us?!

255
00:23:13,816 --> 00:23:16,069
You shouldn't make too much
of a commotion here.

256
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,605
That would become troublesome, you see.

257
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,234
- You jerk!
- Naruto!

258
00:23:29,788 --> 00:23:31,373
Here... take this.

259
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,165
It's yours, isn't it?

260
00:23:39,975 --> 00:23:40,802
Thank you.

261
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:44,172
It was an order
from Danzo, right?

262
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,343
Danzo has teamed up
with Orochimaru...

263
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,554
What are they planning?

264
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,017
With Orochimaru, he's planning to...

265
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,020
once again destroy the Leaf Village...

266
00:24:00,058 --> 00:24:01,059
Isn't that right?

267
00:24:03,667 --> 00:24:04,835
No, that's not—

268
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,529
I can tell right away that
your smile is a lie!

269
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:11,283
And I can tell right away that
what you're saying is a lie!

270
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:19,875
Now that you have found me...

271
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,086
my mission is considered
a failure.

272
00:24:23,257 --> 00:24:27,011
I can't handle all of you by myself.

273
00:24:27,612 --> 00:24:30,198
And... if you know that much...

274
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,971
then there's no point
in hiding anything.

275
00:24:37,447 --> 00:24:38,614
You're exactly right.

276
00:24:39,422 --> 00:24:41,465
We're going to crush
the current Leaf Village.

277
00:24:41,917 --> 00:24:43,043
Say what...?!

278
00:24:43,665 --> 00:24:46,960
The real mission I was given was
to gain the favor of Orochimaru...

279
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,946
and create an opportunity for
a collaboration...

280
00:24:50,464 --> 00:24:52,967
in order to crush the Leaf Village.

281
00:24:53,938 --> 00:24:55,648
I also have the duty
of secretly sending...

282
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,330
information about Orochimaru
to Lord Danzo...

283
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,876
In other words, I have also been
entrusted with a mission as a spy.

284
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,378
You've been given such
a dangerous mission...

285
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,299
Orochimaru will definitely betray us...

286
00:25:09,514 --> 00:25:12,428
once the Leaf Village
has been crushed.

287
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:17,516
It's to make sure we've always
got the advantage.

288
00:25:18,132 --> 00:25:21,386
Danzo wants to make
the Leaf Village his own, huh?

289
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,690
You made preparations
for that all by yourself...

290
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:30,570
The information I wrote
in black ink

291
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:34,032
transforms into small animals...

292
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:39,996
and carries the information out
while protecting itself, you see.

293
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,334
This ability of mine
was valued highly...

294
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:47,254
and so I was selected
for this mission.

295
00:25:47,435 --> 00:25:48,811
Many people will die, once again...

296
00:25:48,836 --> 00:25:50,421
if things become turbulent
in the Leaf Village!

297
00:25:51,035 --> 00:25:54,747
Do you even know why
you're doing this?!

298
00:25:56,675 --> 00:25:58,886
No idea...
They're my orders, so...

299
00:26:00,984 --> 00:26:02,778
Sai, you...

300
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,771
Let me tell you
one more thing...

301
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,734
Sai is the name I was given
just for this mission...

302
00:26:09,979 --> 00:26:11,481
I'm nobody.

303
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:15,031
I am a tool for Lord Danzo.

304
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,534
I don't exist.

305
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,746
So no matter what you say
to me, it's pointless.

306
00:26:26,492 --> 00:26:27,702
Then why...

307
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,774
do you hold on to
that picture book with such care?!

308
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,394
The two kids on the cover...

309
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:47,105
are you and
your older brother, right?

310
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,234
You're holding on to
that picture book with such care...

311
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:55,864
because it's the only thing
that proves your existence, isn't it?

312
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:01,536
You haven't been able to discard
your emotions as completely as you say.

313
00:27:04,153 --> 00:27:07,573
Even shinobi can't completely
discard their emotions.

314
00:27:09,535 --> 00:27:10,870
As proof of that...

315
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,381
when I handed
the picture book to you earlier...

316
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:17,427
You said thanks and took it.

317
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:23,975
Why does having this picture book
prove my own existence?

318
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,780
The reason why you don't want
to part with that book...

319
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:32,317
is that you can't forsake yourself
as a younger brother...

320
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,487
Do you know why?

321
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,353
It's because your bonds with
your older brother...

322
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:43,085
were that important to you!

323
00:27:46,022 --> 00:27:49,526
You don't want to erase the bonds
you have with your older brother...

324
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:59,636
Sorry, but we had a look
inside the picture book.

325
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,935
Only the picture in
the center-facing pages is unfinished.

326
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:13,775
Sai, I also know that you're from
the Foundation.

327
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:18,113
And I also know that
you received special training...

328
00:28:18,138 --> 00:28:20,349
from Danzo in order
to suppress your emotions.

329
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:22,766
Special training...?

330
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,664
It's the same as the evil practice...

331
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:31,501
once conducted in the Village Hidden in the Mist,
also known as the "Village of the Bloody Mist,"

332
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,086
in order to take away emotions.

333
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,880
Looking at the flow
of the picture book,

334
00:28:36,644 --> 00:28:39,150
it appears you're
defeating enemies...

335
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:42,887
and taking away
their weapons and armor...

336
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,606
On the facing pages at the center...

337
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:56,396
you will end up fighting
your older brother...

338
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,605
You killed your older brother—

339
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:00,631
No!

340
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:04,659
I was planning on
giving this to him.

341
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:10,123
But when I was just about finished
with the picture book, he...

342
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,086
died from sickness.

343
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:21,192
In the Foundation, there were
many children of broken families...

344
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:22,635
brought about by battle.

345
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:24,679
He was one of those children.

346
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:28,016
I became close with him,
like a brother.

347
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,480
We weren't related by blood...

348
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,357
But he often said nice things
about my drawings.

349
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,527
In this picture book...

350
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:42,030
what I wanted to show him
most of all...

351
00:29:42,537 --> 00:29:45,540
was what were supposed to be the final
pictures on the facing pages.

352
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,286
But after he died...

353
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:52,624
I couldn't remember
what I was going to draw.

354
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:16,856
Unfortunately Sai...

355
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:21,319
I'll be having my clone
stand guard over you here.

356
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,090
All right!

357
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:27,826
Now it's back to square one...

358
00:30:29,318 --> 00:30:31,028
We're going to save Sasuke!

359
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,457
I wouldn't bother.

360
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:39,045
I...

361
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:41,965
met Sasuke.

362
00:30:46,932 --> 00:30:50,310
Sasuke always has Orochimaru
with him.

363
00:30:50,693 --> 00:30:53,446
You'll just be chopped into pieces...

364
00:30:53,471 --> 00:30:55,598
and used as a test subject
if you pursue him recklessly.

365
00:30:56,659 --> 00:30:57,660
And...

366
00:30:58,332 --> 00:31:00,042
And what?!

367
00:31:02,668 --> 00:31:06,339
Sasuke said he doesn't care
about you...

368
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:12,579
Sakura said you think of Sasuke like
a brother.

369
00:31:13,453 --> 00:31:14,662
And yet...

370
00:31:20,192 --> 00:31:22,736
For a guy like that, why...?

371
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:27,719
Why? When nobody is ordering you to?

372
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:36,978
I used to really hate Sasuke.

373
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,399
Even though, like me,
he didn't have a family...

374
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:45,236
he was elite and
I was always at the bottom.

375
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:50,033
But it was actually fun
being with him.

376
00:31:51,215 --> 00:31:52,216
He...

377
00:31:54,721 --> 00:31:57,265
He's the person
who acknowledged me...

378
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,125
more than anyone else.

379
00:32:14,403 --> 00:32:15,571
Sasuke...

380
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,894
is my friend.

381
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,523
It's a special bond
I was finally able to make.

382
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:25,360
A bond.

383
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:28,947
Even so...

384
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,158
Even so, with Orochimaru
as your opponent...

385
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:35,495
It doesn't matter who the opponent is!

386
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:40,375
If my arms get torn off,
I'll kick him to death.

387
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,462
If my legs get torn off,
I'll bite him to death.

388
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,675
If my head gets torn off,
I'll stare him to death.

389
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:53,096
If my eyes get gouged out,
I'll curse him from the grave!

390
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,064
Even if I get chopped up
into pieces...

391
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:08,653
I'll take Sasuke back
from Orochimaru!

392
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,158
We'll go after
I create the guard.

393
00:33:27,451 --> 00:33:31,121
I thought we'd completely
given our pursuers the slip...

394
00:33:32,804 --> 00:33:34,181
I guess I should say...

395
00:33:34,206 --> 00:33:38,752
I'd expect no less from one of
Lord Orochimaru's test subjects...

396
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,688
Kabuto...!

397
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:47,859
Sai...

398
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:53,322
Judging from your condition,
it appears you've been captured.

399
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:57,160
Don't interfere.

400
00:33:58,157 --> 00:33:59,992
If you do...

401
00:34:00,225 --> 00:34:01,697
I won't hold back!

402
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:14,761
It's futile.

403
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:18,890
We won't know that until we try!

404
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,103
You've got it wrong.

405
00:34:35,082 --> 00:34:37,209
I'm not talking about that.

406
00:35:10,581 --> 00:35:13,125
Ah! That was impressive...

407
00:35:21,574 --> 00:35:24,827
<i>I guess with three against one,
the odds are against me, huh?</i>

408
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:31,879
I'll trust you... since it seems
you haven't betrayed us.

409
00:35:35,991 --> 00:35:40,162
Seriously, watching you is just pathetic.

410
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,266
You in particular, Naruto.

411
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,643
Watching you...

412
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:53,109
What I'm saying is, it's futile
even if you beat me.

413
00:35:54,465 --> 00:35:55,758
People change...

414
00:35:59,971 --> 00:36:06,018
Sasuke isn't the same person he was.

415
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:17,592
Wha—?!

416
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:23,973
People change...

417
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,769
Then the same goes for me.

418
00:36:30,183 --> 00:36:31,184
What?!

419
00:36:32,235 --> 00:36:35,071
But there are things
that don't change...

420
00:36:35,682 --> 00:36:38,143
Sai... You...

421
00:36:43,587 --> 00:36:44,588
Bonds...

422
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,959
I want to see for myself...

423
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:55,880
Sai...

424
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,341
Hold him down.

425
00:37:14,033 --> 00:37:15,326
What's so funny?!

426
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:21,697
You guys don't know
the real Sasuke...

427
00:37:25,464 --> 00:37:27,549
He's probably done
with his training right about now...

428
00:37:27,574 --> 00:37:29,576
and is in a room deeper
inside the hideout.

429
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,417
Where exactly is this room...?

430
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,087
I don't know, either.

431
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,633
There are several rooms
scattered about in here.

432
00:37:41,735 --> 00:37:44,654
The inner part of the hideout
isn't just one or two rooms.

433
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:46,430
In that case!

434
00:37:47,404 --> 00:37:49,698
We just have to search
every single one of them!

435
00:37:52,016 --> 00:37:53,100
You're right.

436
00:37:54,296 --> 00:37:57,050
You might find it
if you search at random.

437
00:37:58,389 --> 00:37:59,556
However...

438
00:38:00,824 --> 00:38:03,744
That's also where Lord Orochimaru's
private chambers are.

439
00:38:06,897 --> 00:38:08,982
Thanks for speaking honestly.

440
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:12,832
No need to thank me.

441
00:38:13,998 --> 00:38:17,418
Are you saying you'll turn
the tables on us?

442
00:38:18,868 --> 00:38:19,589
Yeah.

443
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:21,232
You jerk!

444
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:25,428
That's something we won't know
until we try.

445
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:27,763
Let's go.

446
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,854
We won't know
until we try... huh?

447
00:38:40,635 --> 00:38:43,597
Truly... pathetic...

448
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:57,376
Now we're going to split up
and search for Sasuke.

449
00:38:58,377 --> 00:38:59,471
Sakura and I on one team.

450
00:39:00,127 --> 00:39:01,664
Naruto and Sai on the other.

451
00:39:01,689 --> 00:39:03,900
If something comes up,
build up your chakra.

452
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:06,177
It'll be the signal for me
to rush over immediately.

453
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:16,937
<i>Sasuke...</i>

454
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,482
All right!

455
00:39:20,007 --> 00:39:21,008
Let's go!

456
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:37,249
<i>For me, you've become...</i>

457
00:39:41,101 --> 00:39:42,686
<i>my closest friend.</i>

458
00:39:47,379 --> 00:39:48,505
<i>Sasuke...!</i>

459
00:39:57,853 --> 00:39:58,854
<i>Sakura...</i>

460
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,486
<i>Thanks...</i>

461
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:11,617
<i>Sasuke...</i>

462
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:17,998
Naruto!

463
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:19,750
Right!

464
00:40:38,031 --> 00:40:39,032
This isn't the place.

465
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,067
Not here, either!

466
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,196
He's not here, either.

467
00:40:51,284 --> 00:40:52,327
He's not here!

468
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:53,909
He's not here.

469
00:40:55,869 --> 00:40:56,870
Damn it!

470
00:41:05,372 --> 00:41:06,415
<i>Sasuke...</i>

471
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,299
<i>Where are you?!</i>

472
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:12,928
<i>Where are you?!</i>

473
00:41:14,945 --> 00:41:18,991
<i>We've... finally made it this far!</i>

474
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:21,376
<i>Where are you?!</i>

475
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:24,773
<i>Sasuke...!</i>

476
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,458
Sasuke!

477
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:04,813
Naruto...!

478
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:09,818
We're split up
into two search teams.

479
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,655
You should stay calm
and rest a little...

480
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,406
Shut up...!

481
00:42:15,321 --> 00:42:17,740
I can't be resting!

482
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:21,789
We're so close... to Sasuke...

483
00:42:27,861 --> 00:42:29,028
<i>Damn it...!</i>

484
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:32,383
<i>The damage I took from using the
Nine-Tails' power still hasn't...</i>

485
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,648
It seems you're awake...

486
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,945
Boy... you really resemble him.

487
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:56,907
My older brother...

488
00:42:59,586 --> 00:43:01,838
He was talkative and hot-headed...

489
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,873
He had no manners...
and his equipment was—

490
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,251
Well, never mind...

491
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,732
But yeah... like you,

492
00:43:11,343 --> 00:43:14,300
he put his all into everything he did.

493
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:17,886
When I look at you,

494
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,890
I kind of remember him...

495
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:27,563
What's the matter?

496
00:43:33,292 --> 00:43:36,212
I remembered... I remembered!

497
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:39,492
You mean...

498
00:43:51,361 --> 00:43:53,405
This is what I wanted
to show him.

499
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:56,592
The picture of our dreams...

500
00:44:02,495 --> 00:44:04,414
Now then... Sai...

501
00:44:04,848 --> 00:44:08,060
whose side will you take?

502
00:44:12,085 --> 00:44:14,087
<i>Striking Shadow Snake!</i>

503
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,746
Just as I thought. It seems
you're taking that side, huh...?

504
00:44:22,214 --> 00:44:23,590
Sai or whatever...

505
00:44:24,482 --> 00:44:26,651
I'll stop him here.

506
00:44:27,925 --> 00:44:30,553
Sai, you go find Sasuke.

507
00:44:33,355 --> 00:44:34,356
Hurry!

508
00:44:34,803 --> 00:44:39,683
Okay... I'll find Sasuke...
and save him!

509
00:44:48,932 --> 00:44:52,519
So you came to take back
Sasuke, huh...?

510
00:44:53,225 --> 00:44:58,271
Your persistence is impressive,
but will it really be that easy?

511
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:02,700
It doesn't make any difference that
you're one of the Legendary Sannin

512
00:45:02,725 --> 00:45:04,852
like Pervy Sage and Lady Tsunade!

513
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:09,524
I'll defeat you...
and take Sasuke back!

514
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:13,783
He's not here, either...

515
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:19,133
It appears something
has happened...

516
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:20,509
Let's go!

517
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:21,677

What happened to all
your energy from earlier?

Your power...
The power of the Nine-Tails...

522
00:46:06,164 --> 00:46:08,541
There must be more to it
than this, right?

523
00:46:10,507 --> 00:46:13,259

530
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:11,495
Wh-What?!

531
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:16,166
More importantly,
I've got business with Sai...

532
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,752
So I'll be leaving now.

533
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:22,798
Where's Sai?

534
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:25,342
Sai's looking for Sasuke!

535
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:29,179
We have to do something
before Orochimaru finds him!

536
00:47:42,391 --> 00:47:44,351
I'll have to use up all of
my chakra,

537
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:47,138
but I'll try searching with
my Multi-Shadow Clone...

538
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:50,075
Captain Yamato and Sakura,
you guys search that side.

539
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:00,260
What's this...?

540
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:04,715
He... was able to remember...

541
00:48:05,762 --> 00:48:07,806
They're both smiling...

542
00:48:08,646 --> 00:48:13,442
Yeah... He truly smiled for
the first time when he drew that.

543
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:15,809
Smiled from the bottom of his heart.

544
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:22,107
Wh-What's this...?!

545
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:31,873
It was in Sai's bag...

546
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:35,454
This is an assassination list
that has...

547
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:38,441
an ANBU member's assigned targets
recorded...

548
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,001
It's called a Bingo Book.

549
00:48:43,297 --> 00:48:45,550
Why does Sai have such a thing...?

550
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,094
Look at this...

551
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:05,233
I get it...
So that's what this is about?

552
00:49:05,936 --> 00:49:07,563
What do you mean?!

553
00:49:08,138 --> 00:49:09,139
Sai...

554
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:14,743
His mission wasn't to act as a liaison
between Orochimaru and Danzo.

555
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:29,883
Sai's true classified mission...

556
00:49:34,372 --> 00:49:36,207
was to assassinate Sasuke.

557
00:49:42,652 --> 00:49:45,154
That could never be!

558
00:49:45,712 --> 00:49:48,363
Unlike before, he's now...

559
00:49:48,388 --> 00:49:49,681
What if that was all...

560
00:49:50,592 --> 00:49:53,929
an act in order
to forestall you, Naruto?

561
00:49:54,513 --> 00:49:55,973
The owner of this Bingo Book...

562
00:49:55,998 --> 00:49:58,375
could indeed be capable
of something like that.

563
00:49:59,547 --> 00:50:00,548
Look at this...

564
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:06,126
This man in the book
next to Sasuke...

565
00:50:06,389 --> 00:50:08,057
He's a Jonin from the Hidden Mist...

566
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:11,341
and a man who took a hard-line
stance against the Leaf.

567
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:14,583
Sai... defeated him, huh...?

568
00:50:16,753 --> 00:50:19,380
He couldn't have been
an easy opponent to defeat...

569
00:50:19,993 --> 00:50:22,704
It's quite clear by looking
at each of the people listed...

570
00:50:22,729 --> 00:50:24,397
in this Bingo Book...

571
00:50:25,631 --> 00:50:29,302
Sai was tasked with eliminating those
who posed a threat to the Leaf.

572
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:35,211
And Sasuke is also
one such dangerous person.

573
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,627
Danzo's goal...

574
00:50:47,874 --> 00:50:52,515
was to eliminate Orochimaru's next
vessel... to eliminate Sasuke.

575
00:50:53,728 --> 00:50:55,104
In order to do that,

576
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:57,791
Sai attempted
to approach Orochimaru...

577
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:03,685
He didn't betray the Leaf.
It was for the sake of the Leaf.

578
00:51:07,368 --> 00:51:10,246
That's exactly the kind of plan someone from
a hard-line military faction would devise.

579
00:51:11,242 --> 00:51:14,537
There's no point in going on
about that here...

580
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:20,332
I felt Sai's chakra earlier.
We need to go quickly.

581
00:51:22,103 --> 00:51:23,104
Who's there?

582
00:51:25,633 --> 00:51:27,135
So, you found me.

583
00:51:27,809 --> 00:51:31,688
But... I've already made
the first move.

584
00:51:33,407 --> 00:51:34,742
What is your objective?

585
00:51:37,264 --> 00:51:41,352
Lord Danzo's objective is
to bury you...

586
00:51:45,658 --> 00:51:47,493
I'm going to...

587
00:51:49,432 --> 00:51:51,017
... take you back to the Leaf!

588
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:54,319
Although at the beginning,

589
00:51:54,858 --> 00:51:57,069
I came here with the intention
of killing you...

590
00:51:58,829 --> 00:52:03,334
<i>He's the person who acknowledged me
more than anyone else.</i>

591
00:52:03,943 --> 00:52:07,599
I want to protect his bond with you,

592
00:52:08,303 --> 00:52:12,251
the one he's so desperately trying
to protect.

593
00:52:14,395 --> 00:52:15,247
Bond...

594
00:52:18,164 --> 00:52:22,418
You interrupted my sleep
for something like that...?

595
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,274
What was that...?

596
00:52:33,211 --> 00:52:34,629
<i>Sasuke, huh...?</i>

597
00:52:35,384 --> 00:52:38,971
<i>That kid wakes up in
a bad mood, you see...</i>

598
00:52:48,484 --> 00:52:49,986
Impressive...

599
00:52:51,349 --> 00:52:54,477
To think he'd break free
from my jutsu by force...

600
00:53:13,907 --> 00:53:15,117
<i>I found him!</i>

601
00:53:16,162 --> 00:53:17,163
Sakura!

602
00:53:22,294 --> 00:53:23,962
You!
What are you really after?!

603
00:53:24,307 --> 00:53:25,719
How many times do you have
to betray us until you're satisfied...?

604
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:26,745
Sakura, huh?

605
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:42,709
Sa... su... ke...

606
00:54:06,641 --> 00:54:07,642
Sasuke...

607
00:54:21,363 --> 00:54:22,364
Naruto, huh...?

608
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:25,095
So even you were here, huh?

609
00:54:30,366 --> 00:54:32,827
Then is Kakashi also with you?

610
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:38,441
Sorry, it's not Kakashi...
I'm his substitute.

611
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:43,196
Team Kakashi will now be taking you
back to the Leaf.

612
00:54:46,792 --> 00:54:48,085
Team Kakashi, huh?

613
00:54:55,118 --> 00:54:56,828
Sai! I knew it!

614
00:54:58,287 --> 00:55:00,161
So he's my replacement, huh...?

615
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:04,426
So they've brought another
soft-hearted one into the mix.

616
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:07,262
He said he wanted to protect
the bond...

617
00:55:07,287 --> 00:55:08,913
between Naruto and me, but...

618
00:55:12,022 --> 00:55:14,612
Sai... I thought your mission
was to kill Sasuke.

619
00:55:14,637 --> 00:55:18,474
My classified mission was indeed
the assassination of Sasuke...

620
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,401
But I've had enough of orders...

621
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,529
I now want to act on my own beliefs.

622
00:55:25,483 --> 00:55:28,645
I think Naruto will get me to remember...

623
00:55:29,613 --> 00:55:31,114
my past emotions.

624
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:33,705
I kind of get the feeling...

625
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:35,999
it's something very important to me.

626
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,960
I don't know you very well.

627
00:55:40,054 --> 00:55:42,765
But there must be some kind
of reason why Naruto and Sakura...

628
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:44,750
have pursued you so desperately.

629
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:47,510
They don't want to sever
their bonds with you...

630
00:55:47,972 --> 00:55:50,432
They're giving it their all
to secure those bonds.

631
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,846
I still don't understand it
all that clearly...

632
00:55:56,438 --> 00:55:59,984
But Sasuke...
you should understand.

633
00:56:02,344 --> 00:56:05,181
Yeah... I did understand.

634
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:10,325
That's why I severed the bonds.

635
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:16,498
I have different bonds...

636
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:23,046
Bonds of hatred with
my older brother...

637
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:26,431
Numerous bonds...

638
00:56:28,743 --> 00:56:30,454
mislead you...

639
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:34,140
and weaken the most important desires...

640
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:38,311
and cherished memories.

641
00:56:42,375 --> 00:56:44,877
If that's the case, then why...?

642
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:50,907
Why didn't you kill me
back then?!

643
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:55,662
You think that could
break our bond, Sasuke?!

644
00:56:57,288 --> 00:56:58,832
The reason's simple...

645
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:04,087
It's not that I couldn't break
the bond with you...

646
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:06,348
<i>You're one...</i>

647
00:57:06,373 --> 00:57:10,377
<i>who might be able to use the same
Mangekyo Sharingan as mine...</i>

648
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:15,432
<i>However, there's a condition.</i>

649
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:19,060
<i>You must kill...</i>

650
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:21,604
<i>your closest friend.</i>

651
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:26,234
<i>That's...!</i>

652
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:30,071
The thought of it was just irritating
to me.

653
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:34,492
Obtaining power based on
the method he told me.

654
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:39,414
What do you mean?!

655
00:57:40,098 --> 00:57:42,643
It's not necessary
to explain that to you.

656
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:46,671
What I can say to you is...

657
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:56,097
Back then...

658
00:57:57,015 --> 00:58:02,729
You're only alive
because of my passing whim.

659
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:23,917
<i>He's fast!</i>

660
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:26,085
<i>When did he...?</i>

661
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:29,047
Come to think of it,

662
00:58:29,307 --> 00:58:32,313
wasn't it your dream
to become the Hokage...?

663
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:36,095
If you had the time
to be chasing after me,

664
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:38,223
you should have spent that time training.

665
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:42,060
Right, Naruto?

666
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,229
And so this time around...

667
00:58:44,616 --> 00:58:46,743
you'll lose your life...

668
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:51,361
because of my passing whim.

669
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:01,746
No way can a guy who can't
even save one friend...

670
00:59:02,057 --> 00:59:03,767
become the Hokage.

671
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:15,343
That manner of defense...

672
00:59:16,484 --> 00:59:17,946
was correct.

673
00:59:23,476 --> 00:59:24,477
All right!

674
00:59:27,963 --> 00:59:29,214
<i>Chidori Stream!</i>

675
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:49,085
<i>He's unleashing Chidori
from his entire body...!</i>

676
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:56,926
<i>I'll stop Sasuke...</i>

677
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:01,556
<i>with my own power!</i>

678
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:11,649
<i>Those eyes.
This guy's bad news.</i>

679
01:00:20,323 --> 01:00:21,991
That manner of defense...

680
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:24,454
was a mistake.

681
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:28,583
This snake sword of mine
is somewhat special, you see.

682
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:31,878
It's impossible to guard.

683
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,547
<i>My body is getting numb...</i>

684
01:00:36,113 --> 01:00:37,114
<i>This is...</i>

685
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,011
<i>Is he sending a Chidori
through the blade...?</i>

686
01:00:41,061 --> 01:00:46,900
<i>I get it... It paralyzes you
with numbness after cutting...</i>

687
01:00:47,773 --> 01:00:51,235
<i>while also increasing its
cutting power to the extreme.</i>

688
01:01:30,485 --> 01:01:34,531
<i>Now's your chance, Naruto...</i>

689
01:01:36,473 --> 01:01:41,312
<i>Show him... our...</i>

690
01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:43,792
<i>powers.</i>

691
01:01:48,035 --> 01:01:49,453
<i>What's the matter...?</i>

692
01:01:56,388 --> 01:01:59,350
<i>Why do you hesitate...?</i>

693
01:02:02,131 --> 01:02:05,801
<i>You need my power, don't you?</i>

694
01:02:11,432 --> 01:02:12,766
<i>Now then...</i>

695
01:02:16,484 --> 01:02:18,903
<i>Who do you want to kill...?</i>

696
01:02:22,086 --> 01:02:26,006
Don't... come out anymore!

697
01:02:28,137 --> 01:02:30,389
<i>What are you afraid of?</i>

698
01:02:30,772 --> 01:02:31,982
Shut up...!

699
01:02:32,685 --> 01:02:36,772
I don't need anything like
your power anymore!

700
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:52,310
<i>Who was the one
who had the nerve...</i>

701
01:02:52,335 --> 01:02:56,131
<i>to ask for my help
at every opportunity?</i>

702
01:03:00,113 --> 01:03:06,828
<i>You should know that you can't
do anything on your own.</i>

703
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:11,287
<i>Break the seal completely!</i>

704
01:03:11,568 --> 01:03:16,531
<i>I'll grant you all of my powers
if you do.</i>

705
01:03:19,194 --> 01:03:20,237
Get lost!

706
01:03:23,195 --> 01:03:24,447
<i>You...</i>

707
01:03:32,138 --> 01:03:35,900
<i>I see...
So you're an Uchiha...</i>

708
01:03:36,996 --> 01:03:40,542
<i>My, how you've grown...</i>

709
01:03:42,273 --> 01:03:44,400
What are you doing here...?

710
01:03:44,703 --> 01:03:46,246
I can see it now...

711
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:49,584
So this is your true power?

712
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:51,953
Who would've thought...

713
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:55,581
you'd have something like this
inside of you...

714
01:03:56,730 --> 01:04:01,818
<i>To think you'd become able
to see me within Naruto...</i>

715
01:04:02,674 --> 01:04:05,574
<i>That dreadful Sharingan...</i>

716
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:09,728
<i>So that's the power of
the cursed clan, huh?</i>

717
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:13,683
It seems this isn't the first time
you've seen the Sharingan.

718
01:04:14,263 --> 01:04:15,306
Then...

719
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:18,354
you must be
the Nine-Tailed Fox, huh...?

720
01:04:19,483 --> 01:04:24,530
<i>That vision and chakra
more ominous than mine...</i>

721
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:29,032
<i>It's just like Madara Uchiha's
from back then...</i>

722
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:30,575
<i>Uchiha...</i>

723
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:40,078
I don't know anyone by that name.

724
01:04:41,794 --> 01:04:43,671
<i>I never thought...</i>

725
01:04:43,696 --> 01:04:46,866
<i>you would go so far as
to suppress my power...</i>

726
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:53,335
<i>This might be the end...</i>

727
01:04:53,851 --> 01:04:56,604
<i>But let me tell you... one thing...</i>

728
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:03,608
<i>Don't... kill... Naruto...</i>

729
01:05:06,087 --> 01:05:08,006
<i>You'll...</i>

730
01:05:08,464 --> 01:05:11,052
<i>regret... it...</i>

731
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:32,943
<i>Wood Style: Domed Wall!</i>

732
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:03,626
Why...?

733
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:10,591
Why don't you get it?!

734
01:06:12,259 --> 01:06:16,847
Soon, Orochimaru's going
to take your body!

735
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:22,853
If it happens, it happens...

736
01:06:26,219 --> 01:06:29,306
You're still a kid, Naruto.

737
01:06:30,515 --> 01:06:33,936
Revenge is everything to me.

738
01:06:34,828 --> 01:06:36,842
If I can carry out my revenge,

739
01:06:36,867 --> 01:06:40,371
I don't care what happens to me,

740
01:06:40,396 --> 01:06:41,522
or to this world.

741
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:49,839
Put simply, neither I nor Orochimaru
can defeat Itachi right now.

742
01:06:50,589 --> 01:06:55,094
But if I can obtain the power
to accomplish that

743
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:59,390
by giving my body to Orochimaru,

744
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:02,727
then I'll give him as much of
this life of mine as he wants.

745
01:07:13,779 --> 01:07:14,905
The talking's over.

746
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:19,493
Naruto and Sakura...

747
01:07:20,661 --> 01:07:24,290
I didn't want to get rough
in front of you two...

748
01:07:25,082 --> 01:07:27,710
but I'm going to get serious now.

749
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,378
Captain Yamato!

750
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:31,464
What do you mean, serious...?

751
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:35,718
I can't just let those

752
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:39,430
who abandoned the village just like
Orochimaru run loose.

753
01:07:40,518 --> 01:07:44,146
So I'll do whatever I have to do
to haul Sasuke back to the Hidden Leaf.

754
01:07:46,629 --> 01:07:47,672
The Hidden Leaf, huh...?

755
01:07:49,049 --> 01:07:50,592
I've had enough of you guys...

756
01:07:57,114 --> 01:08:00,993
Don't bother with that jutsu, Sasuke.

757
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,079
Let go of me...

758
01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:05,706
Hey-hey...

759
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:11,754
Don't talk to
Lord Orochimaru like that...

760
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,507
I've got no reason to stop.

761
01:08:15,575 --> 01:08:18,703
You know what the Akatsuki
are up to, don't you?

762
01:08:21,496 --> 01:08:23,456
We want these guys from
the Hidden Leaf

763
01:08:23,481 --> 01:08:26,025
to take care of the Akatsuki for us.

764
01:08:27,726 --> 01:08:28,978
As many of them as possible...

765
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:34,318
Your revenge won't turn out well

766
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,821
if the other Akatsuki
get in the way, right?

767
01:08:38,397 --> 01:08:40,148
That's a pathetic reason.

768
01:08:41,325 --> 01:08:45,287
It should increase your chances of
revenge, even by a single percent.

769
01:08:46,604 --> 01:08:47,605
Isn't that right?

770
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:58,843
Let's go.

771
01:09:50,394 --> 01:09:51,395
<i>Once again...</i>

772
01:09:52,571 --> 01:09:55,365
<i>Once again... I couldn't stop him...</i>

773
01:09:58,136 --> 01:10:02,474
<i>I'm... so pathetic...</i>

774
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:31,781
Crying...

775
01:10:33,849 --> 01:10:37,144
Crying won't bring Sasuke back home!

776
01:10:43,106 --> 01:10:47,444
I'm here! I'll get stronger with you!

777
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:58,968
We've got...
close to six months left, right?

778
01:11:00,299 --> 01:11:03,594
And three of us are better than two,
right?

779
01:11:05,188 --> 01:11:07,691
Besides, I'm pretty strong myself.

780
01:11:22,464 --> 01:11:23,465
Thanks...

781
01:13:07,299 --> 01:13:08,300
What did you say?!

782
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:10,219
Naruto and the others fought Sasuke?!

783
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:11,637
Yes...

784
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:14,431
So... then what happened?

785
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:20,396
I see...

786
01:13:39,456 --> 01:13:41,959
I never thought you'd fail
the special mission...

787
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:44,628
That's very unlike you...

788
01:13:47,548 --> 01:13:49,675
I have a favor to ask.

789
01:13:50,008 --> 01:13:52,094
A favor, you say?

790
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:53,137
Yes.

791
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:58,016
Could you keep me in Team Kakashi
under this name for a while?

792
01:14:04,603 --> 01:14:06,730
<i>That smile on his face...</i>

793
01:14:08,652 --> 01:14:11,780
I've already taken that up
with Tsunade.

794
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:17,828
But you understand, don't you, Sai?
Emotions create hatred.

795
01:14:17,828 --> 01:14:21,707
And hate creates battles.

796
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:27,045
<i>That might be so.</i>

797
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:29,882
<i>But...</i>

798
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:34,887
<i>He's the person who acknowledged
me more than anyone else.</i>

799
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:39,099
<i>It's a special bond
I was finally able to make.</i>

800
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:19,515
Hey! Sai!

801
01:15:28,504 --> 01:15:31,174
We're having a meeting about
our next mission!

802
01:15:47,084 --> 01:15:48,710
Hurry up!

803
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:50,671
Right, I'm coming.
