1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,546
I'm just going out for a delivery.

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,424
Whoa! Outta the way!

3
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:15,056
Sorry, mister!

4
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,058
Hey, Naruto!

5
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,021
No, I mean...

6
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,273
Konohamaru!

7
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,552
Hey... Could that be...?

8
00:00:52,889 --> 00:00:54,891
Yeah... No doubt about it.

9
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,833
Hey. Sakura!

10
00:01:03,002 --> 00:01:04,461
Oh, Konohamaru!

11
00:01:04,544 --> 00:01:06,004
Where are you off to?

12
00:01:06,298 --> 00:01:07,800
The main village gate.

13
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:12,072
I have to pick up the morning gate log
for Lady Tsunade.

14
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:13,698
You want to come?

15
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,910
It's been about two and a half years.

16
00:01:17,104 --> 00:01:18,981
Yeah, it has...

17
00:01:20,745 --> 00:01:24,123
And then that cat, Tora, suddenly
starts scratching me like crazy!

18
00:01:24,803 --> 00:01:28,435
We had missions like that, too.
It kind of takes me back.

19
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:30,045
Come to think of it,

20
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,572
have you heard anything
from Naruto?!

21
00:01:32,845 --> 00:01:35,055
Nothing... yet.

22
00:01:35,432 --> 00:01:36,516
I see...

23
00:01:37,907 --> 00:01:40,535
He should be coming back soon, though...

24
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:48,132
Hello, Izumo, Kotetsu.

25
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,896
Oh, look who's here...

26
00:01:50,843 --> 00:01:52,553
Why don't you head on into town?

27
00:01:52,601 --> 00:01:54,562
You'll see something interesting.

28
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,377
Something interesting...?

29
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,744
Don't tell me!

30
00:02:06,604 --> 00:02:08,314
He's having a ball...

31
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:13,671
This takes me back!
The village hasn't changed a bit!

32
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:20,756
Everyone! Naruto Uzumaki's back!

33
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,653
It's all so nostalgic...!

34
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,321
Yup! Yup!

35
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:04,327
They added Grandma Tsunade
to the Hokage Rock!

36
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:08,373
Naruto? Is that you, Naruto?

37
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,835
When did you get back, Naruto?!

38
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,255
Just now!

39
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,009
Long time no see, Sakura!

40
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,560
You've gotten taller than me,
haven't you?

41
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:30,770
Huh...?

42
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,939
Oh! You're right.

43
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,152
<i>He kind of... got
taller since I saw him last...</i>

44
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:43,366
So? Do you think I seem
a little more feminine?

45
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,703
You're fine!
You haven't changed a bit.

46
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:55,128
<i>You just don't understand
the heart of a woman...</i>

47
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,504
Naruto!

48
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,427
<i>Sexy Jutsu!</i>

49
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,720
Ohh!

50
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,096
Wha--?!

51
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:10,643
How about that?!
Check out these curves, right?!

52
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:19,235
Konohamaru...
I'm not a kid anymore.

53
00:05:19,828 --> 00:05:23,624
And you shouldn't be using jutsu
like that anymore, either.

54
00:05:25,084 --> 00:05:29,421
<i>That's right. It isn't just
your appearance that's matured...</i>

55
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,708
<i>I kind of feel a bit lonesome,</i>

56
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:36,210
<i>but you've turned out quite admirable,
haven't you, Naruto?</i>

57
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:39,199
That's such a boring jutsu!

58
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:43,760
Check out my new and improved Sexy Jutsu!

59
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,220
<i>Right...
The new and improved Sexy Jutsu...</i>

60
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,889
Here we go!

61
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,100
Hey, you idiot!

62
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,490
You haven't changed at all,
have you, you jerk?!

63
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,617
After not seeing you for two and a half years!

64
00:06:07,642 --> 00:06:09,770
You pull this stunt less than two minutes
after we meet!

65
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,830
- <i>That short temper and incredible strength.</i>
- So much for feeling sentimental!

66
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,458
- <i>She's a second-generation Tsunade.</i>
- Huh? Honestly, I'm mad at myself!

67
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:18,614
It's been a long time, you two.

68
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:21,716
I'm sure your training produced
good results, right?

69
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,740
Do you think we came back
without making progress?

70
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,712
It went perfectly!

71
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,308
Then show me those
results immediately.

72
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:32,726
Show you...?

73
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:34,978
You two will be facing a certain man.

74
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,356
I didn't send him on any missions
for the past several days

75
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,066
and had him on standby for this very purpose.

76
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,071
Hello.

77
00:06:48,344 --> 00:06:51,755
Shikamaru! Temari!
Look who's here!

78
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,498
Naruto.

79
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:58,043
Hey! That is you isn't it, Naruto!

80
00:06:58,951 --> 00:06:59,952
Shikamaru!

81
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,797
<i>This is... that little shrimp...?</i>

82
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:05,469
So you're back?

83
00:07:05,494 --> 00:07:07,412
Yeah, I got back this morning.

84
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,051
You don't look as dumb as you used to.

85
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:14,434
I mean, hey, have you changed?

86
00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:19,022
No, he hasn't.

87
00:07:19,047 --> 00:07:20,590
Oh... I thought so.

88
00:07:20,867 --> 00:07:22,451
Sakura.

89
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:27,188
Then, does this mean
you're my opponent, Shikamaru?

90
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,824
Opponent? What do you mean?

91
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,494
I just came to deliver
some documents.

92
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,871
Huh? So you're not my opponent?

93
00:07:35,034 --> 00:07:36,119
Then...?

94
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,073
Who are you again?

95
00:07:39,198 --> 00:07:40,575
You don't remember me?

96
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,588
Naruto, that's not your opponent.

97
00:07:44,636 --> 00:07:45,679
He's out there.

98
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,349
You sure got tall... Naruto.

99
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:57,227
Yo!

100
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,051
Kakashi-sensei!

101
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,816
Sensei, you haven't changed one bit!

102
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:08,321
Listen, listen...
I've got a present for you, Sensei.

103
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,282
What?!

104
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,536
You got me... Th-This is...

105
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:20,746
This is the first new book in the
Make-Out series in three years!

106
00:08:20,771 --> 00:08:22,105
I think it's totally boring,

107
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,423
but you like this stuff,
don't you, Sensei?!

108
00:08:29,827 --> 00:08:34,123
<i>That idiot... No way could
a kid understand the appeal.</i>

109
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,807
<i>And on top of that,</i>

110
00:08:35,832 --> 00:08:37,667
<i>it's a very rare item that hasn't
even been released yet...</i>

111
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:41,187
All right! That's enough fun
for now, Kakashi.

112
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,944
Don't tell me...
Are you my opponent...?

113
00:08:48,224 --> 00:08:51,268
Hmm, not quite...

114
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:59,414
Naruto... and Sakura,
the both of you!

115
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,460
Kakashi-sensei's our opponent...

116
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,796
I want to see what you
can do against Kakashi...

117
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:10,884
Your future duties will be determined
by the results.

118
00:09:12,422 --> 00:09:13,674
Future duties...?

119
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,764
Sakura, show me that

120
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,349
you weren't just wasting
your time training under me.

121
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:19,993
Yes, ma'am!

122
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,020
Then, shall we get right to it?

123
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,024
That's what I'd like to say.

124
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,902
But since you just got back, Naruto,
you must be tired.

125
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,820
I'll give you a short rest.

126
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:34,074
I'm not particularly tired
or anything!

127
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,118
Let's meet up at
the Third Training Grounds later.

128
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:38,828
See ya.

129
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:43,041
Why's he in such a hurry?

130
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,337
I have a pretty good idea...

131
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,339
He's going to read his book.

132
00:09:49,564 --> 00:09:50,356
Oh!

133
00:09:50,431 --> 00:09:53,309
With that look he had,
there's no doubt about it.

134
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,637
<i>That's the obvious reaction</i>

135
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,765
<i>after getting an unreleased copy
of one of my books.</i>

136
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:04,813
Oh man, I thought you'd be
a little impressed.

137
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,359
Well, my training involved
way more awesome jutsu.

138
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,736
Just as I anticipated from you!

139
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,030
It's all going according to plan!

140
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,073
Plan?

141
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,666
What happened here?!

142
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:28,461
As you can see, I cleaned
your house until it sparkled.

143
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,964
Konohamaru,
you're such a great guy!

144
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,842
Yup! And I don't even
expect you to teach me

145
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,301
a new jutsu in return either!

146
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,512
I have absolutely
no ulterior motives!

147
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,142
You are so obvious.

148
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,603
All right then. I'm going to
teach you an amazing jutsu.

149
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,188
All right!

150
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,732
First, let me put my things away.

151
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,194
Isn't that the outfit
you used to wear?

152
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,488
Yeah, it doesn't fit anymore.

153
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,533
But I just can't part with it...

154
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:07,625
What I'm going to teach you
isn't your run-of-the-mill jutsu.

155
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,503
<i>Just what kind of pervy ninjutsu
is it going to be?</i>

156
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,298
Just hurry up and show me!

157
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,216
The first step is rotation.

158
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:19,387
Whoa! We're going to
add motion, eh?!

159
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,140
Next up is power.

160
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:25,768
Attack with the risqué, eh?!

161
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:29,272
And then finally, there's...

162
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:33,234
There's more!

163
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,485
Containment!

164
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:37,989
The most points go to
the best-expressed final pose, eh?!

165
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,117
What are you talking about?

166
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,287
I mean,
it's a pervy ninjutsu, right?

167
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,581
It's more awesome than that.

168
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:50,335
The jutsu I'm about to teach you is A-rank
in its degree of difficulty to master.

169
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,840
An ultimate ninjutsu that hones

170
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,718
chakra rotation,
power and contained...

171
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,929
It's called the Rasengan!

172
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,354
Awesome!

173
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:13,274
But I don't understand
what's going on at all!

174
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:19,322
Don't worry about that,
because I'm going to teach you.

175
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:22,283
Besides, you can do this jutsu
even if you're stupid!

176
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:23,576
No kidding!

177
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,912
Huh? Stupid?

178
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:29,874
This training consists
of three steps, total.

179
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,627
First step, the water balloon.

180
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,212
A water balloon?

181
00:12:35,097 --> 00:12:37,850
You have to GAAAH it,
then BAM it, to burst it!

182
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,218
Wow!

183
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,470
So... How did you do that?!

184
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,305
I just explained it.

185
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:48,184
You have to GAAAH it,
then BAM it, to burst it!

186
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:51,938
I said...

187
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:54,440
You have to GAAAH it, then BAM it!

188
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:55,817
Simple, right?!

189
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,572
Okay, do your best, Konohamaru.

190
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,242
What? That's it?

191
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,703
You're already leaving?!

192
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,622
I have to train with Sakura now.

193
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:10,915
But!

194
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,002
Don't be a baby, Konohamaru.

195
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,464
In anything you do, you've got to
learn by doing and feeling.

196
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:26,014
Besides... I have absolute faith...
that you can do it!

197
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,141
Naruto...

198
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:32,937
All right...

199
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,106
I'm going to do it!

200
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,860
I'm going to surprise you
the next time you see me!

201
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,664
Is Kakashi-sensei
going to make us wait forever?!

202
00:13:53,895 --> 00:13:55,980
Well, he's always been like this.

203
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:00,548
Honestly... It'd be nice if he'd show
a little improvement.

204
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,011
Oh, sorry about that.

205
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,638
As it happens, I ran into an old woman
in trouble on my way here and...

206
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,349
- Okay! That's a lie!
- Okay! That's a lie!

207
00:14:16,346 --> 00:14:19,140
This place...
kind of takes me back.

208
00:14:24,737 --> 00:14:26,287
Oh, come to think of it,

209
00:14:26,312 --> 00:14:29,565
this was your first Training Ground,
wasn't it?

210
00:14:31,556 --> 00:14:32,849
Team 7...

211
00:14:34,513 --> 00:14:36,098
The three-man cell...?

212
00:14:38,453 --> 00:14:41,706
We had Sasuke with us...
back then, didn't we?

213
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:54,678
<i>Sasuke's name is
off limits for these guys...</i>

214
00:15:01,288 --> 00:15:04,124
Well... Let's see how much
you've grown.

215
00:15:04,648 --> 00:15:06,901
You haven't given up
on Sasuke, have you?

216
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,533
Absolutely not!

217
00:15:08,558 --> 00:15:11,353
That's why I continued my training!

218
00:15:14,335 --> 00:15:17,463
The rules are the same
as when we first met.

219
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:21,469
I don't care how you do it.
Just take a bell away from me.

220
00:15:23,227 --> 00:15:25,479
- If you don't...
- "come at me with the intent to kill,"

221
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:28,132
"we won't be able to get the bells", right?

222
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,472
Exactly.

223
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,184
If you don't come at me with the intent to
kill, you won't be able to get the bells.

224
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,603
You have until sunrise tomorrow.

225
00:15:45,493 --> 00:15:47,537
Now then, shall we begin?

226
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,366
You're not going to do it

227
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:53,619
while reading your book
this time around, Kakashi-sensei?

228
00:15:53,762 --> 00:15:56,765
Or have you already
finished reading?

229
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,678
Nope... I thought I'd save
the fun for later...

230
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,296
Besides...

231
00:16:03,321 --> 00:16:05,949
Well, I kind of get the feeling...

232
00:16:06,186 --> 00:16:07,730
I may have to...

233
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:12,889
get a bit serious this time around.

234
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:20,938
Let's go!

235
00:16:26,707 --> 00:16:28,125
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

236
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,118
<i>Transform!</i>

237
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:48,424
<i>His timing for using
the Shadow Clone Jutsu has gotten better.</i>

238
00:16:51,273 --> 00:16:53,108
<i>You've grown, haven't you, Naruto?</i>

239
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,389
<i>However...</i>

240
00:16:55,598 --> 00:17:00,144
Well, it seems you're just
as impatient as ever.

241
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,065
I haven't even said start yet,
have I?

242
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:10,420
<i>Don't be so hasty.
I haven't even said start yet, have I?</i>

243
00:17:11,862 --> 00:17:13,364
Now then, let's begin.

244
00:17:19,368 --> 00:17:21,662
Ready... start!

245
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,212
Damn it!

246
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:28,214
I've been had!

247
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,383
Come on, Naruto, you goof!

248
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:35,054
<i>Right? Above? Left?</i>

249
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,306
<i>Behind?</i>

250
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,809
<i>If he's in none of those places...</i>

251
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:43,070
He must be below!

252
00:17:47,207 --> 00:17:48,043
Huh?

253
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:53,155
<i>Wh-What ridiculous strength.</i>

254
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,074
<i>Fifth Hokage...</i>

255
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:58,828
<i>You didn't just teach Sakura
medical ninjutsu, huh?</i>

256
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,371
Kakashi-sensei.

257
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,414
Huh?

258
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,748
I found you.

259
00:18:05,082 --> 00:18:09,628
<i>I'd... I'd better stop acting like
an idiot in front of Sakura.</i>

260
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,382
<i>I'll get killed...!</i>

261
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:16,570
<i>She built up her maximum
chakra inside her body at once</i>

262
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,931
<i>and instantly concentrated
all of it into her fist.</i>

263
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,519
<i>That's a feat that can't be done
without considerable chakra control.</i>

264
00:18:24,453 --> 00:18:26,956
<i>Medical ninjutsu along
with superhuman strength...</i>

265
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:29,609
<i>No. It's more than that.</i>

266
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,612
<i>Sakura's originally a genjutsu-type,
after all.</i>

267
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:36,907
<i>She might just become
a better kunoichi than the Fifth Hokage.</i>

268
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,747
<i>All right, now I guess
it's my turn, huh?</i>

269
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,441
<i>This is totally different from
back then.</i>

270
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,341
You're wide open!

271
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,554
<i>If I can hit him once...</i>

272
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,559
<i>It won't mean a thing
if you don't hit me.</i>

273
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:53,109
Phew, that was a close one.

274
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,319
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

275
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,030
Here I come!

276
00:19:59,301 --> 00:20:00,886
All right, bring it on.

277
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,622
The bell's mine.

278
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:12,920
You won't get away!

279
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,258
Dancing Leaf Shadow...?!

280
00:20:36,196 --> 00:20:38,907
Now... where's the real one?

281
00:20:39,231 --> 00:20:40,881
Right here.

282
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,618
<i>Secret Finger Jutsu:</i>

283
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,664
<i>A Thousand Years of Death!</i>

284
00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:54,343
Damn it. I missed!

285
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:59,800
That was a close one...
In a different sense.

286
00:21:15,202 --> 00:21:17,621
<i>It used to be so easy.</i>

287
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:23,449
Over there?!

288
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:30,657
<i>This one is?!</i>

289
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,336
<i>A transformation of one
of Naruto's Shadow Clones, huh?!</i>

290
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,885
<i>I'm finished if it even grazes me...</i>

291
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,325
<i>The speed of his seal forming...</i>

292
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,118
<i>It's way too fast!</i>

293
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:13,628
<i>Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!</i>

294
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,099
Where's Kakashi-sensei?

295
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,187
<i>Earth Style: Headhunter Jutsu!</i>

296
00:22:43,992 --> 00:22:45,076
<i>A Shadow Clone, huh?!</i>

297
00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:55,271
<i>Water Style: Water Dragon Missile!</i>

298
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,215
What?!

299
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,364
I always knew, but...

300
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,249
The Sharingan is really
something else, isn't it?

301
00:23:30,515 --> 00:23:31,516
Yeah...

302
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:35,581
But even more than that,
the speed of his seal formation...

303
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:38,000
It's so fast it's tough for us
to even get near him...

304
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,182
For the time being, we won't
have a prayer of getting the bells

305
00:23:41,207 --> 00:23:43,064
unless we can do something
about both his hands.

306
00:23:43,196 --> 00:23:48,451
Yeah. That Kakashi-sensei's
incredibly strong for sure.

307
00:23:50,378 --> 00:23:52,088
He's smarter than Shikamaru.

308
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,143
He has a better sense of smell
than Kiba.

309
00:23:57,013 --> 00:23:58,681
His Sharingan is better
than Sasuke's.

310
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,232
His taijutsu is better than
Bushy Brow's.

311
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,815
And he's got way more...
experience than us...

312
00:24:07,027 --> 00:24:10,447
But even Kakashi-sensei must
have a weakness!

313
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,660
If we think hard about it...

314
00:24:14,229 --> 00:24:16,731
Hmm. A weakness, huh...?

315
00:24:19,672 --> 00:24:22,216
Oh! He does...
have a weakness?!

316
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:23,337
What?!

317
00:24:25,167 --> 00:24:30,072
You should be able to figure it out if
you look back on his actions up until now.

318
00:24:30,564 --> 00:24:35,110
Quit stalling already...
What's his weakness, Naruto?

319
00:24:37,336 --> 00:24:38,714
Well, you see...

320
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,026
I get it!

321
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:49,154
I never thought he'd have
a weakness like that.

322
00:24:49,576 --> 00:24:53,371
See?! It's clear if you think back
on his actions up until now, right?

323
00:24:54,546 --> 00:24:55,797
Right, right.

324
00:24:56,049 --> 00:24:57,842
In addition to occupying
both his hands,

325
00:24:58,125 --> 00:25:00,544
we might be able to seal off
his Sharingan if things go well.

326
00:25:00,633 --> 00:25:02,718
And then if we seize the opportunity...

327
00:25:02,806 --> 00:25:03,849
Naruto...

328
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:07,060
Sure enough, you're the number one
unpredictable ninja!

329
00:25:09,471 --> 00:25:12,140
<i>Still, I was so pleased with
how much they've grown</i>

330
00:25:12,449 --> 00:25:14,284
<i>that I ended up getting
kind of carried away...</i>

331
00:25:14,923 --> 00:25:18,677
<i>I guess this time I'll wait and see
what kind of move they'll make.</i>

332
00:25:19,583 --> 00:25:22,085
Now that that's settled,
the first strike will decide this!

333
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:24,398
We'll make the first move!

334
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:26,293
Right! Let's go!

335
00:25:30,687 --> 00:25:31,688
<i>They're here.</i>

336
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,576
You're underestimating me.

337
00:25:36,056 --> 00:25:38,350
To think you'd attack me
head-on like that.

338
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,459
Now, Naruto!

339
00:25:43,484 --> 00:25:45,444
Here we go, Kakashi-sensei!

340
00:25:46,855 --> 00:25:50,108
At the end of "Make-Out Tactics...!"

341
00:25:50,308 --> 00:25:52,894
Wh-What?!

342
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:56,055
As it happens, the main character...!

343
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,766
<i>He's giving away the ending!
N-No!</i>

344
00:26:03,803 --> 00:26:06,097
<i>Oh, no! I still understand
what he's saying.</i>

345
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,734
<i>I can read his lips with my Sharingan.</i>

346
00:26:22,637 --> 00:26:23,638
Oh!

347
00:26:25,747 --> 00:26:28,000
A ninja must see underneath the underneath.

348
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,786
Right, Sensei?!

349
00:26:31,349 --> 00:26:32,434
You got me...

350
00:26:36,113 --> 00:26:39,157
I should've just gone ahead
and finished the book...

351
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:45,104
But how can you even
read such a boring book?!

352
00:26:45,383 --> 00:26:46,193
Huh?

353
00:26:46,554 --> 00:26:49,140
The Pervy Sage loaned it to me,

354
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:52,569
but it was so boring
I didn't even make it ten pages.

355
00:26:53,283 --> 00:26:55,619
So of course, I don't know
how the book ends.

356
00:27:00,935 --> 00:27:03,312
Even without Naruto knowing
the ending of the book...

357
00:27:03,337 --> 00:27:06,561
we figured you'd respond
if we mentioned the name,

358
00:27:06,586 --> 00:27:08,421
"Make-Out Tactics."

359
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:10,645
Pretty good strategy, huh?

360
00:27:13,453 --> 00:27:16,247
You two certainly showed me
some growth.

361
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:21,723
Master!

362
00:27:21,798 --> 00:27:24,175
Kakashi, do you have
something to say?

363
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:29,189
Well, they did a great job
taking the bells away from me, so...

364
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,691
Yes.

365
00:27:33,528 --> 00:27:35,238
What are you talking about?

366
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:38,855
We're talking about
your status for the future.

367
00:27:39,963 --> 00:27:41,840
Our status...?

368
00:27:42,192 --> 00:27:43,943
- Naruto Uzumaki!
- Huh?

369
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,205
Answer me.

370
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:46,540
Y-Yeah!

371
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:47,958
Sakura Haruno!

372
00:27:47,983 --> 00:27:48,984
Yes!

373
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,506
The two of you and...

374
00:27:54,979 --> 00:27:56,592
Kakashi Hatake...

375
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,521
The three of you shall
form Team Kakashi!

376
00:28:02,015 --> 00:28:02,975
Team Kakashi...

377
00:28:03,096 --> 00:28:07,601
W-Wait, what does that mean?

378
00:28:07,942 --> 00:28:12,941
The two of you will form a team with
me and we'll carry out missions together.

379
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:16,653
That's what this means.

380
00:28:17,241 --> 00:28:18,450
It's not like the old days.

381
00:28:18,491 --> 00:28:20,409
We're no longer teacher and students.

382
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:25,162
We'll work together as fellow Leaf shinobi.
Got it?

383
00:28:26,868 --> 00:28:29,287
Sure! I got it!

384
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:37,382
Gee, you guys sure got strong.

385
00:28:37,803 --> 00:28:40,806
I never thought you'd really
be able to get the bells...

386
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:44,448
I just might've surpassed you,
Kakashi-sensei.

387
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:46,767
Don't get so cocky!

388
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:52,314
Well, but I'm still pretty young,
you see...

389
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:57,110
The other day, I developed
an incredible new jutsu...

390
00:28:57,464 --> 00:28:59,674
And it's pretty incredible, you see...

391
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,240
Oh, that's right.

392
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:04,743
I haven't had any Ichiraku ramen
since I got back!

393
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:06,578
Oh, I'm also pretty hungry

394
00:29:06,603 --> 00:29:09,848
from all that training exercise
since yesterday.

395
00:29:10,099 --> 00:29:12,434
All right! Let's make a beeline
for Ichiraku Ramen!

396
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,460
Right!

397
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:22,719
<i>They used to be so cute
and react to everything back in the day...</i>

398
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:31,144
As promised,
I leave Naruto in your care.

399
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,981
It's my first Ichiraku ramen in ages!

400
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,649
It'll be Kakashi-sensei's treat!

401
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,693
- Treat! Treat!
- Treat! Treat!

402
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:41,947
The actions of the Akatsuki
are gaining momentum...

403
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,076
I'm heading off to gather information.

404
00:29:50,506 --> 00:29:51,507
See you around.

405
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,875
Kakashi-sensei!

406
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,043
Huh?

407
00:29:55,618 --> 00:29:59,748
It's been settled that you're
going to treat us to some ramen!

408
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,675
Hurry up!

409
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,468
Sorry, guys!

410
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:09,224
I have to go file the formation papers
for our new team!

411
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:10,851
See you.

412
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,144
I'm off.

413
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,688
Oh! He ran away!

414
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,316
He said something about a unit list...

415
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:20,402
but he's probably just wondering
what happens next in... his book...

416
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:22,487
That means...

417
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,534
Then how about we go
on a date, just the two of us?

418
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:29,619
That's fine. But you're treating.

419
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:30,620
Oh...

420
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,712
You could at least pay
for half of the ramen...

421
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:39,671
No way!

422
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:45,177
Yeah. Ichiraku hasn't changed a bit!

423
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:50,140
Mm... This aroma...
It's whetting my appetite.

424
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:52,768
All right!

425
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,313
Hiya!

426
00:30:57,077 --> 00:30:58,204
Welcome!

427
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:02,986
Old man... Do you remember me?

428
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:04,821
Naruto...

429
00:31:05,171 --> 00:31:06,589
It's you, isn't it, Naruto?!

430
00:31:07,605 --> 00:31:09,315
No way could I forget you!

431
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:10,494
Long time no see!

432
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,038
Huh? Naruto?

433
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:14,456
You sure got big!

434
00:31:14,597 --> 00:31:16,390
Long time no see, miss!

435
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,769
What'll you have?
You're hungry, right?

436
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:21,088
Yeah, I'm starved!

437
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:24,007
All right then, today it's on me.

438
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:25,675
Order whatever you like!

439
00:31:26,021 --> 00:31:27,064
All right!

440
00:31:27,121 --> 00:31:28,122
No...

441
00:31:28,481 --> 00:31:30,608
It's on me today.

442
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,851
I knew you'd be here, Naruto!

443
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,269
Iruka-sensei!

444
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:39,365
Sakura isn't with you?

445
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:47,697
If I'd known you were going to treat,
I'd have brought Sakura, too...

446
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:52,244
Here's an extra-large special serving
of our ramen!

447
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:57,541
It's the real-deal Ichiraku ramen...

448
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:04,197
I dreamed about this ramen
so many times during my training...

449
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:06,716
Now, eat up before it gets cold!

450
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:07,884
Right.

451
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,430
Thank you!

452
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,775
<i>- Naruto...
- Huh?</i>

453
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,361
<i>You've sure grown
a lot compared to the time</i>

454
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:28,613
<i>when you wanted this...</i>

455
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,741
<i>Have I?! Have I?!
Do you think so?</i>

456
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,744
<i>This headband you gave me,</i>

457
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,289
<i>it looks perfect on me now, doesn't it?</i>

458
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:44,087
<i>Don't be getting carried away!
You've still got a long way to go.</i>

459
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:46,465
<i>You've still got to do better and better!</i>

460
00:32:48,393 --> 00:32:50,694
<i>You've gotten so big...</i>

461
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:54,473
Man, this is good!

462
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:58,351
Sure enough, Ichiraku Ramen
is the greatest!

463
00:33:00,328 --> 00:33:01,830
Isn't it, though?

464
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:07,627
I... thought the next time Iruka-sensei
would treat me to ramen

465
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:10,063
would be after I'd become a Chunin...

466
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:12,532
Naruto...

467
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,660
You don't need to worry about
whether you're a Genin or a Chunin.

468
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:19,998
After all, Master Jiraiya
trained you personally...

469
00:33:20,023 --> 00:33:21,608
I know, but...

470
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:25,962
But listen, that Pervy Sage
is really merciless!

471
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:32,719
The cloth on the precious headband
you gave me got all tattered.

472
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:34,763
The same with my clothes, too.

473
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:37,599
So I had a new cloth made for it
along with my new clothes!

474
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:42,896
But thanks to that intense training,
you've gotten quite strong, haven't you?

475
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,940
You should be happy about it.

476
00:33:44,998 --> 00:33:47,167
Yeah. I feel like I've gotten
another step closer

477
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:49,361
to becoming the Hokage!

478
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,447
Ooh, sounds like you've got
quite the confidence!

479
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,660
That Kakashi-sensei.

480
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,662
Is that stupid book
more important to him

481
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:01,331
than the results of our training?

482
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:06,002
So, are you guys on a date?

483
00:34:06,351 --> 00:34:08,116
It's not like that.

484
00:34:08,648 --> 00:34:10,900
Heh! Cut out the jokes.

485
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,551
Why would I be on
a date with this guy?

486
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:14,928
It's almost time for the Chunin Exam.

487
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,681
I've just been going back and forth
between the Sand and the Leaf

488
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,474
for meetings concerning the Exams.

489
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:21,851
And although it's a pain,

490
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,979
I've been put in charge
of the Exams...

491
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:27,722
I've just been told to act as
a guide for the Sand messenger.

492
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:30,944
Chunin Exam, huh...?

493
00:34:31,579 --> 00:34:33,206
That sure takes me back...

494
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,031
Oh...

495
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:37,368
So what are you going to do, Naruto?

496
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,743
About what?

497
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:41,788
About the Chunin Exam.

498
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:46,876
You're the only one from our class
who hasn't become a Chunin.

499
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,468
What?!

500
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,555
Th-Then, you're a Chunin too, Sakura?

501
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:00,640
Heh-heh... That's right.

502
00:35:01,045 --> 00:35:05,591
And just for the record,
Kankuro, this person here,

503
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:09,274
and Neji, who's a year above us,
are all already Jonin.

504
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:10,817
Huh?!

505
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,945
Then what about Gaara?!

506
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:28,710
Lord Kazekage...

507
00:35:28,997 --> 00:35:30,332
The meeting is about to begin.

508
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:37,844
Okay.

509
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:50,857
What do you think?!
Pretty good, huh...?

510
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,402
It is my finest work.

511
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,075
Over the past several years,

512
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:02,243
the strength of our village
has stabilized,

513
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:06,998
and our relations with the Hidden Villages
in our allied nations have prospered.

514
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:10,085
In particular,
we have achieved good results

515
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:13,463
in our development of recruits
with the curriculum incorporating...

516
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,382
the training program
from the Leaf Village.

517
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:20,470
The Chunin Exam is almost here.
I look forward to the results.

518
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:24,307
However... at this time,
with the Chunin Exam upon us,

519
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:25,892
there is a nasty rumor
going around...

520
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:27,852
What is it, Yura?

521
00:36:28,861 --> 00:36:32,948
Have you heard of the organization
called the "Akatsuki"?

522
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:40,415
Why have they started taking
such dramatic action?

523
00:36:41,011 --> 00:36:42,179
What's their goal?

524
00:36:42,327 --> 00:36:46,247
That's beyond me at this point...
What I do know...

525
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:53,837
is that they're after what's inside Naruto.

526
00:36:54,194 --> 00:36:58,949
And... that they have something evil
in mind.

527
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:01,611
I passed on this information

528
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,638
to those in charge of security
for each land.

529
00:37:03,783 --> 00:37:07,662
I sure hope they tighten up
their security immediately.

530
00:37:10,818 --> 00:37:14,822
I see... I'd heard the rumors...

531
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,694
So the organization in question
is finally taking action...

532
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,781
The source of the information
is Lord Jiraiya,

533
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,324
one of the legendary Sannin.

534
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,243
So prior to the meeting,

535
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:28,747
I took the liberty of issuing an order
to increase Village security.

536
00:37:29,403 --> 00:37:33,585
Elite ANBU Black Ops have already been
stationed at key points around the village.

537
00:37:34,272 --> 00:37:36,608
No matter how powerful
the shinobi may be,

538
00:37:36,636 --> 00:37:39,097
they will not be able
to infiltrate by force.

539
00:37:40,354 --> 00:37:42,940
I hear the members of the Akatsuki
wear black clothing

540
00:37:42,965 --> 00:37:46,010
in addition to capes with
a red cloud pattern on them.

541
00:37:47,089 --> 00:37:49,091
I ordered security to attack
with full force

542
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,557
if they encounter anyone
matching that description.

543
00:37:55,179 --> 00:37:57,973
Now then...
the meeting is adjourned.

544
00:38:04,311 --> 00:38:06,256
Well done, Yura.

545
00:38:06,502 --> 00:38:08,629
I never thought you'd take action
so quickly.

546
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:13,409
I have served on the council for four years.

547
00:38:14,049 --> 00:38:15,467
It is my intention...

548
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,379
to always make decisions
while considering...

549
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:23,438
what's in the best interest...
of the... village.

550
00:38:34,976 --> 00:38:35,935
What's the matter?

551
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,399
Nothing... It's nothing at all...

552
00:38:39,219 --> 00:38:40,679
I just haven't slept much...

553
00:38:41,101 --> 00:38:43,979
I see... You need to take care
of yourself.

554
00:38:44,095 --> 00:38:45,542
Thank you for your concern.

555
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,372
<i>I see... That's right...</i>

556
00:39:04,986 --> 00:39:06,059
I see.

557
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:10,073
So we have to deal with this one, then go
after the guy we sent to Orochimaru, huh?

558
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:15,520
It seems he turned traitor
and leaked information about us.

559
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,169
It can't be helped.

560
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:22,235
Even I don't know what happens
after the jutsu is cast.

561
00:39:22,846 --> 00:39:25,891
More importantly,
will just that bag be enough?

562
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,398
Our opponent is the Jinchuriki.

563
00:39:31,172 --> 00:39:33,716
All of my jutsu are works of art.

564
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:37,758
And I made sure to
bring my specialty.

565
00:39:41,509 --> 00:39:45,013
After all, our opponent
is the One-Tail.

566
00:40:02,263 --> 00:40:04,849
Black clothing and
a red cloud pattern.

567
00:40:05,207 --> 00:40:06,291
Don't tell me...

568
00:40:06,811 --> 00:40:07,812
Is that...?

569
00:40:08,097 --> 00:40:10,266
Contact Captain Yura immediately!

570
00:40:11,441 --> 00:40:12,484
Captain Yura!

571
00:40:12,509 --> 00:40:14,803
Members of that organization have shown up.

572
00:40:14,828 --> 00:40:16,079
I know.

573
00:40:16,965 --> 00:40:19,760
You don't need to worry...
It'll be over soon.

574
00:40:44,814 --> 00:40:49,235
Good work...
Do you remember me?

575
00:40:51,435 --> 00:40:53,687
Of course, I do, Lord Sasori.

576
00:40:54,169 --> 00:40:55,754
Of course, he does.

577
00:40:55,779 --> 00:40:58,490
It wouldn't be much of
a jutsu if he didn't.

578
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:04,832
They become loyal subordinates
after regaining their memory.

579
00:41:37,085 --> 00:41:38,670
I say it's about ready?

580
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,624
All right, it's done...

581
00:41:45,499 --> 00:41:48,210
My man Sasori, you watch from here.

582
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:49,465
Okay.

583
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,231
I'll attack the village...

584
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:08,568
from above.

585
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:13,072
What do you think of
this artistic form...?

586
00:42:14,585 --> 00:42:18,047
Don't make me wait too long, Deidara!

587
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:40,892
One.

588
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:44,645
Two.

589
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:49,331
Three.

590
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:52,028
So there are three people
guarding the skies...

591
00:42:56,801 --> 00:43:01,263
Still, this village sure has
quite the artistic design to it.

592
00:43:02,229 --> 00:43:04,940
It's certainly worth destroying, though...

593
00:43:07,714 --> 00:43:09,465
From here on, I'll have to be stealthy.

594
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:49,168
Wh-What's this strange thing?!

595
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:53,798
It's not strange, you know.

596
00:43:58,141 --> 00:44:01,978
As expected, philistines just don't
understand art.

597
00:44:04,235 --> 00:44:05,820
I'll show you with your own bodies.

598
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:09,105
True art... is an explosion!

599
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,034
Infiltration successful.

600
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:31,919
That's as far as you go.

601
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:28,017
You're pretty good.

602
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:46,035
<i>Now that's a handy Jinchuriki.</i>

603
00:45:49,466 --> 00:45:52,261
But... how'd you know
I was the intruder?

604
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:57,505
There are no birds like that
in this desert.

605
00:45:58,047 --> 00:45:59,298
I see.

606
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:02,927
What do you mean something strange
got into the village?!

607
00:46:03,224 --> 00:46:06,811
Captain Yura was supposed to have
tightened village security.

608
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:11,560
Actually... we have been unable to
contact Captain Yura.

609
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:14,146
Come again?!

610
00:46:15,893 --> 00:46:18,103
So much for the stealthy approach.

611
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:24,139
But now...

612
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:27,660
I don't have to bother...
looking for you anymore...!

613
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,976
He's got the advantage,
as expected...

614
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,020
This is a real mess.

615
00:47:05,698 --> 00:47:06,699
Gaara...

616
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:47,156
<i>He uses strange explosives...
And he's able to guide them, huh?</i>

617
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:54,872
All right.

618
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,341
They're fast, this time.

619
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:20,773
Gaara!

620
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:41,461
<i>It's just like an eggshell
protecting what's inside.</i>

621
00:48:46,489 --> 00:48:51,470
<i>But it's incredible that he was able
to block the explosion completely.</i>

622
00:49:00,168 --> 00:49:01,503
<i>Sand Prison!</i>

623
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:03,482
This is not good.

624
00:49:51,969 --> 00:49:53,596
This sand's such
a pain in the neck.

625
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:02,351
Kankuro!

626
00:50:04,685 --> 00:50:07,855
Is Gaara fighting right now?!
Where is he?

627
00:50:08,214 --> 00:50:09,215
Yeah.

628
00:50:09,634 --> 00:50:10,635
He's up there...

629
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:35,157
<i>Sand Coffin...</i>

630
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:49,296
Not bad.

631
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:52,007
<i>I get it.</i>

632
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,343
<i>The sand he used to crush
my hand</i>

633
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:56,762
<i>is much faster and more powerful</i>

634
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:58,872
<i>than ordinary sand taken
from the desert...</i>

635
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:07,565
I remember now!

636
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:13,404
<i>That's the "Ultimate Defense" sand...</i>

637
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:17,575
<i>In other words,</i>

638
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:23,122
<i>the sand from that hole is
what crushed my arm...</i>

639
00:51:28,377 --> 00:51:30,671
<i>I've only got a little bit
of clay left...</i>

640
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:36,468
<i>I underestimated him...</i>

641
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:38,867
<i>What you'd call
"not prepared enough."</i>

642
00:51:39,722 --> 00:51:42,180
This is just as my man Sasori said...

643
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:45,728
I've only enough left for
one more homing-type...

644
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:48,856
<i>and my specialty as well.</i>

645
00:51:57,865 --> 00:51:59,074
I think...

646
00:52:00,259 --> 00:52:01,843
I'll destroy this village, after all.

647
00:52:09,418 --> 00:52:11,003
Lord Kazekage...

648
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:18,802
Black clothing and
a red cloud pattern...!

649
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:20,888
Judging from that appearance,

650
00:52:21,387 --> 00:52:25,516
The Kazekage is likely fighting
a member of the Akatsuki.

651
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:27,019
I knew it.

652
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:30,939
Kankuro.

653
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:32,483
What is it?

654
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,319
For the time being,

655
00:52:35,441 --> 00:52:37,943
we need to consider that
Gaara could lose control.

656
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:41,700
We need to be ready
in case Shukaku appears.

657
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:44,536
The villagers will be in danger.

658
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:48,248
That won't happen anymore.

659
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:54,922
Gaara will not harm
the people of this village.

660
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:57,049
Never!

661
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:03,597
Convene all members
for an emergency meeting!

662
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:04,765
Yes, sir!

663
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:08,394
You secure the reservoir.
Take two units with you!

664
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:09,603
Yes, sir.

665
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:11,647
Seal off the roads in sector A!

666
00:53:11,672 --> 00:53:12,381
Yes, sir!

667
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,692
We must not assume
there's only one enemy!

668
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:16,985
No matter what happens,
maintain preparations for battle.

669
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:18,387
We must be ready to respond!

670
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:20,155
Medical Team!

671
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:24,660
Set up a barrier and lead
all villagers inside! Hurry!

672
00:53:25,494 --> 00:53:29,081
There must not be even one casualty!
Is that clear?!

673
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:39,341
We'll provide full support for Gaara...
No... for Lord Kazekage!

674
00:53:42,428 --> 00:53:43,429
Gaara...

675
00:53:51,085 --> 00:53:53,755
Interference from below really
puts a damper on things...

676
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:56,734
And besides...

677
00:53:58,527 --> 00:54:01,488
I'm tired of looking at
your expressionless face.

678
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:24,136
<i>It's a doll molded from
detonating clay that's got chakra</i>

679
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:26,472
<i>and clay eaten by my palm
mixed together...</i>

680
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:29,475
<i>This specialty of mine...</i>

681
00:54:29,742 --> 00:54:33,912
<i>It's packed with C3,
my most powerful chakra.</i>

682
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:37,274
<i>The explosive power is an exquisite
work of art that I'm very proud of!</i>

683
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:41,236
- What's that? Hey!
- Yeah, what the hell is it?

684
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:45,073
This is not good! Get back!

685
00:54:45,491 --> 00:54:46,658
You're too late.

686
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:26,114
Wh-What's this?

687
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,450
It's Lord Kazekage's sand...!

688
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:32,454
Wow! Look at the size
of the shield he made!

689
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,758
Okay, you're within...

690
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:50,138
range!

691
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:52,933
Gaara!

692
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:07,030
I'd expect no less...

693
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:09,950
That special sand he carries makes
for a quick defense.

694
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,705
However...

695
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,085
<i>That's just what I want.</i>

696
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:34,725
<i>My left hand was crushed...</i>

697
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:39,521
<i>Sand Coffin.</i>

698
00:56:40,558 --> 00:56:43,019
<i>However, I used that opportunity
to eat some of your sand...</i>

699
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:46,646
<i>and mix it with my bomb clay.</i>

700
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:51,700
<i>You were doomed the instant you used
that sand to defend yourself.</i>

701
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:57,247
<i>That being said,
I planned it that way!</i>

702
00:57:02,294 --> 00:57:03,587
Art...

703
00:57:04,046 --> 00:57:06,006
- <i>Oh, no...</i>
- ... is explosive!

704
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:13,639
Lord Kazekage!

705
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:17,935
It-It can't be!
Gaara's Ultimate Defense was...

706
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:20,020
What the hell did he do...?

707
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,413
I guess I'll go retrieve him.

708
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:46,880
It was harder than
I thought not to kill him...

709
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,234
Mission complete.

710
00:58:16,691 --> 00:58:18,568
Gaara!

711
00:58:39,808 --> 00:58:40,934
Damn you!

712
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:54,364
Cease fire immediately!
We might hit the Kazekage!

713
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:56,116
Y-Yes sir!

714
00:58:56,650 --> 00:58:57,818
Cease fire!

715
00:58:58,618 --> 00:58:59,619
Cease fire!

716
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,079
Cease fire!

717
00:59:01,602 --> 00:59:02,812
Stop the attack!

718
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:08,670
My man Sasori must be getting tired
of waiting for me.

719
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:13,109
<i>Is he going to take him
away alive?!</i>

720
00:59:14,426 --> 00:59:15,552
I won't let him get away!

721
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:16,803
Kankuro!

722
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:19,751
Don't be running off carelessly!

723
00:59:19,903 --> 00:59:21,696
Wait until we can get
a unit together!

724
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:23,977
We'll lose him if
we just sit around!

725
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,520
I'll catch up soon!

726
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,189
Don't go after him too far
on your own!

727
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,940
Yeah...! I know!

728
00:59:33,246 --> 00:59:35,290
My mission is accomplished.

729
00:59:37,202 --> 00:59:38,745
You're late...

730
00:59:39,278 --> 00:59:41,405
I told you not to keep me waiting!

731
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:46,541
Cut me some slack...
This guy was pretty strong.

732
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:51,963
That's why I told you to make sure
you were prepared.

733
00:59:52,521 --> 00:59:53,814
How about the preparations here?

734
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:55,006
Things are all ready here.

735
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:57,177
I had plenty of time, you see...

736
00:59:57,533 --> 01:00:00,286
I was fully prepared unlike you.

737
01:00:01,997 --> 01:00:04,291
Then, let's get out of here.

738
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:24,746
Wh-What's this...?!

739
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:27,457
What a mess...

740
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:34,422
They weren't attacked just now...

741
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:37,592
It might've been before Gaara
started to fight...

742
01:00:37,926 --> 01:00:39,970
There were even elite ANBU Black Ops
members here...

743
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:43,306
They must have been attacked at once
by a rather large group?

744
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:45,837
Or perhaps...

745
01:00:46,593 --> 01:00:47,370
Perhaps...?

746
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,230
No. It's nothing...

747
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:55,235
From the looks of this,

748
01:00:55,576 --> 01:00:59,413
the guys who took Gaara just
passed straight through here.

749
01:00:59,531 --> 01:01:00,574
Hurry! We're going after them!

750
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:01,575
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

751
01:01:06,368 --> 01:01:07,619
There's someone still alive!

752
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:11,960
Stop! Don't move him carelessly...

753
01:01:14,129 --> 01:01:15,255
A paper bomb?!

754
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:25,432
Looks like they fell for your trap,
my man Sasori.

755
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:32,147
Of course. Traps are made
to be fallen into.

756
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:33,773
I get it.

757
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:45,368
Deploy a pursuit unit and
have them go after Kankuro immediately!

758
01:01:45,577 --> 01:01:46,578
Yes, sir!

759
01:01:46,803 --> 01:01:50,265
And contact the Hidden Leaf immediately
regarding this situation!

760
01:01:50,449 --> 01:01:52,659
Tell them it's an emergency! Got it?!

761
01:01:52,932 --> 01:01:53,933
Yes, sir!

762
01:01:55,103 --> 01:01:56,771
<i>I have a bad feeling about this...</i>

763
01:01:56,796 --> 01:02:00,555
<i>Something...
Something's about to happen...!</i>

764
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:14,105
I'm counting on you, Takamaru!

765
01:02:22,364 --> 01:02:23,365
Go!

766
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:37,879
All right...!

767
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:48,348
What are you doing up so early...?

768
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:59,109
Everyone's still sleeping,
you know.

769
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:02,404
You...?!

770
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:08,243
I can't leave the village unattended
for too long...

771
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,745
My business here is finished,

772
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:13,164
so I just thought I'd head back
as soon as possible...

773
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:15,792
Without even eating breakfast?

774
01:03:16,628 --> 01:03:19,229
I'll just find a teahouse or something
along the way and eat there.

775
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:21,965
What are you doing here?

776
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:27,387
It's a pain, but I'm supposed
to be your guide.

777
01:03:28,013 --> 01:03:29,973
I have no choice seeing
as how it's a mission.

778
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,226
Must be quite a hassle...

779
01:03:37,105 --> 01:03:38,189
Here is fine...

780
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:41,818
The next time we meet will be at
the Chunin Exam?

781
01:03:42,277 --> 01:03:44,487
Yeah... See you around...

782
01:03:48,408 --> 01:03:50,869
It's about time you become
a Jonin.

783
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,579
It'll happen before you know it

784
01:03:52,726 --> 01:03:55,604
if you stop saying everything's a drag
and just do your missions...

785
01:04:04,049 --> 01:04:05,425
What a drag...

786
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:23,276
What is it, my man Sasori?

787
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:27,447
I never thought...
someone would be following us.

788
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:29,199
Hold it!

789
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:36,623
I found you...!

790
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:40,877
You will return Gaara to me!

791
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:51,137
Deidara... You go on ahead...

792
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,187
<i>As I recall...</i>

793
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:03,775
<i>he was the one who took Gaara
using that strange bird...</i>

794
01:05:04,481 --> 01:05:08,569
<i>Then this must be the guy
who set the trap in the village...</i>

795
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:19,499
I'll show you... my puppet show!

796
01:05:21,376 --> 01:05:22,377
<i>Crow!</i>

797
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:25,422
<i>Black Ant!</i>

798
01:05:25,797 --> 01:05:26,798
<i>Salamander!</i>

799
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:44,941
I'll say it again...
You will give Gaara back to me!

800
01:05:48,871 --> 01:05:50,664
Puppet Master Jutsu, huh...?

801
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:57,412
Then I'm going on ahead!

802
01:05:58,204 --> 01:05:59,247
You're not going anywhere!

803
01:06:09,257 --> 01:06:10,258
Wha--?!

804
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:13,094
I don't like waiting for people,

805
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:15,455
and I don't like
making people wait...

806
01:06:20,025 --> 01:06:21,860
I'll finish this right away.

807
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,398
You're late!

808
01:06:25,607 --> 01:06:26,941
Finally, you're here...

809
01:06:27,609 --> 01:06:29,777
Gee, sorry about that...

810
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:32,697
This time it took longer
than I thought

811
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:34,407
to write up the documents
for the new team.

812
01:06:34,530 --> 01:06:40,453
Today's our new team's first mission!
Aren't you fired up?!

813
01:06:40,707 --> 01:06:43,752
You've always been like that,
Kakashi-sensei!

814
01:06:43,862 --> 01:06:46,531
Oh, come on.
You're already annoying!

815
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:48,880
It can't be helped.

816
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:51,466
Kakashi-sensei's always had
that look of disinterest!

817
01:06:52,217 --> 01:06:55,220
<i>I'm starting to lose
my dignity here.</i>

818
01:07:04,145 --> 01:07:06,481
<i>If I'm not mistaken,
that's one of the Hidden Sand's...</i>

819
01:07:15,657 --> 01:07:17,867
Where'd this one come from
so early in the morning?

820
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:22,664
Th-This is Takamaru, the fastest
messenger hawk in the Hidden Sand!

821
01:07:24,656 --> 01:07:25,404
Break!

822
01:07:30,088 --> 01:07:31,089
What's this...?!

823
01:07:32,507 --> 01:07:34,384
It's a level-one emergency message!

824
01:07:35,193 --> 01:07:36,736
Contact the Cipher Corps
immediately!

825
01:07:37,921 --> 01:07:40,465
It's sure been a long time
since I've been on a mission...

826
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:42,034
I'm so excited!

827
01:07:42,267 --> 01:07:44,894
Naruto, accept the mission
without complaint,

828
01:07:44,936 --> 01:07:46,896
no matter what we're ordered to do.

829
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:48,940
I know!

830
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,608
I hope so...

831
01:07:52,307 --> 01:07:53,558
Move it, move it!

832
01:07:54,505 --> 01:07:55,506
What was that?

833
01:07:55,601 --> 01:07:58,396
Watch it, you! Be more careful!

834
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:00,660
<i>So the Cipher Corps
was summoned, huh...?</i>

835
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:04,038
<i>Then what the bird from earlier
brought must've been...</i>

836
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:05,999
Whaaat?!

837
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:08,793
Guarding a gold transport convoy?!

838
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:11,588
Huh? You got a problem?!

839
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:13,673
That's totally a C-rank mission!

840
01:08:13,719 --> 01:08:16,305
I'll just have to say no thanks
to a mission like that...

841
01:08:16,467 --> 01:08:19,053
<i>And here I just told him
not to complain.</i>

842
01:08:19,262 --> 01:08:21,889
<i>Please don't act so selfish...</i>

843
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:24,017
<i>I'm the one she's going to get mad at...</i>

844
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:27,937
<i>I knew he'd react like this...
Good grief...</i>

845
01:08:28,571 --> 01:08:31,240
<i>Ohh, just as you thought...</i>

846
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:38,489
Naruto, you haven't matured
mentally at all, have you...?

847
01:08:38,764 --> 01:08:39,765
Naruto...

848
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:44,787
I gave you an easier mission since
this is more or less a comeback for you...

849
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:47,248
I didn't ask for this!

850
01:08:47,383 --> 01:08:51,679
I-I'm sorry! I'll give him
a good scolding later...

851
01:08:52,297 --> 01:08:54,800
<i>Y-You moron!
You can talk like that</i>

852
01:08:54,825 --> 01:08:57,828
<i>because you don't know
how frightening she can be... Cha!</i>

853
01:08:58,885 --> 01:09:01,012
The details of the mission
are written here.

854
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:02,221
Right!

855
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:03,556
Honestly...

856
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:07,810
The old man Third Hokage
was much more understanding...

857
01:09:07,927 --> 01:09:09,762
Huh? Did you say something?!

858
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:12,982
Hey! Knock it off!

859
01:09:14,025 --> 01:09:15,735
Th-There's trouble... Fifth Hokage!

860
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:17,195
What's all the fuss about?

861
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:20,281
We've just gotten word that
the Hidden Sand's Kazekage has been

862
01:09:20,306 --> 01:09:23,142
abducted by an organization
known as the Akatsuki.

863
01:09:25,122 --> 01:09:26,248
<i>Gaara was—?!</i>

864
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:29,666
Team Kakashi,
I'm assigning you a new mission.

865
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:33,252
You're to go to
the Sand Village at once,

866
01:09:33,277 --> 01:09:35,712
find out what's going on there,
and keep us informed.

867
01:09:36,394 --> 01:09:38,270
You're to remain there
and follow their orders.

868
01:09:38,469 --> 01:09:39,970
Give them any backup they need.

869
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:41,094
Right!

870
01:09:48,821 --> 01:09:49,905
<i>How...?</i>

871
01:09:50,061 --> 01:09:53,189
<i>How can he read
my hidden weapon attack schemes...?</i>

872
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:55,489
You've got solid talent...

873
01:09:55,732 --> 01:09:58,359
However, you picked
the wrong opponent.

874
01:10:00,988 --> 01:10:05,076
Your puppets
with the hidden poison weapons...

875
01:10:08,312 --> 01:10:10,480
I can see through them all...

876
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:18,214
Crow! Black Ant! Salamander!

877
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:23,995
<i>This is the first time my hidden

878
01:10:25,713 --> 01:10:27,631
You look puzzled...

879
01:10:27,874 --> 01:10:30,043
You're wondering how
I figured out your attacks, huh?

880
01:10:30,068 --> 01:10:31,569
Of course, I did.

881
01:10:31,825 --> 01:10:32,993
Crow...

882
01:10:33,271 --> 01:10:34,480
Black Ant...

883
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:35,857
Salamander...

884
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:42,196
The one who created these
three puppets is none other... than me!

885
01:10:48,373 --> 01:10:52,544
I ended up making
someone wait a bit...

886
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:55,293
But I never thought my opponent
would be

887
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:57,295
one of my adorable juniors
using hand-me-downs.

888
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:59,948
I haven't had such a fun fight
in quite some time.

889
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:06,763
Then, you're... the renowned master
of the Puppet Brigade,

890
01:11:07,555 --> 01:11:09,766
Sasori of the Red Sand?!

891
01:11:13,227 --> 01:11:18,483
I'm honored that a kid like you
knows my name.

892
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:20,860
You defected from the Sand over 20 years ago.

893
01:11:20,885 --> 01:11:22,310
What are you doing here?!

894
01:11:23,818 --> 01:11:27,863
What's the point of asking such
a thing before you die?

895
01:11:40,421 --> 01:11:44,258
The poison's circulating, huh...?
You're finished!

896
01:11:57,384 --> 01:12:03,182
You're just going to suffer.
But if you want to live that badly...

897
01:12:03,694 --> 01:12:05,947
I won't finish you off!

898
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:11,327
However, that poison will kill you
in less than three days.

899
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:18,501
<i>Gaara...</i>

900
01:12:27,173 --> 01:12:28,716
<i>Damn it...!</i>

901
01:12:30,805 --> 01:12:32,562
There he is! He's over there!

902
01:12:32,587 --> 01:12:35,231
He's collapsed!
And his puppets are smashed...

903
01:12:36,978 --> 01:12:38,896
Okay, we're off now!

904
01:12:42,233 --> 01:12:45,194
We'll be back, Lady Tsunade.

905
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:46,779
Right...

906
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:52,577
Naruto, good luck!

907
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:54,120
Thanks.

908
01:12:58,165 --> 01:12:59,166
Hey!

909
01:12:59,417 --> 01:13:01,085
Are you off on a mission now, Naruto?

910
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:02,211
That's right!

911
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:04,088
Oh, more importantly.

912
01:13:08,270 --> 01:13:09,980
Tsunade, I've got some information
for you.

913
01:13:10,347 --> 01:13:12,599
- The Kazekage of the Hidden Sand...
- I know.

914
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:15,685
I'm just about to send them off
to the Sand now.

915
01:13:17,643 --> 01:13:18,978
Right, right.

916
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:24,859
You know about the Akatsuki
and Naruto, don't you...?

917
01:13:25,238 --> 01:13:26,739
It's an emergency situation you see...

918
01:13:26,944 --> 01:13:28,571
I just made the best choice I could.

919
01:13:29,363 --> 01:13:30,948
Oh, come on...

920
01:13:32,867 --> 01:13:34,994
Naruto, come here for a second.

921
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:36,162
Hm?

922
01:13:39,167 --> 01:13:43,547
Listen up, Naruto.
Don't get reckless against the Akatsuki.

923
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:45,755
They've got business with me.

924
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:48,424
So this time I'll go to them!

925
01:13:48,672 --> 01:13:51,174
You have indeed gotten stronger...

926
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:55,097
But if you don't stay calm,
you'll just be asking for trouble.

927
01:13:55,611 --> 01:13:58,697
Losing your cool right away
is a bad habit of yours.

928
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:07,860
Naruto... I think you know...

929
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:10,112
But don't use that power.

930
01:14:15,009 --> 01:14:16,510
I know...

931
01:14:21,666 --> 01:14:23,000
Kakashi...

932
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:26,128
Keep an eye on Naruto and make sure
he doesn't do anything too reckless.

933
01:14:26,275 --> 01:14:28,152
I'm counting on you. Okay?

934
01:14:29,548 --> 01:14:30,549
Okay.

935
01:14:31,842 --> 01:14:35,137
Kakashi-sensei, Sakura,
let's get a move on!

936
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:37,056
H-Hey, wait up!

937
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:39,558
We're off.

938
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:43,604
Oh boy...

939
01:14:44,855 --> 01:14:45,982
Are you worried?

940
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:47,316
No, I'm not...

941
01:14:47,496 --> 01:14:52,543
He's no longer a weak shinobi
I need to worry about...

942
01:14:53,032 --> 01:14:54,367
And the same goes for Sakura.

943
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:58,369
Growth is sure a mysterious thing.

944
01:15:03,207 --> 01:15:05,084
<i>Hang on, Gaara!</i>
