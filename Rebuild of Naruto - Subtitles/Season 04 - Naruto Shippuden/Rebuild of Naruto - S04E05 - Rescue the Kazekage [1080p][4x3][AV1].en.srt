1
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:13,138
There's a paper bomb left here, too!

2
00:00:15,762 --> 00:00:17,972
It's a type that explodes
the instant it's peeled off...

3
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:19,978
We'll just have to detonate it.

4
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:21,104
I see.

5
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,023
We're detonating a paper bomb!

6
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:25,025
Stop working and take cover!

7
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:29,779
This is no time to be discussing
candidates for a new Kazekage!

8
00:00:29,889 --> 00:00:32,266
But if you think about
the worst-case scenario,

9
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:35,368
isn't it important to seize
the initiative?

10
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:39,080
More importantly, rescuing Lord Kazekage
should be our priority!

11
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:42,000
Securing village safety
is what's important!

12
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,545
We must not break up
our limited forces in conditions like this.

13
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:46,755
What did you say?!

14
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:48,590
Reporting!

15
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:52,469
The bodies of the sky watch
have all been identified.

16
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,430
There's little doubt the enemy infiltrated

17
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,806
the center of the village from the sky...

18
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:57,849
Excuse me!

19
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,350
What?!

20
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:01,519
We have been contacted
by the tracking unit.

21
00:01:01,627 --> 00:01:04,421
Kankuro was discovered about half
a day's travel from the village.

22
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,649
He is unconscious and
in serious condition.

23
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,071
<i>Kankuro...</i>

24
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:15,992
Some members of the tracking unit
have recovered Kankuro and his puppets.

25
00:01:16,017 --> 00:01:17,852
They are on their way
back to the village.

26
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,163
What about the location
of Lord Kazekage?

27
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,207
The remaining members of
the tracking unit are in pursuit.

28
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,792
There should be a report soon...

29
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,929
Master Sasori, you're late.

30
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:40,100
I thought you didn't like to
keep people waiting.

31
00:01:40,536 --> 00:01:44,999
But... I had enough fun
to make up for that.

32
00:01:46,324 --> 00:01:48,284
What's up with that?

33
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,152
Don't get so touchy.

34
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:55,532
You did capture your target,
the One-Tail, after all.

35
00:01:56,574 --> 00:02:01,121
My mission is next...
once I've taken care of this guy.

36
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,040
But the one you're after...

37
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:08,044
Yeah, I still don't know where he is...

38
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:12,090
It'd be easier if
he'd just come to me...

39
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,864
Yeah... That's right...

40
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,806
What kind of Jinchuriki
was he again?

41
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:24,021
Well, worst case scenario,
even if I can't find him...

42
00:02:25,283 --> 00:02:30,622
nobody can complain
since we caught one of the Jinchuriki.

43
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,452
Temari!

44
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,045
Hurry up and get him
to the operating room!

45
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,344
Is this... poison?!

46
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,429
Prepare an antidote!

47
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,808
Gaara...

48
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,894
What?! Gaara was...?!

49
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,192
It'll take about two and a half days
to reach the Sand from here...

50
00:04:36,422 --> 00:04:37,423
Let's hurry.

51
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:38,820
Right.

52
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:45,159
The wounds weren't that serious...

53
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:46,911
The problem is...

54
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,539
The poison, huh...?

55
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,417
Yes, it's a completely new poison.

56
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,128
We have absolutely no idea
how to neutralize it.

57
00:04:56,045 --> 00:05:00,258
Gaara... and now Kankuro, too...

58
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:17,815
Naruto! I told you not to break formation.

59
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,383
I don't like it!

60
00:05:22,445 --> 00:05:26,700
Even I know why they're after
people like Gaara and me...

61
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:30,066
You know it already,
don't you, Sakura...?

62
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,500
That I've got...

63
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:39,588
... the Nine-Tailed Fox
sealed inside me...

64
00:05:45,716 --> 00:05:51,347
Gaara and I both...
have monsters inside us...

65
00:05:52,257 --> 00:05:56,136
That's what they're after!

66
00:05:57,574 --> 00:05:59,201
That's what I don't like!

67
00:05:59,761 --> 00:06:02,055
They only see us as monsters!

68
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:05,178
I don't like their selfish way
of viewing us!

69
00:06:08,685 --> 00:06:12,439
Everything about us...
was the same...

70
00:06:14,021 --> 00:06:19,109
And he... fought all by himself
a lot more than me...

71
00:06:21,153 --> 00:06:23,030
The Akatsuki was after him!

72
00:06:24,103 --> 00:06:25,938
It's just like me this time, too...

73
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:27,712
And yet,

74
00:06:27,737 --> 00:06:31,045
why does he always get
the short end of the stick?

75
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,771
It's always him!

76
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:38,482
That's why I can't be wasting
any time getting to him!

77
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,490
<i>Naruto...</i>

78
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,538
<i>Thank you...</i>

79
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,595
You say Kankuro's regained
consciousness?

80
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:14,851
He has, but he's just barely
able to respond to us...

81
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,061
His condition has worsened
since yesterday.

82
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,877
Baki... Is that you...?

83
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:25,778
Kankuro!

84
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,865
It's... it's him...

85
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,126
Don't raise your voice!

86
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,535
It's not good for you
in your condition!

87
00:07:33,197 --> 00:07:36,325
Th-the Red Sand...

88
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:41,671
I see... So that explains it...

89
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,546
Lord Baki...?

90
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,010
Oh, Lord Baki.

91
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:52,330
Contact the tracking unit!
Tell them to turn back immediately!

92
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:55,627
Actually, we haven't heard
anything from them

93
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,435
since recovering Kankuro yesterday...

94
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,604
We were too late...

95
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,314
Huh? What is it?

96
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,275
Nothing...
I'm... going out for a bit.

97
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,860
Oh, but...!

98
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,074
<i>I have no choice but to consult
with the Elder Siblings...</i>

99
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:17,038
<i>But I wonder...
will they come to our aid willingly?</i>

100
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,251
Naruto.

101
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,173
You've met him before, haven't you?

102
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,259
Itachi Uchiha...

103
00:08:31,957 --> 00:08:34,835
And he's after you.

104
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,686
I didn't just train over these past
two and a half years.

105
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,273
I got into Master Tsunade's library

106
00:08:43,298 --> 00:08:45,592
and did outside investigations
the best I could.

107
00:08:46,272 --> 00:08:51,152
And now... what was bothering me
finally makes sense!

108
00:08:52,254 --> 00:08:54,590
The person Sasuke wants to kill...

109
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:57,822
is his own older brother
Itachi Uchiha, right...?

110
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,206
A member of the Akatsuki!

111
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,172
That's why Sasuke is with Orochimaru
in an attempt to obtain power...

112
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:12,260
But Orochimaru is
after Sasuke's body, right?

113
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,929
And we only have six months left!

114
00:09:17,144 --> 00:09:18,979
<i>Sakura knows about that too...</i>

115
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:23,837
And Orochimaru used to be
a member of the Akatsuki.

116
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:28,026
Basically, what I'm trying to say is...

117
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,363
The closer we get to the Akatsuki,

118
00:09:32,388 --> 00:09:34,557
the closer we get to information
about Orochimaru...

119
00:09:38,618 --> 00:09:40,161
If that happens...

120
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,251
we'll eventually get closer to Sasuke!

121
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,298
<i>And after that, Itachi Uchiha...</i>

122
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,259
<i>Our worst enemy who
plagued Sasuke for so long...</i>

123
00:09:53,284 --> 00:09:55,369
<i>and the one who's after Naruto...</i>

124
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,462
It appears someone's come...

125
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,008
Say, Big Sister...

126
00:10:41,665 --> 00:10:42,916
Are you dead?

127
00:10:56,502 --> 00:11:00,297
Gotcha! I was playing dead.

128
00:11:06,896 --> 00:11:10,942
Cut it out. That senility act's
a little too real, Sis.

129
00:11:18,935 --> 00:11:20,020
Honorable Elders...

130
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:23,974
I have come to request
your assistance.

131
00:11:26,572 --> 00:11:29,575
Old books are supposed
to be tied in a bundle

132
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:31,798
and left up on a high shelf...

133
00:11:32,674 --> 00:11:35,385
What can we possibly do now...?

134
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,323
An organization called the Akatsuki
has taken the Shukaku.

135
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:42,284
If we leave things as they stand now,
there will be great trouble.

136
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:47,873
It's your generation's problem now.
You deal with it yourselves.

137
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:51,627
You two have powerful connections
with each land,

138
00:11:51,922 --> 00:11:55,467
including villages in lands
we are not allied with...

139
00:11:56,092 --> 00:11:59,596
There's only so much information
we can gather on our own...

140
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,847
We've long since been retired.

141
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:06,091
We no longer have
any attachments to the world.

142
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:11,727
Although I guess it'd be nice to see
my grandchild's face one more time...

143
00:12:11,908 --> 00:12:13,243
That's very convenient.

144
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:19,363
Your grandson is a member
of the Akatsuki.

145
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:21,782
Granny Chiyo...

146
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:34,378
Who are they?

147
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,921
Oh, that's...

148
00:12:36,364 --> 00:12:38,658
Granny Chiyo... and Ebizo.

149
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:42,094
No way. I thought they were supposed
to have long since been retired.

150
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:55,107
Hm? If I'm not mistaken, this is...

151
00:12:55,596 --> 00:12:56,681
It's Kankuro.

152
00:12:56,869 --> 00:12:59,037
The current Kazekage's older brother.

153
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,447
Oh, that's right.

154
00:13:04,046 --> 00:13:07,299
I've never seen...
a composition like this before.

155
00:13:07,707 --> 00:13:11,753
Ordinarily, he would just finish them off...

156
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:15,961
It appears he's very confident
about his poison.

157
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:21,175
Leaving his prey as is
on purpose is just like Sasori.

158
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,102
This is not good.

159
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:37,691
Poisons are my specialty,
but even I can't analyze this.

160
00:13:38,122 --> 00:13:39,332
Even you, Lady Chiyo...?

161
00:13:39,357 --> 00:13:41,568
At best, he has one day...

162
00:13:41,928 --> 00:13:46,766
He may not even make it
to dawn tomorrow, I'd say.

163
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:52,456
That Sasori has sure grown considerably.

164
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,375
What in the world should we do?

165
00:13:54,781 --> 00:13:58,702
Well, the only one who might
know more about antidotes than me

166
00:13:58,784 --> 00:14:01,787
would be the Leaf's Slug Princess, Tsunade.

167
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,553
I had a lot of trouble with her
during the Great War.

168
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:10,224
She would decipher all the poisons
I created and concoct antidotes.

169
00:14:10,694 --> 00:14:13,363
And now we're allies with the Leaf.

170
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:17,773
All we can do is send for her and
have her look at Kankuro.

171
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:21,110
But she is now the Hokage

172
00:14:21,263 --> 00:14:24,641
and would not be able to
leave her village so easily.

173
00:14:24,771 --> 00:14:28,107
And even if she were to come,

174
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,744
it takes three days to get here
from the Leaf.

175
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:36,250
I know. Nobody's seriously thinking
of summoning her.

176
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:40,963
I don't like that slug girl, anyway.

177
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,340
Did you call me, Lady Tsunade?

178
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:44,884
Yes...

179
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:48,345
I want to send reinforcements to
the Village Hidden in the Sand.

180
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:49,889
Reinforcements?

181
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:53,295
They should be about done
with their previous mission

182
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,758
and on their way back by now.

183
00:14:55,746 --> 00:14:56,830
Them?

184
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,857
Oh. Yes, ma'am. I'll make
the preparations immediately.

185
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,946
Should we consider the worst-case scenario?

186
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,874
<i>You're late. Prepare immediately.</i>

187
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:03,671
The Jinchuriki was unexpectedly strong.

188
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,634
<i>All right, gather.</i>

189
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,770
<i>Now, let us begin.</i>

190
00:17:16,504 --> 00:17:18,798
<i>From now, it will take three days
and three nights.</i>

191
00:17:19,027 --> 00:17:21,738
<i>Keep an eye on your real bodies as well.</i>

192
00:17:22,462 --> 00:17:26,508
<i>And Zetsu, use your real body
to keep watch outside for now.</i>

193
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,131
<i>Use the longest range.</i>

194
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,091
<i>I know.</i>

195
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,761
<i>Three days?</i>

196
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:37,140
<i>Shouldn't we consider that it might
take a bit longer</i>

197
00:17:37,165 --> 00:17:39,542
<i>since we don't have Orochimaru?</i>

198
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,728
<i>If that's what you think,
then get right to it.</i>

199
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,858
<i>Sealing Jutsu: Nine Phantom Dragons</i>

200
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:23,036
I'm giving you guys the same mission
as Team Kakashi.

201
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,914
Head for the Sand and
complete the mission

202
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,624
by providing backup for Kakashi
and the others.

203
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:28,625
Got it?!

204
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,627
Yes, ma'am!

205
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,172
Please leave it to us.

206
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,281
Roger.

207
00:19:36,281 --> 00:19:37,282
Understood.

208
00:19:37,687 --> 00:19:38,688
All right!

209
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,804
Team Guy heading into action.

210
00:19:44,181 --> 00:19:44,972
You catch a cold?

211
00:19:44,997 --> 00:19:48,084
No, my hay fever started
acting up before...

212
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:54,026
All right, we'll make it to
the Sand in one day.

213
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,278
Sensei, let's make it in half a day.

214
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,656
It'll take three days, no matter
how you consider it.

215
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:03,410
Sorry to interrupt your excitement,
but we should head out now!

216
00:20:03,474 --> 00:20:05,184
All right, we're leaving!

217
00:20:05,209 --> 00:20:08,095
Let's go, everyone! A youthful dash!

218
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,625
Yes, Guy-sensei!

219
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,376
How embarrassing.

220
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,378
Give it up, Tenten.

221
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,548
They're as energetic as ever.

222
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,723
It's been awhile
since we've seen Naruto.

223
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,561
I'm looking forward to seeing
how much he's grown.

224
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,894
Yeah.

225
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:32,940
Oh!

226
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,445
We've been expecting you.

227
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,447
So you were with them, Temari?

228
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:41,990
Please, come this way.

229
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,953
What?! They got Kankuro, too?

230
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:50,916
Yes, Lord Kazekage was taken and
Kankuro followed in pursuit.

231
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,878
Kankuro was poisoned by the enemy
and we don't know how to neutralize it.

232
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,797
At this rate... he won't...

233
00:20:57,309 --> 00:20:58,310
Damn it!

234
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,592
Let's hurry, Temari.

235
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:02,678
I'll take a look at him.

236
00:21:05,238 --> 00:21:06,239
Kankuro!

237
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,309
Kankuro!

238
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:14,106
<i>He's... the White Fang of the Leaf!</i>

239
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,233
You jerk!

240
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:19,903
Huh?

241
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,322
Prepare yourself!

242
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,578
Why you--!

243
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,603
What's the big idea, pouncing on
Kakashi-sensei like that?!

244
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:37,963
You wrinkly old hag!

245
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,426
<i>This old hag... is good...</i>

246
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,722
I'll never forget what
you did back then!

247
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,183
White Fang of the Leaf,

248
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:54,271
I shall avenge my son's death
by defeating you today!

249
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,148
Er... no, you see... I'm...

250
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,899
No questions or answers!

251
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,947
Sister... Take a good look at him!

252
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:12,164
He resembles him closely,
but this one is not the White Fang!

253
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,457
Huh?

254
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,251
Uh... hello...

255
00:22:16,739 --> 00:22:20,785
Moreover, the White Fang
of the Leaf died long ago.

256
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,800
Remember?

257
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,053
When you got word of it,
you cried tears of regret,

258
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:29,139
since you could not avenge
your son.

259
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:34,227
Gotcha, I was only pretending
to have gone senile.

260
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,533
Kankuro!

261
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:49,826
Let me take a look.

262
00:22:50,522 --> 00:22:51,523
Please do.

263
00:22:51,548 --> 00:22:54,467
Kakashi-sensei and the rest of you,
please stand back a bit.

264
00:22:54,812 --> 00:22:56,063
Got it.

265
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:18,271
They seem to have used
a heavy metal-based toxin.

266
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:22,401
It's the type that acts upon
the muscles to destroy the cells.

267
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,279
Just from that brief examination...

268
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:27,614
You could tell that much...

269
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,366
His medical record please.

270
00:23:29,391 --> 00:23:31,059
Ah, here it is.

271
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,745
This is the list
of toxic ingredients.

272
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,039
There are blank spaces here
and there, but...

273
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,500
I can predict the general outcome.

274
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,295
The cardiac muscle
will be destroyed,

275
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,923
and the heart could stop beating
at any time, so...

276
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:49,010
It's difficult to say whether
we can concoct an antidote in time...

277
00:23:49,272 --> 00:23:51,951
You don't mean that!
Isn't there anything we can do?

278
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,686
Please assemble the items
I request immediately.

279
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:58,937
Roger!

280
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:02,658
It's quite a crude treatment, but
it's the only option we have left.

281
00:24:09,104 --> 00:24:10,904
Hold him down firmly,

282
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,577
as this will be
a very delicate operation.

283
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,537
- Right.
- Understood.

284
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,381
Here... goes...

285
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,017
Hold him down firmly!

286
00:24:37,158 --> 00:24:38,535
- Yes!
- Yes!

287
00:24:39,933 --> 00:24:43,395
<i>I'll cause the chakra
to flow into his body...</i>

288
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,824
<i>It will cause the toxin to
surface from the cells.</i>

289
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,411
<i>It will then be absorbed
by this liquid...</i>

290
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,331
<i>and extracted!</i>

291
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,012
So that's the toxin...

292
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:20,685
Yes!

293
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,731
Next!

294
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:25,815
- Yes!
- Yes!

295
00:25:44,093 --> 00:25:46,137
Say... Kakashi-sensei...

296
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:47,052
Huh?

297
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,548
What sort of person was
that White Fang of the Leaf

298
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,217
that this old lady here
was talking about?

299
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,660
Well, that's hard to say...

300
00:25:56,382 --> 00:25:57,467
Hmm, let's see...

301
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,809
Well, in a word...

302
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,812
He was my father.

303
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,819
Hey, you there...

304
00:26:11,217 --> 00:26:13,370
Are you the son
of the White Fang?

305
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:14,698
Yes...

306
00:26:16,296 --> 00:26:17,589
But of course...

307
00:26:18,162 --> 00:26:20,080
So that's why you look
so much like him...

308
00:26:26,859 --> 00:26:28,527
I directly extracted the toxin.

309
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:31,673
With this, his life should
no longer be in danger.

310
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,267
But we still can't rest easy.

311
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:46,513
I will now concoct an antidote
for the traces of toxin

312
00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:48,790
that remain in his body.

313
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,025
Got it.

314
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:52,845
If you need anything,
don't hesitate to ask.

315
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:55,739
Well then, first, I need a list
of the medicinal herbs

316
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,782
that can be found in this village,
or something like that...

317
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:58,908
I'll bring it.

318
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:00,910
Please replace all of
his bandages.

319
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:01,911
Yes.

320
00:27:02,713 --> 00:27:04,340
And then prepare an IV drip.

321
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,457
Yes.

322
00:27:05,778 --> 00:27:09,365
Also, please set aside a small amount
of the extracted toxin.

323
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:11,212
I will need it later.

324
00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:16,209
<i>Sakura... You're so cool.</i>

325
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,186
You're just like the Slug Princess.

326
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,357
To think that a girl just
like you would come here...

327
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:36,112
Yes, Lady Tsunade is my master.

328
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:39,449
And besides, I was told by
my master to come here.

329
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,621
Here is the list of medicinal herbs.

330
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,081
Thank you.

331
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:55,298
I say, Sister... Time moves slowly,
but it does move on.

332
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,271
I never imagined I'd find
this assortment

333
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:13,566
of medicinal herbs here
in the Hidden Sand.

334
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:18,780
Still, the soil is not well suited
to growing medicinal herbs...

335
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,491
In particular, we only have
a small amount of "Scurvy Grass."

336
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,035
No, this much is plenty.

337
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,705
I can make at least three antidotes.

338
00:28:31,935 --> 00:28:33,937
Kankuro, are you all right?!

339
00:28:35,635 --> 00:28:39,431
What, you're back already, Temari...?

340
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:41,653
I heard the village was in crisis.

341
00:28:42,275 --> 00:28:44,986
Sorry... for making you worry.

342
00:28:45,252 --> 00:28:47,504
You fool, don't talk
such nonsense!

343
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:50,937
Please lead me to the place
where Kankuro did battle.

344
00:28:52,643 --> 00:28:55,312
I may not look it,
but I'm a tracking expert...

345
00:28:55,698 --> 00:28:57,883
If just the slightest trace
of their scent remains...

346
00:28:57,908 --> 00:28:59,326
There's no need of that.

347
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:09,385
My puppets... have all been recovered,
haven't they?

348
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:12,959
The enemy force was two.

349
00:29:13,781 --> 00:29:15,866
One of them led Gaara away...

350
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,923
All you have to do it follow
Gaara's scent.

351
00:29:19,739 --> 00:29:23,611
Even if they split up into two,
one of them...

352
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,182
That one has his scent on it...

353
00:29:33,663 --> 00:29:35,164
In Crow's hand...

354
00:29:35,321 --> 00:29:37,656
I left him holding a scrap
of his clothes...

355
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,240
Even in defeat, you don't go down
without a fight.

356
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,118
Just what I'd expect from
a Sand ninja.

357
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,207
Kankuro! Are you all right?

358
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,751
Y-Yeah...

359
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:03,134
<i>Naruto... Uzumaki... is it?</i>

360
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:05,720
Hey...

361
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:09,039
<i>I see...</i>

362
00:30:10,268 --> 00:30:11,281
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

363
00:30:16,811 --> 00:30:17,937
Pakkun!

364
00:30:18,132 --> 00:30:21,363
Hey! Is that you, Naruto?!
Long time no see.

365
00:30:21,572 --> 00:30:23,407
I need you to get to work
right away!

366
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,483
I want you to determine
which way he headed.

367
00:30:31,113 --> 00:30:32,114
Now, go!

368
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:35,501
We'll contact you right away
when we find something.

369
00:30:38,616 --> 00:30:40,117
We're counting on you.

370
00:30:44,225 --> 00:30:45,684
Kankuro...!

371
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,973
Granny Chiyo?
Grandpa Ebizo, too?!

372
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:53,935
I want to hear it one more time,
directly from your mouth...

373
00:30:54,523 --> 00:30:57,818
There's no doubt that one of the two enemies
was Sasori.

374
00:30:57,843 --> 00:30:59,636
Is that right?

375
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,864
What about it, Kankuro?

376
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:09,549
Yeah... It was Sasori
of the Red Sand.

377
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:11,744
He said so himself.

378
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,002
Sasori of the Red Sand, you say?

379
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:23,214
We might be able to find out more
about Akatsuki.

380
00:31:24,869 --> 00:31:25,979
Please...

381
00:31:33,177 --> 00:31:34,762
Be sure to drink it all down...

382
00:31:40,952 --> 00:31:43,079
You should be all right now, I think.

383
00:31:43,563 --> 00:31:45,940
Just lie there and rest for
a while without moving

384
00:31:45,965 --> 00:31:47,466
until the numbness goes away.

385
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,992
You should all get
a good night's rest as well.

386
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:52,802
I've prepared a room for you to use.

387
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:55,163
But we've got to find Gaara quickly...

388
00:31:55,188 --> 00:31:57,232
I'll take advantage of
your kindness, if I may.

389
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,461
We're going on
a harsh march from tomorrow.

390
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,342
I understand...

391
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:24,442
<i>I just have to work hard and
carve out a future for myself.</i>

392
00:32:24,948 --> 00:32:27,701
<i>And I must not run away
from my path of solitude.</i>

393
00:32:29,367 --> 00:32:31,828
<i>If I do that, someday...</i>

394
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,661
<i>Someday... I can be like him...</i>

395
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,337
Naruto Uzumaki...

396
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:45,755
Mm?

397
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,968
Take care of my little brother...

398
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:55,139
Heh, you can leave it to me.

399
00:32:56,715 --> 00:32:59,259
After all, I'm going to be Hokage someday!

400
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,022
So I'll get on the Kazekage's good side early!

401
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,125
Sister...

402
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,545
Are you taking those with you?

403
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,589
Fate must have meant for this to happen...

404
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:32,927
Nothing will serve me better than
these if I'm going to fight against him...

405
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,892
I've lived too long a life...

406
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:53,781
<i>Over there, huh...</i>

407
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,619
Any closer and I'll be noticed...

408
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:07,587
So... that's where his hideout is.

409
00:34:08,771 --> 00:34:09,897
Most likely.

410
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:12,550
Gaara's scent was also coming
from that same place.

411
00:34:13,024 --> 00:34:14,025
I see.

412
00:34:16,506 --> 00:34:18,216
I have one more favor to ask you.

413
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,475
Huh?

414
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:33,696
Hey, are you awake, Naruto?

415
00:34:34,027 --> 00:34:35,529
Huh? Pakkun...

416
00:34:36,245 --> 00:34:38,038
Okay, Pakkun, I'm counting on you.

417
00:34:39,123 --> 00:34:40,749
See you around then, Naruto!

418
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:48,711
Kakashi-sensei!

419
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,339
Could it be that you've found
the Akatsuki's hideout?

420
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,175
Yeah... We're heading out immediately.

421
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,889
All right, as soon
as the Sand is ready,

422
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:02,492
we'll join them for Gaara's rescue.

423
00:35:02,595 --> 00:35:03,596
Got it?

424
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,269
Sorry to have kept you waiting!

425
00:35:06,785 --> 00:35:07,827
Temari!

426
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:09,607
Everyone's here...

427
00:35:10,494 --> 00:35:13,622
All right! Then let's head out!

428
00:35:13,666 --> 00:35:14,667
Wait!

429
00:35:16,284 --> 00:35:20,622
Temari... You and the others stay here
in the village and patrol the border.

430
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,079
What do you mean by that?!

431
00:35:23,326 --> 00:35:25,286
That's an order from... above.

432
00:35:25,509 --> 00:35:26,510
Huh...?

433
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,626
Their reasoning is...

434
00:35:28,685 --> 00:35:32,581
if it becomes widely known that
the Kazekage is absent,

435
00:35:32,688 --> 00:35:35,034
there's no telling when other villages
will attack our village...

436
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,300
I can't believe this...

437
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,635
That's all the more reason that

438
00:35:37,743 --> 00:35:40,996
we have to get Gaara back
as soon as possible!

439
00:35:41,467 --> 00:35:43,552
These Leaf people came
all this way

440
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,602
for the very purpose of
going to Gaara's aid!

441
00:35:47,543 --> 00:35:50,421
Gaara is our Kazekage, right?!

442
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:53,276
What's the point if we, his own villagers,
don't go to save him?!

443
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:54,902
But...

444
00:35:55,003 --> 00:35:56,463
I'm going.

445
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:12,336
The only Sand shinobi
you need is me!

446
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,005
Granny Chiyo!

447
00:36:14,106 --> 00:36:15,775
But that's...

448
00:36:16,938 --> 00:36:18,982
I am already retired, you know...

449
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:22,638
I can do whatever I like.

450
00:36:22,829 --> 00:36:25,034
You really shouldn't overdo it...!

451
00:36:25,706 --> 00:36:28,537
Don't you dare treat me
like an old woman!

452
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:31,647
<i>She jumped!</i>

453
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:32,732
Wha--?!

454
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:40,448
I haven't had a chance to dote on my dear
grandson in a while, after all.

455
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,433
All right, we'll head out.

456
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:12,271
I'm sorry. I'll try to convince the council...

457
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,815
We'll follow behind later, no matter what!

458
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:21,072
Gaara will be long rescued by that time!

459
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,240
See you later!

460
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,882
Hey, we're going a little too fast!

461
00:37:40,168 --> 00:37:42,504
We haven't stopped running
since we left!

462
00:37:42,955 --> 00:37:44,964
Let's take a little break!

463
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,474
Tenten, you need more training!

464
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,060
Lee! In front of you!

465
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:57,650
Wait, Guy!

466
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,485
Pakkun!

467
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:04,865
Kakashi directed us,
the Eight Ninja Hounds,

468
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,878
to fan out in every direction

469
00:38:06,903 --> 00:38:09,280
to follow the Akatsuki's scent.

470
00:38:09,756 --> 00:38:11,508
While we were doing that,
we realized that

471
00:38:11,533 --> 00:38:13,660
those guys were headed towards
the Land of Rivers

472
00:38:13,685 --> 00:38:15,395
which is situated between
the Leaf and Sand.

473
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,211
The Land of Rivers...?

474
00:38:17,808 --> 00:38:18,809
That's right.

475
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:20,582
In other words,

476
00:38:20,607 --> 00:38:23,735
you guys are closest to the Akatsuki
at this point in time.

477
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,429
You, who were heading from
the Leaf to the Sand Village.

478
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:29,974
I see...

479
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:34,854
Follow me...
I'll explain the details as we run.

480
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,982
All right! Let's go, everybody!

481
00:38:38,007 --> 00:38:39,634
Huh? Already?

482
00:39:16,933 --> 00:39:21,339
<i>An enemy is nearing
this hideout.</i>

483
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:23,903
An enemy, you said?

484
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:26,949
<i>And a highly skilled one at that.</i>

485
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:30,451
<i>His name is... Might Guy.</i>

486
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,828
<i>Who's that?</i>

487
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:36,916
<i>A Leaf Jonin ninja who
uses taijutsu.</i>

488
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:39,960
<i>He's one clever operator.
Don't underestimate him.</i>

489
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:43,965
<i>Ah! That strange beast...</i>

490
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:48,469
<i>We will use that jutsu...</i>

491
00:39:50,042 --> 00:39:51,960
<i>In that case, I'll go...</i>

492
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:57,144
<i>I was getting irritated for not
having any luck finding a Jinchuriki.</i>

493
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,147
<i>No, I'll go...</i>

494
00:40:00,251 --> 00:40:04,839
<i>I have something of a personal quarrel
with him, you see...</i>

495
00:40:04,965 --> 00:40:07,611
<i>You're right. That jutsu is more suited
to someone like you.</i>

496
00:40:07,636 --> 00:40:12,677
<i>Among the Akatsuki,
you have the most chakra, Kisame.</i>

497
00:40:13,434 --> 00:40:14,435
<i>Yes...</i>

498
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,832
<i>Even so, I'll take 30%
of your chakra.</i>

499
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,128
<i>Well, well, well...</i>

500
00:40:21,153 --> 00:40:23,656
It looks like I'll finally be
able to get pay back

501
00:40:23,784 --> 00:40:26,703
for that kick he gave me...

502
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,231
Naruto!

503
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,693
Can I ask you something?

504
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:50,197
Since when have you been
targeted by the Akatsuki?

505
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:54,827
I don't know...

506
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,180
There was that one time when
two people from the Akatsuki

507
00:41:01,205 --> 00:41:03,935
came to the Leaf Village in order to
make contact with Naruto.

508
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:06,923
But that was three years ago...

509
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:09,212
and they've just started
making a move now.

510
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:10,926
I don't know why.

511
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:14,305
Why did they wait three years?

512
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:17,016
It could be that it's not because
they didn't want to,

513
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:18,726
but because they couldn't.

514
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:22,688
Because Lord Jiraiya was always
hanging close to Naruto...

515
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:24,440
No...

516
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:28,527
There's quite a bit of preparation involved

517
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:32,156
to draw out a Tailed Beast that's sealed
within someone.

518
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,991
They encountered difficulties with that.

519
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:37,077
What's this "Tailed Beast"
that you were talking about?

520
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,454
What?!

521
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:42,458
You're Tsunade's disciple
and you don't even know that?!

522
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:45,794
The Leaf Village had
the Nine-Tailed Fox...

523
00:41:49,517 --> 00:41:53,427
The Nine-Tailed Fox is treated as
top secret amongst the Leaf Village...

524
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:57,198
Well, that's not surprising, I guess...

525
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:01,860
A Tailed Beast refers to
Beast Spirits with tails.

526
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:06,190
Long, long ago,
the Sand had the One-Tail.

527
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:10,069
That's the Shukaku sealed
within Gaara.

528
00:42:10,349 --> 00:42:11,434
One-Tail?

529
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,989
Do you mean that there are
other beasts

530
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:15,366
besides the Nine-Tailed Fox?

531
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:16,492
That's right...

532
00:42:17,345 --> 00:42:20,890
There are a total of nine
tailed beasts in this world...

533
00:42:21,627 --> 00:42:24,130
Tailed beasts have
special characteristics.

534
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:27,127
Each of them have
a different number of tails.

535
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:31,465
The One-Tail has one tail.
The Two-Tails has two.

536
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:34,552
And up to the Nine-Tails
as the name suggests,

537
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:37,429
each name represents
the number of tails the beast has.

538
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,973
The Tailed Beasts have
immense chakra

539
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:43,285
and in the world of ninja,

540
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:46,272
they were used for military purposes
by Hidden Villages around the world.

541
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:48,941
They competed to get their hands on them.

542
00:42:49,897 --> 00:42:56,240
But no one could control a power
that surpassed human understanding.

543
00:42:57,162 --> 00:43:01,499
I don't know why the Akatsuki is after it,

544
00:43:01,921 --> 00:43:04,465
but that power is too dangerous...

545
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:10,504
But in this new peaceful age,
the Tailed Beasts apparently...

546
00:43:10,798 --> 00:43:15,636
still exist, having scattered
all around the world...

547
00:43:26,912 --> 00:43:27,913
What's up?!

548
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:29,648
Someone's coming!

549
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:34,704
<i>Byakugan!</i>

550
00:43:43,417 --> 00:43:44,246
Behind us!

551
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,687
You...

552
00:44:10,566 --> 00:44:13,068
Do you know him, Guy-sensei?!

553
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,446
Don't tell me you're...

554
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:21,158
It appears that you've remembered...

555
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:25,204
Have we met before...?

556
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:31,877
It seems the strange beast has
the intelligence of a beast as well.

557
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:36,882
Well... I'll make you remember soon...

558
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,009
So this is the Akatsuki!

559
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:45,182
<i>Water Style:
Exploding Water Shock Wave!</i>

560
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,731
Here I go!

561
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,912
<i>Leaf Rising Wind!</i>

562
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:12,918
<i>8 Trigrams: Air Palm!</i>

563
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,138
<i>It's programmed!</i>

564
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:37,535
Damn! I let him get away!

565
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,326
Where did he go?

566
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:49,329
In front! He's coming up.

567
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:58,422
Seriously... what a bunch of annoying brats.

568
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,507
It's so bothersome.

569
00:46:01,406 --> 00:46:04,534
The Water Style ninjutsu
and that big sword...

570
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:06,430
You are...!

571
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:11,393
It seems like you have
finally remembered.

572
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,897
I do feel like we have met somewhere.

573
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:22,070
You still can't remember, huh...

574
00:46:22,631 --> 00:46:27,886
You really are good
at hurting people's feelings.

575
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,746
Until you recall...

576
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:36,001
I will take my time putting you
through pain.

577
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:53,602
<i>Another guest...</i>

578
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:57,981
<i>It's a little noisy this time,
isn't it, Deidara!</i>

579
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:03,862
Well, the Jinchuriki was
stronger than the other two...

580
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:07,991
I told you at the start, didn't I?

581
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:12,246
Your jutsu wasn't suited
for covert operations.

582
00:47:12,478 --> 00:47:16,941
I'd say your traps were
pretty loud too, weren't they?

583
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:19,253
What!

584
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:20,754
<i>Stop fighting amongst yourselves!</i>

585
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:23,715
<i>Concentrate on the jutsu!</i>

586
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:27,344
<i>Now then...
who should I send this time...</i>

587
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:30,055
<i>This time it's my turn,
without any doubt.</i>

588
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:33,308
<i>Another Leaf shinobi...</i>

589
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,144
<i>Damn!</i>

590
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:39,064
<i>In that case, it's decided...</i>

591
00:47:42,214 --> 00:47:43,215
Everybody, halt!

592
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:47,739
Who is that?

593
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,742
<i>Out of the blue, huh...</i>

594
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,788
<i>That guy... those eyes...</i>

595
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:02,462
Itachi... Uchiha!

596
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,091
<i>Th-That guy is...</i>

597
00:48:12,905 --> 00:48:19,829
Ah, so he is that brat...
who killed his entire clan.

598
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:25,402
It's been a while, Kakashi... Naruto.

599
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,821
You bastard...

600
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,699
First me, and now you've taken Gaara too!

601
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:35,579
I'm going to destroy you!

602
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:44,755
Everyone! Don't look directly
at his eyes! It's dangerous!

603
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:47,758
But then...

604
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:49,635
How should we fight him?

605
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:51,887
Well...

606
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:56,725
<i>Guy, how did you fight with Itachi?</i>

607
00:48:57,121 --> 00:48:58,122
<i>Huh?</i>

608
00:48:58,832 --> 00:49:00,250
<i>Well...</i>

609
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:05,984
You predict his moves by focusing
on his body and footwork alone.

610
00:49:16,074 --> 00:49:18,660
That seems pretty hard.

611
00:49:19,819 --> 00:49:21,863
The Uchiha clan, eh?

612
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:26,273
It's been a while since
I went up against a Sharingan.

613
00:49:27,772 --> 00:49:30,191
You don't have to be that surprised.

614
00:49:30,583 --> 00:49:34,838
There are a few fighting techniques
to counter this dojutsu.

615
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:37,057
What should we do?

616
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:40,018
"If it's one against one,
then you must flee."

617
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:43,230
"If it's two against one,
then take the back."

618
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:44,690
I see.

619
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:48,110
Amazing! Guess that's the wisdom of old age!

620
00:49:48,997 --> 00:49:50,290
Then I'll take his back--

621
00:49:50,315 --> 00:49:51,316
Wait!

622
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:58,495
Are you saying my strategy against
the Sharingan is wrong?

623
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:02,499
That would work if it's an ordinary genjutsu,

624
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:06,837
but it's a bit more complicated
in his case.

625
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:08,797
What?

626
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:11,758
He uses Mangekyo Sharingan

627
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:14,845
which is a much stronger dojutsu
than an ordinary Sharingan.

628
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:19,057
It's not a matter of ending
or not ending the genjutsu.

629
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:27,149
He's a handful... Just who is this guy?

630
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:29,276
Impressive Kakashi.

631
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:33,321
It seems suffering my Tsukiyomi
wasn't a total waste for you.

632
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:36,491
That is not all that I know...

633
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:41,308
After you used the visual jutsu,
you were quite exhausted

634
00:50:41,333 --> 00:50:44,210
and you ended the battle immediately
and tried to leave.

635
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:47,335
<i>But Itachi...</i>

636
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:51,423
<i>Even for you, it is dangerous
to use that "eye" too much...</i>

637
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:56,762
You've analyzed me quite well
from just one encounter.

638
00:50:57,549 --> 00:50:58,675
Hey Itachi.

639
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:06,730
Your eyesight... How much has it weakened?

640
00:51:12,503 --> 00:51:15,297
Kakashi... Could it be that you...?

641
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:26,792
I underestimated you back then.
But I'm not that pathetic.

642
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:31,379
It's not going to work
the way it did before, you see.

643
00:51:32,785 --> 00:51:37,665
It's a huge mistake if you think
I'm the same as before!

644
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:40,639
Naruto, I'll deal with him.

645
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:45,268
Y-You mean more of that non-combat teamwork?

646
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:48,522
No. This time, cover me.

647
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:54,236
To be honest, I want to be cool
and say, "Go on ahead," but...

648
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:58,615
Against him, even I can't hold him off alone.

649
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:18,635
Now!

650
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:22,722
<i>Water Clone Jutsu!</i>

651
00:52:28,488 --> 00:52:29,781
<i>Water Prison Jutsu!</i>

652
00:52:37,323 --> 00:52:38,324
Damn it!

653
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:58,341
These kids are better
than I thought...

654
00:52:58,366 --> 00:53:00,618
I'm surprised.

655
00:53:04,438 --> 00:53:09,402
Now we can fight without
any interference.

656
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:28,163
This blade, Samehada, only allows me
to wield it.

657
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:32,751
I see...

658
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:36,004
Then I'll use mine, too...

659
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:52,646
I see...

660
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:55,523
This is going to be interesting.

661
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:04,658
Now, shall we begin?!

662
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:46,074
<i>Guy-sensei...!</i>

663
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,495
<i>I'm running out of breath...</i>

664
00:54:54,293 --> 00:54:56,086
<i>Tenten's reached her limit, huh...?</i>

665
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:01,548
<i>What incredible power...</i>

666
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:15,395
Don't think I'm done settling
the score just yet.

667
00:55:18,142 --> 00:55:21,813
<i>That guy...
I know I've met him somewhere...</i>

668
00:55:22,841 --> 00:55:24,301
<i>Water Style:</i>

669
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,782
<i>Five Hungry Sharks!</i>

670
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:52,932
<i>No effect, huh...?</i>

671
00:56:07,965 --> 00:56:08,924
<i>Tenten!</i>

672
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,949
<i>This is not good...
She's reached her limit...</i>

673
00:56:15,019 --> 00:56:18,522
<i>I can't be slowed down any further...</i>

674
00:56:20,707 --> 00:56:21,833
<i>I have no choice...</i>

675
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:26,007
What's he planning?

676
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:35,308
<i>The Eight Inner Gates: Sixth Gate
of Joy... Open!</i>

677
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:49,739
What's this?!

678
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:22,814
<i>That stance is...!</i>

679
00:57:29,676 --> 00:57:30,540
<i>He's fast...!</i>

680
00:57:37,853 --> 00:57:39,063
Is that...?

681
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:40,498
Yeah...

682
00:57:42,348 --> 00:57:43,516
Game over!

683
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:52,469
<i>Asakujaku!</i>

684
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:21,164
Looks like it's over...

685
00:58:23,973 --> 00:58:26,642
It's about time for you to come with me...

686
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:29,797
Naruto.

687
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:33,551
I'll go first!

688
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:38,264
<i>Shadow Clone?!</i>

689
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:40,600
<i>Rasengan!</i>

690
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:44,270
<i>This is also a Shadow Clone!</i>

691
00:58:57,164 --> 00:58:59,287
Sakura! Granny!

692
00:59:02,241 --> 00:59:03,784
Sakura...?

693
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:19,264
Kakashi-sensei!

694
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:32,110
What's going on?!

695
00:59:37,615 --> 00:59:39,200
<i>Are they Shadow Clones?</i>

696
01:00:11,443 --> 01:00:13,529
And I didn't even look
at his eyes...!

697
01:00:21,286 --> 01:00:23,950
Damn it... How did I get caught
in his genjutsu?

698
01:00:24,821 --> 01:00:28,394
These eyes aren't the only way
I can activate a genjutsu.

699
01:00:29,578 --> 01:00:32,901
I can cast it with a single finger.

700
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:38,301
<i>It's about time for you to
come with me...</i>

701
01:00:39,812 --> 01:00:40,970
<i>Naruto.</i>

702
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:43,556
<i>It must've been back then...</i>

703
01:00:44,258 --> 01:00:45,433
Rest easy.

704
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:49,604
I won't use the Mangekyo Sharingan.

705
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:55,485
Or rather, I can't use it right now.

706
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:02,075
More importantly, it's about time
you went to sleep.

707
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:07,455
<i>Damn it...
And I was so careful...</i>

708
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,374
<i>I can't believe I got caught
in a genjutsu...!</i>

709
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:17,298
<i>He has grown.</i>

710
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:20,282
But... he's still not strong enough.

711
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:30,061
<i>Damn it! This hurts.</i>

712
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:33,856
<i>But this is... a genjutsu...
I've got to overpower it!</i>

713
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:40,988
<i>Naruto...</i>

714
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:50,123
<i>I failed to kill you back then,
you see...</i>

715
01:01:56,129 --> 01:02:03,386
<i>Why... didn't you stop Sasuke?
I believed in you...</i>

716
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:10,935
<i>You couldn't protect your friends...</i>

717
01:02:12,718 --> 01:02:16,847
<i>I was counting on you...
I'm so disappointed.</i>

718
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:18,901
<i>You always...</i>

719
01:02:19,944 --> 01:02:22,780
<i>You always come out ahead...</i>

720
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:31,497
<i>You always... achieve happiness...</i>

721
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,295
Someone... give me some chakra!

722
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:43,926
K-Kakashi-sensei... Sakura...

723
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:47,555
Please... give me chakra!

724
01:02:54,453 --> 01:02:55,663
You okay, Naruto?!

725
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:57,064
You were caught in a genjutsu!

726
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:58,483
But you're okay now!

727
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,611
We poured our chakra in you
and broke the genjutsu!

728
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:08,159
Now, it's about time for the main event.

729
01:03:08,783 --> 01:03:10,451
Get it together, Naruto!

730
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:13,790
Hey! Get a grip!

731
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:20,671
Naruto, I'll show you how it's done.

732
01:03:25,843 --> 01:03:27,136
<i>Fire Style:</i>

733
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:29,472
<i>Phoenix Flower Jutsu!</i>

734
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:33,392
<i>Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!</i>

735
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:51,994
<i>Lightning Blade!</i>

736
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:58,125
<i>Rasengan!</i>

737
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:18,187
<i>I see... He sure has learned
an interesting jutsu.</i>

738
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:20,450
<i>However...</i>

739
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:25,903
<i>Damn it! I guess
it won't be that easy.</i>

740
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:29,949
<i>This isn't going to work without
a combination attack with Kakashi-sensei.</i>

741
01:04:30,157 --> 01:04:33,953
<i>On top of that, I'll need a powerful jutsu
that can beat him in one shot...</i>

742
01:04:35,596 --> 01:04:38,265
<i>I'll have to try out that jutsu...</i>

743
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:51,304
The Hidden Mist Jutsu...

744
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:54,432
It's indeed an effective jutsu

745
01:04:54,586 --> 01:04:56,755
for making it difficult
to cast a genjutsu...

746
01:04:57,478 --> 01:05:00,982
But it's meaningless against me,
who possesses the Sharingan...

747
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:08,112
Shall we stop this childish game
of hide-and-seek, Kakashi?

748
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,285
I suppose we could...

749
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:19,498
<i>Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!</i>

750
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:37,600
<i>The Fireball Jutsu...</i>

751
01:05:38,454 --> 01:05:40,594
<i>But I noticed earlier,
something's off...</i>

752
01:05:56,243 --> 01:06:00,581
No wonder... my genjutsu had no effect.

753
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:03,376
This is a Shadow Clone.

754
01:06:03,853 --> 01:06:04,353
Naruto!

755
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:06,629
- I know!
- I know!

756
01:06:08,756 --> 01:06:10,716
<i>- Giant Rasengan!
- Giant Rasengan!</i>

757
01:06:15,709 --> 01:06:16,877
A-Amazing...!

758
01:06:18,015 --> 01:06:20,226
Ooh... He's...!

759
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:38,869
What... was up with that smile?

760
01:06:44,654 --> 01:06:46,531
H-He's...

761
01:06:52,883 --> 01:06:54,385
Wh-What's this...?

762
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:58,472
While we were fighting,
I felt like something wasn't right...

763
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:01,475
What do you mean?!

764
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:05,037
It's one of... their jutsu or something...

765
01:07:06,358 --> 01:07:07,651
He's...

766
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:11,527
What is this?
What in the world does this mean?

767
01:07:12,618 --> 01:07:13,827
I don't know...

768
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:16,198
But... there's one thing I can say...

769
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:22,163
I don't know this man, after all!

770
01:07:23,601 --> 01:07:24,978
Do you know him...?

771
01:07:26,002 --> 01:07:27,003
Yes...

772
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:32,897
That's Yura... a Jonin from our village.

773
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:35,968
A Sand...

774
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:37,720
What does this mean?

775
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:39,680
I don't know either...

776
01:07:40,008 --> 01:07:45,906
But... he went missing right around
the time Gaara was taken.

777
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:50,066
Could it be that...
he was a spy for the Akatsuki?

778
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,609
I don't believe it.

779
01:07:51,817 --> 01:07:55,446
He served on the council
for four years...

780
01:07:56,363 --> 01:07:59,033
Was he disguised with
the Transformation Jutsu?

781
01:07:59,648 --> 01:08:00,649
No.

782
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:03,329
This is a jutsu of
a much greater level...

783
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:09,043
The Fireball Jutsu was created
by the Uchiha Clan

784
01:08:09,352 --> 01:08:11,187
and it's one of their signature jutsu.

785
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:14,173
And that jutsu was the real thing.

786
01:08:23,015 --> 01:08:25,768
It looks like you're done as well.

787
01:08:25,976 --> 01:08:27,895
Yes... I'm out of chakra.

788
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:33,317
Well, the chakra we sacrificed was only
about thirty percent of our own.

789
01:08:33,837 --> 01:08:38,300
Although it's a jutsu handy
for creating exact duplicates of us,

790
01:08:38,354 --> 01:08:43,234
the amount of chakra we gave them
wasn't that large.

791
01:08:43,572 --> 01:08:48,035
And the jutsu they can use
are proportionate to that quantity.

792
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:52,795
But it was more than enough
to buy us time.

793
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:30,457
<i>The jutsu wore off, huh...?</i>

794
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:34,837
<i>However, we were able
to buy quite a bit of time...</i>

795
01:09:35,087 --> 01:09:36,547
<i>This should be enough...</i>

796
01:09:37,548 --> 01:09:39,842
<i>Well done, Itachi, Kisame.</i>

797
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:42,761
That's easy to say.

798
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:45,598
The two who became sacrifices

799
01:09:45,639 --> 01:09:48,142
and gave up their bodies
for your jutsu...

800
01:09:48,279 --> 01:09:50,740
were both my subordinates.

801
01:09:52,938 --> 01:09:55,858
<i>You should be
the one thanking me...</i>

802
01:09:56,869 --> 01:09:58,227
<i>With my Impersonation Jutsu,</i>

803
01:09:58,252 --> 01:10:02,381
<i>they were both able to become
members of the Akatsuki,</i>

804
01:10:02,552 --> 01:10:04,929
<i>although only for a short time.</i>

805
01:10:10,268 --> 01:10:12,062
<i>It's almost time...</i>

806
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:18,255
Damn it! This means the real one
is in the hideout, huh...?

807
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:24,470
I suppose their goal was to stall us
and gather information.

808
01:10:25,052 --> 01:10:27,513
Now that we know that,
there's no point in hanging around here.

809
01:10:27,681 --> 01:10:29,225
All right! Let's hurry!

810
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:31,727
This way!

811
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:38,537
Just as I thought...

812
01:10:38,645 --> 01:10:41,607
They were clearly stalling for time...

813
01:10:42,446 --> 01:10:44,990
They certainly have a formidable jutsu.

814
01:10:45,499 --> 01:10:49,795
Using a jutsu like this
to stall us means...

815
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:55,960
they're undoubtedly already
extracting the Tailed Beast!

816
01:10:58,337 --> 01:11:01,966
We don't have time.
We must save Gaara right away.

817
01:11:02,549 --> 01:11:04,551
- E-Excuse me...
- Hm?

818
01:11:05,188 --> 01:11:08,108
What do you mean...
extract the Tailed Beast...?

819
01:11:08,406 --> 01:11:14,853
It's likely that they're trying to create
a new Jinchuriki using the One-Tail.

820
01:11:15,254 --> 01:11:16,505
Jinchuriki...?

821
01:11:21,007 --> 01:11:23,879
I explained before
how the Tailed Beasts possess

822
01:11:23,904 --> 01:11:26,740
a power beyond
human comprehension, didn't I?

823
01:11:27,306 --> 01:11:31,518
And how each land attempted
to use them as military weapons.

824
01:11:32,658 --> 01:11:34,493
The Jinchuriki...
is what you might call...

825
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:38,335
the one who controls that power.

826
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:40,629
But earlier you said...

827
01:11:41,014 --> 01:11:43,850
<i>The Tailed Beasts have
immense chakra,</i>

828
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:46,385
<i>and in the world of ninja were
used for military purposes</i>

829
01:11:46,427 --> 01:11:49,013
<i>by Hidden Villages around the world.</i>

830
01:11:49,054 --> 01:11:51,849
<i>They competed to
get their hands on them.</i>

831
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:58,924
<i>But none was able to control that power
which had surpassed human intelligence.</i>

832
01:12:01,775 --> 01:12:03,777
In the end, that is...

833
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:09,491
But in the past, there were those
who attempted to control that power.

834
01:12:10,617 --> 01:12:12,953
They attempted to control
the Tailed Beasts...

835
01:12:12,978 --> 01:12:15,772
by sealing them inside people.

836
01:12:17,122 --> 01:12:18,665
By doing so,

837
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:21,946
they tried to suppress
the extreme power of the Tailed Beast

838
01:12:22,027 --> 01:12:24,905
and then control that power.

839
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:34,016
And the ones with the Tailed Beast
sealed within them...

840
01:12:34,464 --> 01:12:40,637
in other words, people like Gaara
were called the Jinchuriki.

841
01:12:44,049 --> 01:12:46,045
The striking feature of the Jinchuriki is

842
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:50,574
how they utilize unbelievable power by
resonating with the Tailed Beast.

843
01:12:50,986 --> 01:12:58,035
Including Gaara, there have been three
Jinchuriki in the history of the Sand.

844
01:13:10,594 --> 01:13:11,864
I'm counting on you.

845
01:13:18,685 --> 01:13:22,856
How can a Tailed Beast be extracted?

846
01:13:24,439 --> 01:13:27,878
What's required is
a Sealing Jutsu with the ability...

847
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:32,074
to instantaneously balance
the power of the Tailed Beast,

848
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:34,743
in addition to plenty of time.

849
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:38,645
But if that's done, the Jinchuriki...

850
01:13:41,708 --> 01:13:43,085
Don't tell me...

851
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:47,464
That's right...

852
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:50,676
A Jinchuriki that has
his Tailed Beast extracted...

853
01:13:52,469 --> 01:13:53,554
dies.

854
01:13:55,525 --> 01:13:57,486
The two people I mentioned earlier...

855
01:13:57,891 --> 01:14:00,639
The Sand Jinchuriki other than Gaara

856
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:04,146
both had the Shukaku
within them extracted...

857
01:14:04,585 --> 01:14:07,004
and died as a result.

858
01:14:15,993 --> 01:14:18,787
You're sentimental as always, huh?
Sakura...

859
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:22,082
Don't worry.

860
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:25,252
I'll be saving Gaara!

861
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:30,716
I-I was worried... about you!

862
01:14:30,757 --> 01:14:31,884
Let's hurry.

863
01:14:43,937 --> 01:14:45,022
<i>Naruto...</i>

864
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:04,166
<i>Zetsu.</i>

865
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,961
<i>Dispose of the two we used for
the Impersonation Jutsu.</i>

866
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:09,588
<i>Understood.</i>

867
01:15:09,963 --> 01:15:13,967
<i>Itachi, tell me about the enemy's
number and their features.</i>

868
01:15:14,968 --> 01:15:18,055
<i>They're a four-man squad with
Kakashi Hatake, Sakura Haruno,</i>

869
01:15:18,597 --> 01:15:21,600
<i>and the Nine-Tails Jinchuriki
Naruto Uzumaki from the Leaf,</i>

870
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:25,395
<i>and Chiyo, the Sand's advisor.</i>

871
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:29,107
<i>Did he say Chiyo...?</i>

872
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:46,083
<i>It's from my sister...?</i>

873
01:16:01,437 --> 01:16:02,938
You shouldn't be moving yet.

874
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:04,560
It's not good for you in
your condition.

875
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,686
I'm okay.

876
01:16:06,281 --> 01:16:08,617
I can at least walk...

877
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:12,359
More importantly, it seems we've
been contacted by Granny Chiyo.

878
01:16:12,693 --> 01:16:14,069
I can't just lie around!

879
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:17,698
I see... So you've heard, huh?

880
01:16:18,699 --> 01:16:22,494
As it happens, we've learned
something terrible from her message.

881
01:16:26,222 --> 01:16:27,932
Yura was a spy?!

882
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:29,960
I can't believe it...

883
01:16:30,425 --> 01:16:32,934
A man who served on the council
for four years wouldn't...

884
01:16:33,712 --> 01:16:36,465
But... now it makes sense.

885
01:16:36,971 --> 01:16:40,308
How the enemy broke through
the village defenses that easily.

886
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:42,931
And I'm sure nobody imagined

887
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:46,810
a man in charge of security
would be an enemy spy.

888
01:16:48,729 --> 01:16:52,024
Here I thought we had thoroughly
checked everyone out

889
01:16:52,065 --> 01:16:54,067
when Gaara became the Kazekage!

890
01:16:54,383 --> 01:17:00,681
The person in question might've
just been controlled by some kind of jutsu.

891
01:17:01,074 --> 01:17:02,159
More importantly,

892
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,661
it doesn't say anything about
the most crucial thing!

893
01:17:05,463 --> 01:17:07,757
When's the Kazekage coming back?!

894
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:11,418
Having the Kazekage of one
of the Five Great Shinobi Lands

895
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:15,605
being kidnapped by rogue ninja sets a
terrible precedent for the other nations!

896
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:20,301
And it seems one of them
is Sasori of the Red Sand!

897
01:17:20,888 --> 01:17:23,849
It'll be a tremendous disgrace
if this gets out to the other lands!

898
01:17:24,514 --> 01:17:27,100
If it becomes known that
the Kazekage is missing,

899
01:17:27,275 --> 01:17:31,029
who knows when
the neighboring lands will intervene.

900
01:17:31,530 --> 01:17:34,916
Our most pressing need is
to immediately elect a new Kazekage...

901
01:17:34,941 --> 01:17:38,070
and make an effort
to stabilize the village.

902
01:17:38,278 --> 01:17:41,323
Gaara could still very well come back!

903
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:45,285
Well, the fact is...

904
01:17:45,310 --> 01:17:49,272
it might just be better for the village
if he doesn't come back.

905
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:51,541
What are you implying?

906
01:17:52,793 --> 01:17:56,630
Gaara is an unstable monster
with the One-Tail inside him.

907
01:17:57,673 --> 01:18:01,718
We thought he would be easier
to control if we made him the Kazekage...

908
01:18:02,130 --> 01:18:05,238
But in the end, there's no telling
when he might go out of control.

909
01:18:05,263 --> 01:18:07,683
There's no mistaking he's trouble.

910
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:13,063
Gaara originally resonated with
the One-Tail, Shukaku.

911
01:18:13,171 --> 01:18:16,507
But he's an unstable experiment
we can hardly call complete...

912
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:21,238
He's a failed creation who was even
ordered to be assassinated

913
01:18:21,279 --> 01:18:23,573
by his own father, the Fourth Kazekage.

914
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:30,706
Right now, some of the younger people
just blindly admire him.

915
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:34,552
But the fact is most of the people
in this village are just scared of him...

916
01:18:34,588 --> 01:18:37,758
and have no expectations of him!

917
01:18:39,941 --> 01:18:42,027
Say that one more time!

918
01:18:42,228 --> 01:18:44,606
I don't care if you are on the council.
I won't allow it!

919
01:18:45,512 --> 01:18:46,888
Stop, Kankuro!

920
01:18:47,392 --> 01:18:49,603
You're before the statues
of the Kazekage!

921
01:18:49,895 --> 01:18:51,605
This is a holy place!

922
01:18:53,019 --> 01:18:57,733
Kankuro, your anger is understandable.

923
01:18:58,110 --> 01:19:00,571
But there's an element of truth
to what he says.

924
01:19:01,369 --> 01:19:03,246
But the fact is...

925
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:07,702
this isn't an issue of whether
or not Gaara should be trusted.

926
01:19:12,058 --> 01:19:14,894
Something like this happened
before a long time ago...

927
01:19:15,265 --> 01:19:17,892
The Third Kazekage was kidnapped.

928
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:21,715
There were all kinds of conjecture

929
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:23,759
regarding the whereabouts
of the Third Kazekage,

930
01:19:23,919 --> 01:19:27,047
war broke out and the lands
were in chaos...

931
01:19:27,661 --> 01:19:30,372
If only we had focused our attention
on securing the village,

932
01:19:30,397 --> 01:19:32,315
rather than eagerly searching
for the Third Kazekage,

933
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:33,633
that wouldn't have happened.

934
01:19:34,186 --> 01:19:36,188
Then why didn't you do that...?

935
01:19:42,197 --> 01:19:45,659
The Third Kazekage was
an exceptionally powerful Kazekage

936
01:19:45,684 --> 01:19:47,102
in our history.

937
01:19:48,216 --> 01:19:50,760
And most importantly,
a body was never found.

938
01:19:55,165 --> 01:20:01,963
No one thought someone as powerful as
he could have been killed that easily.

939
01:20:07,385 --> 01:20:10,347
Something like that must
never happen again!

940
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:14,851
That's why... we must consider
the best interests of the village!

941
01:20:19,356 --> 01:20:22,150
I know... But...

942
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:24,236
But...

943
01:20:25,695 --> 01:20:26,822
Gaara's...

944
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:28,490
Gaara's...

945
01:20:29,950 --> 01:20:31,451
my little brother.

946
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:23,044
<i>So this is Kisame's, huh...?</i>

947
01:21:23,461 --> 01:21:25,881
<i>He looks to be worth disposing of...</i>

948
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:28,174
Then let's get to it.

949
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:29,426
<i>Right...</i>

950
01:22:15,722 --> 01:22:17,015
<i>Sasori...</i>

951
01:22:20,509 --> 01:22:21,552
<i>Now then...</i>

952
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:24,522
<i>That should be enough rest...</i>

953
01:22:28,892 --> 01:22:31,562
Break time is over.
We should get going.

954
01:22:36,076 --> 01:22:39,079
Wake up, you two.
We're leaving.

955
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:40,914
O-Okay.

956
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:46,395
A little longer...
Let me sleep a little longer.

957
01:22:46,711 --> 01:22:48,672
You're going to save Gaara, aren't you?

958
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:52,884
Of course, I am!

959
01:23:34,217 --> 01:23:37,595
<i>We'll now be entering
the final stage.</i>

960
01:24:08,793 --> 01:24:11,546
<i>Each team will be deployed
as I just announced.</i>

961
01:24:12,005 --> 01:24:15,592
<i>The absence of Lord Kazekage
is a highly classified matter!</i>

962
01:24:16,018 --> 01:24:20,756
<i>However, operate under the assumption that
the information has already been leaked.</i>

963
01:24:21,222 --> 01:24:22,818
<i>It's conceivable that the nearby lands</i>

964
01:24:22,843 --> 01:24:26,440
<i>will take advantage of this confusion
and execute an attack.</i>

965
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:29,939
<i>Don't think of this as
just an ordinary border patrol.</i>

966
01:24:31,306 --> 01:24:34,476
<i>The teams that are ready
will depart at once.</i>

967
01:24:39,532 --> 01:24:41,201
What's the matter, Matsuri?

968
01:24:42,285 --> 01:24:44,412
Is this really okay?

969
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:46,247
Is what okay?

970
01:24:47,665 --> 01:24:49,793
Lord Gaara has been kidnapped.

971
01:24:50,293 --> 01:24:52,754
And yet, here we are guarding
a border

972
01:24:52,876 --> 01:24:56,254
for an enemy who may or may not come
instead of trying to save him.

973
01:24:56,956 --> 01:25:00,334
It's an order from our superiors.
We can only obey.

974
01:25:00,662 --> 01:25:01,663
No way!

975
01:25:02,657 --> 01:25:04,701
Lord Gaara is the Hidden Sand's...

976
01:25:04,944 --> 01:25:06,737
our Kazekage!

977
01:25:06,924 --> 01:25:10,553
I know that!
Gaara's my little brother, you know!

978
01:25:12,616 --> 01:25:13,659
I'm sorry...

979
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:16,945
This way.

980
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:18,071
Right!

981
01:25:27,205 --> 01:25:29,290
Naruto, wait up!

982
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:31,459
Honestly...

983
01:25:34,712 --> 01:25:39,801
Why's that kid trying so hard to
save Gaara who's from a different village?

984
01:25:42,403 --> 01:25:45,114
And what in the world is he?

985
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:48,601
He's also a Jinchuriki.

986
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:53,356
He has the Nine-Tails sealed within him.

987
01:25:58,253 --> 01:26:02,574
Indeed, Naruto probably doesn't have
much attachment to the Hidden Sand itself.

988
01:26:04,147 --> 01:26:08,184
But Gaara is a Jinchuriki, just like him.

989
01:26:09,706 --> 01:26:11,541
More than anyone in the Hidden Sand,

990
01:26:11,743 --> 01:26:13,953
Naruto knows how Gaara feels.

991
01:26:15,136 --> 01:26:21,934
After all, the Jinchuriki has been
treated the same way in every village.

992
01:26:35,982 --> 01:26:38,943
That's exactly why he feels
like he has to save Gaara.

993
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:42,614
It doesn't make any difference to him

994
01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:45,267
if he's from the Leaf or the Sand.

995
01:26:46,826 --> 01:26:48,995
For Naruto, Gaara is a friend

996
01:26:49,143 --> 01:26:51,645
who knows the same pain as he does.

997
01:26:55,627 --> 01:26:58,300
I've seen many things.

998
01:27:00,089 --> 01:27:03,551
And in my own way, I've learned
the nature of things in this world.

999
01:27:04,805 --> 01:27:10,018
Learning that the alliance with
other lands were for show only...

1000
01:27:10,392 --> 01:27:14,938
I chose to create a power that could
protect the Hidden Sand.

1001
01:27:22,503 --> 01:27:24,797
I'm the one who used the jutsu...

1002
01:27:24,822 --> 01:27:28,409
and sealed the Shukaku inside Gaara.

1003
01:27:29,202 --> 01:27:33,289
After consulting with his father
the Fourth Kazekage, that is.

1004
01:27:34,290 --> 01:27:39,962
What I did to protect the village
ended up just hurting it.

1005
01:27:40,217 --> 01:27:44,908
And now a village I avoided
because I couldn't believe in alliances

1006
01:27:44,933 --> 01:27:47,155
is trying to help us.

1007
01:27:48,554 --> 01:27:53,393
Everything I've done might
have been mistaken.

1008
01:27:54,143 --> 01:27:58,648
Now that I'm old, I've learned
to give up too easily.

1009
01:28:01,526 --> 01:28:02,986
Kakashi...

1010
01:28:04,904 --> 01:28:09,659
Young people have
so much potential within...

1011
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:13,413
I'm so envious.

1012
01:28:13,913 --> 01:28:16,207
Oh no, you're just getting started...

1013
01:28:16,874 --> 01:28:18,876
You're still very much young.

1014
01:28:24,389 --> 01:28:26,015
That's right...

1015
01:28:26,373 --> 01:28:31,545
There might still be something
a withered old woman like me can do.

1016
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:37,603
<i>Something only I can do...</i>

1017
01:28:52,180 --> 01:28:53,890
<i>It's about finished.</i>

1018
01:29:02,211 --> 01:29:04,839
<i>Whose... hand is this?</i>

1019
01:29:07,675 --> 01:29:10,803
<i>Oh... it's my hand.</i>

1020
01:29:14,932 --> 01:29:20,605
<i>Have I... become someone who is needed?</i>

1021
01:29:23,274 --> 01:29:25,943
<i>Huh? What?</i>

1022
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:30,531
<i>Is that me?</i>

1023
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:41,918
<i>That's me... The me who just wanted
to be needed by someone...</i>

1024
01:29:43,294 --> 01:29:47,340
<i>Why...? Why did I want
to be like that?</i>

1025
01:29:48,925 --> 01:29:54,305
<i>Why... am I...
an existence that desires that?</i>

1026
01:29:56,682 --> 01:30:02,355
<i>Those eyes. That nose.
That mouth.</i>

1027
01:30:05,149 --> 01:30:06,192
<i>Why?</i>

1028
01:30:08,163 --> 01:30:10,498
<i>Why is that Gaara?</i>

1029
01:30:12,235 --> 01:30:14,403
<i>I was inside that...</i>

1030
01:30:15,243 --> 01:30:16,244
<i>No...</i>

1031
01:30:17,105 --> 01:30:18,856
<i>What am I in the first place?</i>

1032
01:30:20,665 --> 01:30:22,708
<i>I'm just aware that I'm me.</i>

1033
01:30:23,286 --> 01:30:26,915
<i>What am I... in the first place?</i>

1034
01:30:29,708 --> 01:30:33,712
<i>I'm just a small... feeling.</i>

1035
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:51,821
<i>It's finished.</i>

1036
01:30:57,803 --> 01:30:59,764
Oh man.

1037
01:31:00,246 --> 01:31:02,915
In the end, it took three days
and three nights.

1038
01:31:06,027 --> 01:31:09,197
<i>It's exhausting every time, isn't it?</i>

1039
01:31:11,050 --> 01:31:13,177
<i>Ohhh, my shoulders are all stiff.</i>

1040
01:31:16,835 --> 01:31:19,504
<i>Good work, everyone.</i>

1041
01:31:27,398 --> 01:31:29,477
Gaara is on the other side of this boulder.

1042
01:31:30,026 --> 01:31:32,153
It looks like they put up a barrier.

1043
01:31:33,070 --> 01:31:34,071
What's the plan?

1044
01:31:34,688 --> 01:31:35,898
Let's bust through!

1045
01:31:35,948 --> 01:31:36,949
No!

1046
01:31:40,187 --> 01:31:42,481
You're late, Kakashi.

1047
01:31:42,788 --> 01:31:44,290
Well, you see...

1048
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:46,584
we got caught up in something
troublesome along the way.

1049
01:31:47,168 --> 01:31:49,212
Naruto! Sakura!

1050
01:31:49,506 --> 01:31:54,632
Kakashi... By troublesome,
you certainly don't mean me, do you?

1051
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:56,511
Hey!

1052
01:31:56,969 --> 01:31:57,970
Naruto...

1053
01:31:58,482 --> 01:32:01,529
Now, shall we do this, Kakashi?

1054
01:32:02,266 --> 01:32:03,017
Yeah.

1055
01:32:06,854 --> 01:32:09,398
<i>Hang on, Gaara.</i>

1056
01:32:34,632 --> 01:32:36,008
A barrier, huh...?

1057
01:32:43,933 --> 01:32:47,103
<i>It's getting noisy outside.</i>

1058
01:32:47,877 --> 01:32:51,589
<i>It appears they've arrived.</i>

1059
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:54,986
Which group? Hmm?

1060
01:32:56,254 --> 01:32:58,965
The group Kisame stalled?

1061
01:33:00,382 --> 01:33:01,716
Or is it...

1062
01:33:02,368 --> 01:33:05,788
<i>It's... both groups...</i>

1063
01:33:06,789 --> 01:33:09,458
<i>So they arrived at the same time, huh?</i>

1064
01:33:10,459 --> 01:33:11,460
<i>However...</i>

1065
01:33:17,942 --> 01:33:21,111
<i>They were just a bit late...</i>

1066
01:33:23,055 --> 01:33:27,101
It seems they've got another
Jinchuriki with them...

1067
01:33:30,918 --> 01:33:34,338
Don't take it personally, Itachi.

1068
01:33:41,419 --> 01:33:44,797
<i>Now then. Shall we get going...?</i>

1069
01:33:45,324 --> 01:33:47,535
<i>It's starting to get noisy outside</i>

1070
01:33:47,642 --> 01:33:50,687
<i>and we've got our mission
to complete, after all.</i>

1071
01:33:51,519 --> 01:33:53,395
<i>Exactly...</i>

1072
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:56,564
<i>What shall we do with
the guys outside?</i>

1073
01:33:57,280 --> 01:34:02,536
<i>Well, we don't even know
if they can get in here...</i>

1074
01:34:03,529 --> 01:34:05,072
<i>Don't underestimate them.</i>

1075
01:34:07,656 --> 01:34:09,116
<i>You should know.</i>

1076
01:34:11,849 --> 01:34:17,187
<i>Well... I acknowledge
their brute strength, at least.</i>

1077
01:34:21,201 --> 01:34:22,285
<i>Sasori.</i>

1078
01:34:24,241 --> 01:34:25,284
<i>Deidara.</i>

1079
01:34:27,745 --> 01:34:31,165
<i>You two handle the intruders outside.</i>

1080
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:34,002
I knew it would turn out like this...

1081
01:34:36,253 --> 01:34:39,632
<i>But take the Jinchuriki alive.</i>

1082
01:34:40,174 --> 01:34:41,509
We know.

1083
01:34:43,803 --> 01:34:45,137
<i>Everyone else is dismissed.</i>

1084
01:34:47,890 --> 01:34:49,141
<i>Let's go.</i>

1085
01:34:49,892 --> 01:34:50,893
<i>Right...</i>

1086
01:34:54,313 --> 01:34:56,816
<i>We'll be leaving, too...</i>

1087
01:34:57,650 --> 01:34:58,943
Itachi...

1088
01:35:00,663 --> 01:35:04,667
What's the Nine-Tails Jinchuriki like?

1089
01:35:13,541 --> 01:35:14,834
<i>Tell him.</i>

1090
01:35:18,796 --> 01:35:22,883
<i>He'll be the first one to yell
and scream at you.</i>

1091
01:35:25,437 --> 01:35:27,022
What does that mean?

1092
01:35:27,638 --> 01:35:31,183
Doesn't he have any more
specific characteristics?

1093
01:35:34,645 --> 01:35:35,646
Oh my...

1094
01:35:36,355 --> 01:35:38,691
<i>Well, that's about it...</i>

1095
01:35:44,447 --> 01:35:49,076
You okay with that?
Wasn't he your target?

1096
01:35:51,704 --> 01:35:52,705
Let's go.

1097
01:35:54,248 --> 01:35:55,249
Okay.

1098
01:36:03,663 --> 01:36:04,956
What does it look like to you?

1099
01:36:05,333 --> 01:36:08,252
This is... a Five-Seal Barrier.

1100
01:36:09,170 --> 01:36:12,674
A Five-Seal Barrier
is created by placing...

1101
01:36:13,365 --> 01:36:16,937
paper tags with "Forbidden" written
on them in five locations in the area.

1102
01:36:20,941 --> 01:36:23,277
There's the Forbidden tag
here in front of us...

1103
01:36:23,736 --> 01:36:25,613
and tags in four other locations...

1104
01:36:26,003 --> 01:36:27,421
How can we remove them?

1105
01:36:27,740 --> 01:36:29,450
We can't remove the barrier

1106
01:36:29,492 --> 01:36:33,704
unless we remove the tags in
all five locations simultaneously.

1107
01:36:34,952 --> 01:36:37,162
It must be done simultaneously, huh?

1108
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,001
That's right.

1109
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:42,546
The barrier can't be removed unless
the five tags are removed simultaneously.

1110
01:36:43,315 --> 01:36:44,441
That's how it's been set up.

1111
01:36:45,382 --> 01:36:46,043
<i>Byakugan!</i>

1112
01:37:00,958 --> 01:37:01,959
I found them!

1113
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:04,235
Where are they, Neji?!

1114
01:37:05,207 --> 01:37:09,086
There's one on a boulder about
500 meters northeast of here...

1115
01:37:11,659 --> 01:37:12,993
The... second one...

1116
01:37:13,994 --> 01:37:16,413
is on the trunk of a tree growing
along a riverbank

1117
01:37:16,413 --> 01:37:18,541
350 meters to the south-southeast...

1118
01:37:19,836 --> 01:37:20,920
The third one...

1119
01:37:21,961 --> 01:37:24,630
is on a cliff about
650 meters to the northwest...

1120
01:37:26,191 --> 01:37:27,192
The last one...

1121
01:37:28,175 --> 01:37:31,011
is in a forest a little less than
800 meters to the southwest...

1122
01:37:31,672 --> 01:37:33,256
At that distance...

1123
01:37:34,223 --> 01:37:36,600
we should be able to use
wireless radios.

1124
01:37:37,142 --> 01:37:40,354
We'll remove the tags in
the four surrounding locations.

1125
01:37:41,689 --> 01:37:45,693
If this is a competition of speed, our
team will probably be faster, after all.

1126
01:37:47,695 --> 01:37:50,447
All right, Lee, you head for
the northwest forest!

1127
01:37:50,781 --> 01:37:52,408
Yes, Guy-sensei!

1128
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:55,619
I leave the northeast boulder to you, Neji.

1129
01:37:56,704 --> 01:37:57,788
Roger.

1130
01:37:58,747 --> 01:38:00,749
And you take the south-southeast, Tenten.

1131
01:38:01,086 --> 01:38:02,212
Understood.

1132
01:38:02,543 --> 01:38:04,879
I'll head for the northwest cliff.

1133
01:38:05,421 --> 01:38:09,300
I'm sure that one will be in
the location most difficult to remove.

1134
01:38:10,206 --> 01:38:11,374
What's the frequency?

1135
01:38:11,802 --> 01:38:13,012
174.

1136
01:38:13,846 --> 01:38:14,847
Roger.

1137
01:38:16,098 --> 01:38:18,058
My wireless radio settings are okay.

1138
01:38:20,185 --> 01:38:21,353
Mine are okay as well.

1139
01:38:21,896 --> 01:38:24,481
All right. Team Guy...

1140
01:38:30,554 --> 01:38:31,639
R-Right!

1141
01:38:41,408 --> 01:38:42,409
Okay, okay...

1142
01:39:28,246 --> 01:39:30,039
With the full power of youth!

1143
01:39:30,272 --> 01:39:31,690
- Fight!
- Yeah!

1144
01:39:31,715 --> 01:39:32,916
- Fight!
- Yeah!

1145
01:39:32,941 --> 01:39:34,614
- Fight! Fight!
- Yeah! Yeah!

1146
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:37,183
- And an extra fight!
- Yeah!

1147
01:39:37,647 --> 01:39:38,773
Scatter!

1148
01:39:40,557 --> 01:39:43,227
So cool! Such youthful enthusiasm!

1149
01:39:43,332 --> 01:39:44,959
Hey guys, let's do that, too...!

1150
01:39:44,984 --> 01:39:46,235
I'd rather die...

1151
01:39:46,897 --> 01:39:47,898
Right...

1152
01:39:48,190 --> 01:39:49,191
You fool...!

1153
01:39:51,110 --> 01:39:54,029
Well, it's time for me to get going.

1154
01:39:54,524 --> 01:39:58,070
There's no reason for me to be here
if I'll just be in the way.

1155
01:39:58,575 --> 01:40:00,202
Good work, Pakkun.

1156
01:40:00,678 --> 01:40:02,805
Well, I'm outta here.

1157
01:40:04,790 --> 01:40:07,126
This is Neji. I'm in position.

1158
01:40:10,597 --> 01:40:13,767
I've found mine, too!
I'll be arriving soon.

1159
01:40:17,803 --> 01:40:18,929
I've got mine, too!

1160
01:40:20,172 --> 01:40:21,173
<i>Neji!</i>

1161
01:40:21,974 --> 01:40:22,975
I know!

1162
01:40:24,227 --> 01:40:25,024
<i>Byakugan!</i>

1163
01:40:32,651 --> 01:40:33,986
A little further south!

1164
01:40:35,317 --> 01:40:38,262
A little further...
All right, it's right there!

1165
01:40:38,981 --> 01:40:40,942
Okay! I found it!

1166
01:40:42,202 --> 01:40:44,872
<i>This is Lee! I'm in position!</i>

1167
01:40:45,980 --> 01:40:48,190
Kakashi, how's it going there?

1168
01:40:49,126 --> 01:40:50,252
We're ready when you are.

1169
01:40:53,839 --> 01:40:56,967
We'll use a buttonhook entry.

1170
01:40:57,384 --> 01:40:58,157
Right.

1171
01:40:59,235 --> 01:41:00,903
I know!

1172
01:41:01,578 --> 01:41:02,579
Yeah!

1173
01:41:07,478 --> 01:41:11,604
All right, everyone!
Remove the tags on the count of three!

1174
01:41:12,399 --> 01:41:13,400
<i>Here we go!</i>

1175
01:41:13,859 --> 01:41:17,029
<i>One... two... three!</i>

1176
01:41:21,172 --> 01:41:21,759
Sakura!

1177
01:41:22,367 --> 01:41:22,919
Right!

1178
01:41:42,983 --> 01:41:44,234
<i>We're too late...</i>

1179
01:41:57,697 --> 01:41:59,073
<i>Sasori...</i>

1180
01:42:20,218 --> 01:42:25,264
Now... which one's the Jinchuriki?

1181
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:35,274
You... creeps.

1182
01:42:35,632 --> 01:42:37,509
I'm going to kill you both!

1183
01:42:39,059 --> 01:42:43,434
The first one to start yelling
and screaming...

1184
01:42:44,241 --> 01:42:45,576
It's him, huh?

1185
01:42:46,830 --> 01:42:49,375
It looks like it.
