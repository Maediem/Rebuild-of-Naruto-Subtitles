1
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,441
Uncle Asuma...

2
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,278
Where is Shikamaru?

3
00:01:10,526 --> 00:01:13,646
I thought my mom said
that he left already...

4
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:36,516
Hey, I told you not to play
on the roof!

5
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,515
- Yes.
- I'm sorry.

6
00:01:54,358 --> 00:01:56,110
Oh, Shikamaru!

7
00:01:57,051 --> 00:01:58,136
Oh hello.

8
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,538
I haven't seen you in a while,
have you been busy?

9
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:02,997
Yeah.

10
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,374
Come by again.

11
00:02:04,448 --> 00:02:07,493
Say hello to Asuma-sensei
and Choji for me.

12
00:02:08,312 --> 00:02:12,365
Oh yeah, I need to remind Asuma-sensei
to pay off his tab.

13
00:02:13,303 --> 00:02:15,097
Um... Asuma is...

14
00:02:15,364 --> 00:02:16,181
Huh?

15
00:02:17,947 --> 00:02:19,073
He was killed in action.

16
00:02:23,899 --> 00:02:27,152
Then... the one who died yesterday...

17
00:02:31,393 --> 00:02:32,394
This can't be...

18
00:02:51,831 --> 00:02:52,832
Shikamaru...

19
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,176
It's almost dinner...

20
00:02:57,512 --> 00:02:59,889
It's okay. I don't feel like eating.

21
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:13,610
Shikamaru.

22
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,738
Come with me.

23
00:03:44,114 --> 00:03:45,782
You're pretty forceful today.

24
00:03:49,552 --> 00:03:51,137
You can't win that way.

25
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:52,941
Shut up.

26
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:05,161
Akatsuki, huh?
Are they... strong?

27
00:04:05,568 --> 00:04:06,379
Yeah.

28
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,999
So, what are you going to do?

29
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:21,511
If Asuma couldn't defeat them,
then there's nothing you can do.

30
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,350
He was a remarkable man.

31
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,102
Yeah.

32
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,730
He wasn't great at shogi, though.

33
00:04:43,298 --> 00:04:44,466
Are you sure about that?

34
00:04:45,434 --> 00:04:47,769
Stop criticizing my moves.

35
00:04:47,794 --> 00:04:50,839
I'm not talking about that.
What are you going to do?

36
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:05,429
Well, I guess you're not stupid
enough to walk to your death.

37
00:05:09,846 --> 00:05:11,806
As a parent, that's a relief.

38
00:05:15,505 --> 00:05:17,966
The last thing I want is my son's funeral.

39
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,931
You're doing well and I'm proud to be
your father.

40
00:05:27,168 --> 00:05:29,629
You're sharp and you have talent.

41
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,623
You're capable of shouldering
the future of the Hidden Leaf.

42
00:05:35,261 --> 00:05:36,262
But...

43
00:05:38,765 --> 00:05:40,225
Asuma died.

44
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,845
What are you trying to say?

45
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,513
The truth.

46
00:05:48,489 --> 00:05:51,909
You're pissing me off with all this talk!

47
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:56,314
Fine! So I'm just a useless coward!

48
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:57,790
No.

49
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,234
Then what?!

50
00:06:07,646 --> 00:06:09,106
Just let it all out.

51
00:06:14,446 --> 00:06:18,534
Let out all your sadness,
fear, and anger...

52
00:06:19,034 --> 00:06:23,622
and everything else!

53
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:38,197
And it all starts from there...

54
00:06:57,337 --> 00:06:59,548
I'll always be here for you.

55
00:10:41,554 --> 00:10:42,555
Hello!

56
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,310
Hey!

57
00:10:45,032 --> 00:10:46,033
Shikamaru!

58
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:47,313
Hello...

59
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:51,108
It must have been hard to handle
what happened to Asuma...

60
00:10:52,267 --> 00:10:54,228
I don't know what to say...

61
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,214
Choji is also...

62
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,240
Shikamaru.

63
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,408
You...

64
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,620
You want to see Choji, right?

65
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,665
He's by the hill in the back.

66
00:11:16,283 --> 00:11:17,367
Sheesh!

67
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:39,198
Looks like you dug deep.

68
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,908
Huh?! Shikamaru!

69
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:48,499
Your mom told me to give you this.

70
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,308
So, when?

71
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:18,946
We're going to do it, right?!

72
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,740
What am I supposed to do?

73
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:27,913
Umm... are you telling me...

74
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,045
Then, can I ask you to
do something for me?

75
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,090
Yeah!

76
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,307
Shikamaru!

77
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:48,726
We're going to do it, right?!

78
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:14,402
Sorry I'm late...

79
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:20,508
But I won't hesitate anymore.

80
00:13:22,172 --> 00:13:26,510
What we're about to do is
incredibly risky...

81
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,725
Please look after us...

82
00:13:38,974 --> 00:13:40,475
Asuma-sensei...

83
00:13:42,878 --> 00:13:44,129
Asuma-sensei...

84
00:13:46,673 --> 00:13:49,718
Asuma... Sensei.

85
00:14:21,703 --> 00:14:22,704
Are you ready?

86
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,114
Let's go, Shikamaru.

87
00:14:25,682 --> 00:14:26,641
Yeah.

88
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,008
Wait!

89
00:14:35,295 --> 00:14:36,296
Fifth Hokage...

90
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,544
Where are you going?

91
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,131
The mission order is still active,
isn't it?

92
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,886
We've formed a new team and are
heading out to execute the mission.

93
00:14:47,163 --> 00:14:48,915
I will not permit such selfish behavior!

94
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:55,696
Shikamaru, I will have you
join the new unit I form.

95
00:14:56,198 --> 00:14:59,493
You will go after we've formulated
a proper plan.

96
00:14:59,646 --> 00:15:02,191
You can just send support for us later.

97
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:05,826
Our team has already come up
with a plan.

98
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,333
Enough!

99
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:11,563
Asuma is dead.
You're a three-man squad now.

100
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:14,953
Asuma is with us.

101
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,598
Are you planning to avenge him
in this battle?

102
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:21,253
It's not like you.
Do you want to die in vain?!

103
00:15:21,424 --> 00:15:26,596
We are not that stupid.
I have no intention to die...

104
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:28,470
But...

105
00:15:29,404 --> 00:15:34,159
I can't just back down without
doing something about this.

106
00:15:36,448 --> 00:15:40,377
I don't want to live a pathetic life
like that.

107
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,444
Grow up...

108
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:48,365
Death is a constant companion
to a shinobi.

109
00:15:52,712 --> 00:15:54,171
This keepsake lighter.

110
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:58,958
When I have this, it's as if
Asuma-sensei is nearby...

111
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:03,420
It's as if he is protecting us.
It just feels that way.

112
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:09,468
Until this battle comes to an end,
this lighter will always be with us...

113
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,012
Get real.

114
00:16:12,206 --> 00:16:15,157
You're only a three-man cell.
A squad requires four members—!

115
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,101
It's fine if there are four, right?

116
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,894
- Huh?
- Kakashi-sensei?

117
00:16:19,885 --> 00:16:24,890
I will join as the captain of Team 10.
How about that?

118
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,860
Kakashi, you...

119
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,364
They'll go whether you try to stop them
or not.

120
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,909
But if I go, I can supervise them...

121
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,578
I will not allow them to go overboard.

122
00:16:57,963 --> 00:16:59,965
Fine. Do as you wish!

123
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,812
All right!

124
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,275
Kakashi-sensei...
How about Naruto?

125
00:17:09,891 --> 00:17:10,934
Your right arm...?

126
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:14,700
Don't worry about him.
He doesn't need my help anymore.

127
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,746
Plus, there is another captain
with them.

128
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,415
Naruto...

129
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,463
Well then, Team Asuma, let's go!

130
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:28,672
- Right!
- Yes!

131
00:19:12,105 --> 00:19:13,106
So...

132
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,232
How is Naruto's training going?

133
00:19:15,517 --> 00:19:17,685
Well, according to Kakashi-sensei,

134
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,462
it seems like he's finally
getting the hang of it.

135
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:23,001
But he said it'll take
a little longer to complete it.

136
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:24,788
I see...

137
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:29,585
Now that Kakashi-sensei
has joined Team 10,

138
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:32,421
Team 7, our team, should support them

139
00:19:32,446 --> 00:19:37,618
given our close alliance with them...
right?

140
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,971
You're sharp, as expected.

141
00:19:41,329 --> 00:19:46,375
But, we don't know when
Naruto will complete his new jutsu.

142
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,937
Wouldn't it be better to
send another team?

143
00:19:50,387 --> 00:19:51,388
Sakura!

144
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,317
Tell Yamato...

145
00:19:53,342 --> 00:19:56,470
To have Naruto complete
his new jutsu in 24 hours!

146
00:19:57,201 --> 00:20:00,704
If not, I will send another team
as reinforcements!

147
00:20:01,077 --> 00:20:01,778
Yes!

148
00:20:05,465 --> 00:20:08,676
So, it's starting.

149
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,878
Shikamaru... Let's hear your plan first.

150
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:17,883
Now that you have joined,
I want to change the plan a bit.

151
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,135
I got it.
Please explain.

152
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,847
I will explain by dividing it
into several scenarios.

153
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:27,309
Make sure all of you listen carefully.

154
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,785
<i>The sealing of the Two-Tails
is now complete...</i>

155
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:13,939
<i>Finally!</i>

156
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,983
<i>We're going to
Hidden Leaf Village. Hidan.</i>

157
00:21:16,422 --> 00:21:17,465
<i>Hidden Leaf Village...?</i>

158
00:21:18,671 --> 00:21:22,256
<i>Kakuzu, Hidan, if you are going
to Hidden Leaf Village.</i>

159
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,700
- <i>I'll give you one warning...</i>
- <i>hmm.</i>

160
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:28,853
<i>There's a guy named Naruto Uzumaki
who's a Jinchuriki.</i>

161
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:32,616
- <i>If you see him you should be careful...</i>
- <i>Hmm.</i>

162
00:21:32,947 --> 00:21:34,365
<i>Hey hey hey!</i>

163
00:21:34,632 --> 00:21:37,802
<i>Don't assume I'm the same as you,
Deidara!</i>

164
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:41,267
<i>You're the one who got his arms
stitched up by Kakuzu!</i>

165
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,761
<i>It's better than his head...</i>

166
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:49,380
<i>Hey! Hey, Kakuzu!
Whose side are you on?!</i>

167
00:21:49,846 --> 00:21:52,380
<i>Aren't we teammates?</i>

168
00:21:52,626 --> 00:21:55,045
<i>- That's why you--!
- Shut up Hidan!</i>

169
00:21:55,433 --> 00:21:56,476
<i>Let's just go.</i>

170
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:13,124
I've been sitting still for three days!
I'm about to lose it...

171
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:18,003
Here I come, bounty.

172
00:22:19,954 --> 00:22:23,875
Hey, where are you going, Kakuzu?
The collection office is this way!

173
00:22:24,784 --> 00:22:26,452
Are you stupid?

174
00:22:26,548 --> 00:22:28,133
What?!

175
00:22:28,891 --> 00:22:31,352
Our target is the Jinchuriki.

176
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:36,630
There's no point in returning there
only to walk into an ambush.

177
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:40,627
Let's take a different route to
the Hidden Leaf Village.

178
00:22:42,399 --> 00:22:44,192
It has been three days.

179
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:48,535
The Hidden Leaf Village should have
retrieved that bounty by now.

180
00:22:49,886 --> 00:22:51,596
Well, that's right.

181
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,587
Oh yeah...

182
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,759
What?!

183
00:23:07,027 --> 00:23:11,907
That scar is embarrassing.
Cover it up with this!

184
00:23:13,963 --> 00:23:16,341
Hey! This is my Headband.

185
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:20,123
Oh, you actually picked it up for me...?

186
00:23:20,661 --> 00:23:24,540
Kakuzu! You're pretty nice!

187
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:27,992
Shut up Hidan! Hurry, let's go!

188
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:33,788
Oh! Hey! Wait! Hey! Kakuzu!

189
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,873
Tell me the truth, you like me, right?

190
00:23:37,271 --> 00:23:39,838
Keep talking and I'll kill you.

191
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,074
Don't be shy...

192
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:45,924
Kakashi-sensei, take this...

193
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,592
please use it
when there's an opening.

194
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:49,177
I'll let you keep it.

195
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:50,887
I got it.

196
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,723
I'm impressed at how much you
observed about your opponent

197
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,350
from just one encounter.

198
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,229
But the other one's power
is still unknown...

199
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:04,901
<i>On top of that, you've readjusted
the plan to fit the new member...</i>

200
00:24:05,266 --> 00:24:06,392
<i>It's remarkable.</i>

201
00:24:07,054 --> 00:24:10,850
That's the plan I developed with
the limited information I had.

202
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,910
After you memorize the plans,

203
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:17,330
simulate them in your head
three times or more.

204
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,426
The success rate of
the plan highly depends

205
00:24:20,451 --> 00:24:23,162
on whether or not
you do image training.

206
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:24,159
Yes.

207
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:25,321
Okay!

208
00:24:28,824 --> 00:24:30,826
<i>S-Such power...</i>

209
00:24:34,618 --> 00:24:37,204
All right. It's almost complete.

210
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:41,480
And now... I can catch up to Sasuke.

211
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:44,649
Indeed, you can...

212
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,820
However, you must be wary of
Sasuke's Fire Style.

213
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,238
Huh?!

214
00:24:50,715 --> 00:24:52,466
I guess I should explain

215
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,744
the comparative strengths of the
five great nature transformations.

216
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,873
Comparative strengths?

217
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:02,292
Basically, it means the five

218
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:06,546
chakra natures of Fire, Water,
Earth, Lightning and Wind

219
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:10,258
are all connected, each with
their own strengths and weaknesses.

220
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:13,312
It's easier to explain with a diagram.

221
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,892
There are five main
chakra nature transformations.

222
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,856
First you draw...

223
00:25:21,881 --> 00:25:24,564
- ... the five in a circle.
- Right.

224
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:28,527
For example, let's take Fire...

225
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,947
I'll draw its strength
and weakness in this diagram.

226
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:37,827
Fire is strong against the Wind next to it

227
00:25:39,324 --> 00:25:43,912
but weak against Water on
the opposite side.

228
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,420
Each of the five natures has

229
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,923
strengths and weaknesses
in relation to the others.

230
00:25:50,066 --> 00:25:51,067
Naruto...

231
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:57,013
your Wind Style jutsu is weak against
Sasuke's Fire Style jutsu.

232
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,022
Huh?!

233
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,017
Only Water can beat Fire.

234
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:05,105
Why can't Wind beat Fire?

235
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,899
Think of it this way:

236
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:12,571
wood burns hotter when the wind blows...

237
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:19,269
but fire can be put out when
water is poured on it.

238
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:25,333
That means if you strike 
Sasuke's Fire Style jutsu...

239
00:26:25,561 --> 00:26:28,355
with a Wind jutsu of equal strength,

240
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:31,920
you'd actually make his flames
even bigger.

241
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:39,514
However, look at the Wind's
other relationship.

242
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:43,768
Wind is weak against Fire,
but it is strong against Lightning.

243
00:26:44,578 --> 00:26:46,288
In other words, your new jutsu...

244
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:49,357
will be strong against Sasuke's
Lightning Style Chidori.

245
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:54,904
Naruto...

246
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:58,491
It's a good thing your chakra nature
isn't Earth Style.

247
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:03,079
So I'm a good match-up against Sasuke...?

248
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:06,416
Yes, only Wind can defeat Lightning.

249
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,585
No, that's not what I meant.

250
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:09,897
Hmm?

251
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:14,049
I mean only the power of Wind
can help Fire

252
00:27:14,454 --> 00:27:16,271
by fanning its flames and
making it even stronger.

253
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,764
Yeah, that's right...

254
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,489
<i>I found them.</i>

255
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:46,206
<i>There's no mistake... they're headed
straight for the Hidden Leaf Village.</i>

256
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:53,472
That was close!

257
00:27:53,826 --> 00:27:54,827
Did they notice?!

258
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,384
I think it's okay.

259
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:01,012
Just as I thought. They're taking a
different route to the Hidden Leaf.

260
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:04,920
They're in the 2 o'clock direction.
We will run into them in ten minutes.

261
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:09,543
All right. Let's go!

262
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,417
- Hidan...
- Yeah...

263
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:35,289
- Damn it!
- It's a paper bomb!

264
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:42,929
Kakuzu!

265
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,265
I hardened my arm.
I'm not injured.

266
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,810
Forget that, watch out for the shadow...

267
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,442
I won't fall for it twice!

268
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,068
Hidan, look up!

269
00:28:59,638 --> 00:29:00,972
<i>It's another paper bomb!</i>

270
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,449
Hidan, dodge it!

271
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,921
<i>It didn't explode?!</i>

272
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,353
They got us...

273
00:29:35,956 --> 00:29:39,209
Shadow Possession Shuriken Jutsu...
Success.

274
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,114
<i>I can't move.</i>

275
00:29:45,381 --> 00:29:48,885
You bastard... I dodged the shadow,
so how did you...

276
00:29:49,137 --> 00:29:51,681
The thing I threw is a chakra blade.

277
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:59,214
I bet you know that it's made
from a special metal

278
00:29:59,239 --> 00:30:01,116
that absorbs the user's
chakra characteristics.

279
00:30:01,495 --> 00:30:04,081
Kakuzu, what is he saying?

280
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,471
Idiot! Shut up, Hidan.

281
00:30:07,531 --> 00:30:09,616
Due to the chakra absorbed,

282
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,477
it exhibits power based
on the user's jutsu.

283
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,938
Basically, the chakra blade itself

284
00:30:14,963 --> 00:30:17,841
is exhibiting my Shadow Possession Jutsu.

285
00:30:18,688 --> 00:30:22,859
That chakra blade is a memento
of Asuma, the man you killed.

286
00:30:24,682 --> 00:30:26,934
35 million ryo, huh...?

287
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,954
<i>He's pretty clever.</i>

288
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,674
Well, let's finish this.

289
00:30:43,303 --> 00:30:46,389
Hey!
Why the hell have you been so quiet?!

290
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,556
What are you doing getting caught in it,
too?!

291
00:30:49,965 --> 00:30:51,369
Hey! Hey! Hey!

292
00:30:51,394 --> 00:30:54,147
Seriously, aren't we
totally screwed here?!

293
00:30:55,156 --> 00:30:56,157
Screwed?

294
00:30:56,525 --> 00:30:57,776
According to my plan,

295
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:01,276
it was over the moment I caught you.

296
00:31:08,273 --> 00:31:09,483
<i>You did a good job...</i>

297
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:15,874
You bastard...

298
00:31:21,281 --> 00:31:24,785
I'm not going to mess up
the order this time.

299
00:31:29,331 --> 00:31:30,332
Damn it!

300
00:31:44,349 --> 00:31:46,560
I know your face now!

301
00:31:47,133 --> 00:31:50,303
No matter what happens to me,
I'm going to kill you.

302
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,307
You're stupid, aren't you?

303
00:31:58,239 --> 00:31:59,782
Kakuzu! Dodge it!

304
00:32:03,987 --> 00:32:05,071
All right!

305
00:32:16,775 --> 00:32:18,276
<i>Just what I'd expect
of the Akatsuki.</i>

306
00:32:18,716 --> 00:32:21,051
<i>They all use insane abilities!</i>

307
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,747
You said we were finished,

308
00:32:24,823 --> 00:32:27,992
but you still don't know
what I'm capable of.

309
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:32,456
So you kept your distance when you
made your next move.

310
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,745
You're intelligent, unlike my partner.

311
00:32:37,521 --> 00:32:40,607
But even if you analyze the fight,

312
00:32:40,632 --> 00:32:43,552
it doesn't mean everything
will go as planned.

313
00:32:43,821 --> 00:32:47,699
Kakuzu! What do you mean
"unlike my partner"?

314
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,426
Just as I said, you idiot.

315
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,348
Damn it! My body...!

316
00:32:56,429 --> 00:32:58,347
Kakuzu, do something!

317
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,992
I can't believe you're forcing me back.

318
00:33:03,864 --> 00:33:04,865
<i>Crap!</i>

319
00:33:05,097 --> 00:33:06,181
<i>Now, Choji!</i>

320
00:33:10,004 --> 00:33:12,381
<i>Spiky Human Boulder!</i>

321
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,909
Kakuzu!

322
00:33:19,758 --> 00:33:21,051
What's going on?

323
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,712
I knew it.
It's just as Raido-senpai said...

324
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:38,307
It might be a jutsu
for hardening his body.

325
00:33:38,686 --> 00:33:40,855
That's his power...

326
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,293
Nice analysis...

327
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:48,960
That's right.
No physical attack will work on me.

328
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,241
It can't be...

329
00:33:55,626 --> 00:33:58,504
You snuck up behind me...
without me sensing you...

330
00:34:01,588 --> 00:34:02,965
Too bad...

331
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,127
What?! What's up with that?!

332
00:34:06,582 --> 00:34:10,127
I thought physical attacks
weren't supposed to work on you!

333
00:34:11,337 --> 00:34:12,880
I saw everything.

334
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,678
I saw the jutsu you use
for hardening your body.

335
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,722
Judging from how you formed
your seal earlier,

336
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,807
I'd say you've got an
Earth change in chakra nature.

337
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:25,521
In that instant...
you read the speed of my seal?

338
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:28,357
And using Lightning Style at this level...

339
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:32,904
I see!
You're... Sharingan Kakashi...

340
00:34:33,832 --> 00:34:35,667
Earth is weak against Lightning...

341
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:40,078
We're not a good match-up...
You're finished.

342
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,331
<i>Kakashi-sensei is amazing, as expected!</i>

343
00:34:43,604 --> 00:34:45,981
<i>Now all that's left is the other one!</i>

344
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:50,004
In an instant...
Just what I'd expect from Kakashi-sensei!

345
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:54,383
Yeah. We needed to take care
of the mortal one first...

346
00:34:54,557 --> 00:34:56,059
It'd be trouble, after all.

347
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,347
Are you okay, Shikamaru?

348
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:02,725
This isn't looking good.

349
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,519
Kakashi-sensei!

350
00:35:06,191 --> 00:35:08,110
<i>His Shadow Possession
has reached its limit, huh?</i>

351
00:35:17,644 --> 00:35:19,563
He nailed your heart in one shot?

352
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,370
How can you get hammered
right off the bat like that?!

353
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:23,579
For crying out loud...

354
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,125
You're next.

355
00:35:47,337 --> 00:35:48,505
Oh, boy.

356
00:35:49,073 --> 00:35:52,701
And here you acted all cool and
said, "You're finished."

357
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,613
<i>What's going on...?</i>

358
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,285
<i>I'm sure I didn't miss the vital spot.</i>

359
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,788
All right, let's settle this right now.

360
00:36:06,575 --> 00:36:08,119
I intend to!

361
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:35,484
Hey, Shikamaru.
What's happening?

362
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:40,865
And why didn't he die even though...
the Lightning Blade nailed him?

363
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:44,744
Who knows...?

364
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:50,499
But with these guys, nothing would
surprise me at this point.

365
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,128
Oh, boy...

366
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,924
I can finally move...

367
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,219
<i>What are... those?</i>

368
00:37:01,972 --> 00:37:05,433
Now... shall we do this, Kakuzu?

369
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:06,849
Sure...

370
00:37:12,433 --> 00:37:15,470
Lord Jashin! Watch me!

371
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:19,111
I'm going to get serious! I mean it!

372
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:21,930
I'll rip out their guts!

373
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:39,840
Kakuzu! Hey! Hey! Hey!

374
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:44,053
One of them died right after
our verbal assault!

375
00:37:44,482 --> 00:37:46,901
God, you really stink!

376
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,977
<i>Since one of the masks that
came out of his body died...</i>

377
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:56,148
<i>it must've been that mask I hit
with my Lightning Blade earlier.</i>

378
00:37:56,482 --> 00:38:01,028
Hidan, stand down for a while.
I'll take care of this.

379
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,155
Hey... Just a minute!

380
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,951
We've been getting our asses kicked
the whole time and it's ticking me off.

381
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,329
Let's go with the usual.

382
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:32,770
<i>Wind Style: Pressure Damage!</i>

383
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,319
Choji! Watch out!

384
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,823
<i>No way...
He even attacked his own partner?!</i>

385
00:38:46,812 --> 00:38:49,648
<i>I get it! He's taking advantage
of the immortality!</i>

386
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:08,690
Here he comes, Choji!

387
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,935
<i>Lightning Style: False Darkness!</i>

388
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,671
Are you okay?

389
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:44,799
Well... somehow, I guess...

390
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,553
<i>These guys... are powerful...</i>

391
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,515
<i>That masked guy in particular...</i>

392
00:39:54,363 --> 00:39:56,698
<i>But no one should be able
to use such high-level jutsu</i>

393
00:39:56,958 --> 00:40:00,462
<i>unless they are compatible with
that person's own chakra nature.</i>

394
00:40:01,488 --> 00:40:06,201
<i>And he uses Earth, Wind and Lightning...</i>

395
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,256
<i>Fire Style: Searing Migraine!</i>

396
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,544
<i>He can even use the Fire Style?</i>

397
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,306
Choji! Ino! You guys okay?

398
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:35,724
Yes!

399
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,018
Yeah...!

400
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:04,420
You're pretty good, just as I thought...

401
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,429
Kakashi-sensei!

402
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:15,890
Are you okay?

403
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,099
Yeah...

404
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:18,809
<i>That being said,</i>

405
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:21,645
<i>I've used the Lightning Blade four
times while my Sharingan is active...</i>

406
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,481
<i>I can't afford to just sit back.</i>

407
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:27,568
They're using great combos.

408
00:41:28,174 --> 00:41:31,932
And here Kakashi-sensei definitely
nailed him with the Lightning Blade...

409
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:36,744
I'm sure I crushed his heart.
He really should be dead.

410
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:40,247
But what I killed was one
of the monsters

411
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,249
that came out of his body.

412
00:41:42,885 --> 00:41:45,471
We can assume that it died
in place of his real body.

413
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:50,799
It was the same when he broke
my Shadow Possession Shuriken Jutsu...

414
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,594
Something that looked like
a heart was attached

415
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,670
to the arm that had been
separated from his body

416
00:41:55,695 --> 00:41:56,988
and it was moving on its own.

417
00:41:57,973 --> 00:42:00,017
What... does that mean?

418
00:42:00,833 --> 00:42:03,502
If you include his real body,

419
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:08,776
each monster that came out of his body
has a heart, and they are all his.

420
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:12,404
In other words,
it means he probably has five hearts.

421
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:13,072
What?!

422
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,365
How can he...?

423
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:17,701
But he just lost one of them to
Kakashi-sensei's Lightning Blade.

424
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:21,372
Then that means we have
to crush his other four hearts

425
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:24,375
in order to take him out completely?

426
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:25,584
Yeah...

427
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:29,088
You're very perceptive.
That's exactly right...

428
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:34,802
I took each of these hearts
from shinobi I once fought.

429
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:37,638
I can always replenish my stock...

430
00:42:38,165 --> 00:42:40,312
with your hearts.

431
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:42,810
<i>I get it...</i>

432
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:45,688
<i>By connecting his chakra network
to the others' hearts,</i>

433
00:42:45,713 --> 00:42:47,966
<i>he incorporates their chakra natures
as well, huh?</i>

434
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,901
<i>No wonder he's able to
use several different natures.</i>

435
00:42:53,593 --> 00:42:58,139
By the way, does the Hidden Leaf Village
bury its dead?

436
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:01,912
Burials are such a pain, you see.

437
00:43:02,187 --> 00:43:03,764
I bet Kakuzu's going to say,

438
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:06,834
"We're going to dig up the body
and exchange him for money."

439
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:14,174
And here I thought I could have
some fun with that bearded jerk...

440
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:17,052
He was nothing special, after all.

441
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:20,196
You're one to talk, especially since
you got your head chopped off...

442
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,391
Shut up. You keep quiet!

443
00:43:23,942 --> 00:43:26,903
I'm sure you guys are intent
on revenge.

444
00:43:26,974 --> 00:43:28,892
But you're all too weak for that.

445
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:36,572
You all look like kids.
I guess you were his students, huh?

446
00:43:36,957 --> 00:43:42,087
Well, with trash like him as your teacher,
no wonder you're all so pathetic.

447
00:43:42,112 --> 00:43:44,073
Don't insult Asuma-sensei!

448
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:45,331
Choji.

449
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,126
Beautiful loving bonds between
student and teacher, huh?

450
00:43:49,387 --> 00:43:50,972
Heh, how stupid!

451
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:52,588
You jerk...!

452
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:53,589
Choji!

453
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:56,091
What's so great about an idiot like that?

454
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,260
Fatty?!

455
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:02,097
Choji!

456
00:44:36,565 --> 00:44:37,776
You idiot!

457
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:40,304
What's the point of getting stirred up
by such an obvious trick?!

458
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:41,762
I-I'm sorry...

459
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:03,992
Choji!

460
00:46:10,561 --> 00:46:11,417
Die.

461
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:17,505
Little girl...

462
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:35,250
Shikamaru!

463
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:48,764
You small fry.

464
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:02,736
Die.

465
00:47:43,092 --> 00:47:46,471
It's over for you, too.

466
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,116
Oh, boy.

467
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,003
How pathetic...

468
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:46,632
Are you okay?

469
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:47,658
Y-Yeah...

470
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:49,134
Somehow.

471
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,562
How pathetic. You're a disgrace.

472
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:04,149
You, too. How could you not realize
it was a shadow clone?

473
00:49:04,443 --> 00:49:06,528
Uh-oh... You saw that?

474
00:49:07,457 --> 00:49:09,292
Shikamaru... How shall we fight?

475
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:13,075
Let's separate those two.

476
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:16,036
Our best plan would be to
attack them separately.

477
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,172
Yeah.

478
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:19,790
After we eliminate their ability
to do combo attacks,

479
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:23,710
we'll focus on destroying
his four remaining hearts.

480
00:49:24,498 --> 00:49:29,420
If we're going to do that,
we'll need someone to stall Hidan...

481
00:49:30,687 --> 00:49:31,688
I'll do it!

482
00:49:32,061 --> 00:49:34,939
I have the most chakra
stored up right now.

483
00:49:35,325 --> 00:49:38,552
And I won't be much use
in a direct assault...

484
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,227
I'll use my Mind Transfer Jutsu...

485
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:43,031
No! The Mind Transfer is
primarily a combo jutsu

486
00:49:43,056 --> 00:49:46,701
used after stopping an opponent's movements
with my Shadow Possession.

487
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,318
If you miss,

488
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,612
you won't be able to return to
your own body for several minutes.

489
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:51,697
It's too risky!

490
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:56,702
I'll do it.

491
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:57,661
- Huh?
- What?!

492
00:49:57,786 --> 00:50:00,664
We'll separate them after I restrain him
with my Shadow Possession Jutsu.

493
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:04,751
But how do you plan on restraining him?

494
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:07,337
We'll need a diversion, either way.

495
00:50:07,744 --> 00:50:09,996
Then I'll take care of that.

496
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:11,341
That won't do, either!

497
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:15,804
You're finished if he lands a single
scratch on you and gets your blood.

498
00:50:16,102 --> 00:50:17,228
It'll be just like before.

499
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:20,767
It'd be a bad move for us to
approach him and attack!

500
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:24,354
Choji.

501
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:30,318
You and Kakashi-sensei will take on the
masked one. Build up your chakra for it.

502
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:31,987
Right!

503
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:36,491
I'll capture him by myself.

504
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,411
And...

505
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:43,665
I'll handle that role!

506
00:50:46,776 --> 00:50:49,403
Got it. I'll leave it to you, Shikamaru.

507
00:50:53,046 --> 00:50:54,047
Take this.

508
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,218
Right...

509
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:34,633
That again?!

510
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:39,888
Are you that afraid of my powerful scythe?

511
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:46,770
I'm your opponent.

512
00:51:59,008 --> 00:52:00,467
Hey-hey-hey!

513
00:52:19,952 --> 00:52:21,996
Sneaking around like that from a distance?

514
00:52:22,021 --> 00:52:23,188
How pathetic!

515
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:55,172
Too slow!

516
00:52:58,748 --> 00:52:59,749
What--?!

517
00:53:07,898 --> 00:53:09,859
<i>He picked it up...
and threw it with his shadow?!</i>

518
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:18,069
You wish!

519
00:53:18,468 --> 00:53:21,513
If I just focus on the shadow,
a jutsu like this is worthless!

520
00:53:22,243 --> 00:53:23,244
What?

521
00:53:26,774 --> 00:53:30,069
I'm not just sneaking around
from a distance!

522
00:53:38,696 --> 00:53:41,365
The Shadow Possession Jutsu
is a success.

523
00:53:42,045 --> 00:53:44,005
You... jerk!

524
00:53:44,814 --> 00:53:45,857
Go, Shikamaru!

525
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:47,933
Leave this to us!

526
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:49,017
We're counting on you!

527
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:50,644
Right...

528
00:53:56,597 --> 00:53:58,225
Let's take a nice little walk...

529
00:53:58,250 --> 00:53:59,764
just the two of us.

530
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,972
Hey, where are we going?

531
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:30,475
Are you trying to separate me
from Kakuzu?!

532
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,979
You... jerk!

533
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:46,074
Shouldn't someone go with him?

534
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:49,703
You're really underestimating Hidan.

535
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:53,248
And to think that kid, Shikamaru or
whatever his name is...

536
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:56,960
could have become
a high-value bounty someday.

537
00:54:57,769 --> 00:54:58,728
Now...

538
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:00,672
he's dead.

539
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:06,803
But your decision was the right one.

540
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,599
I'm... powerful.

541
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:19,190
There's a great difference in battle
experience between us.

542
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:22,360
Seeing those headbands reminds me

543
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:26,614
of the first Hidden Leaf shinobi
I ever fought...

544
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:29,868
The First Hokage.

545
00:55:30,807 --> 00:55:31,808
What?

546
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:34,122
How old is this guy?!

547
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:36,166
Are you really immortal?

548
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:40,670
No. True immortality doesn't exist...

549
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:45,842
I simply prolong my life.

550
00:55:46,035 --> 00:55:50,122
I maintain a stock by taking
the hearts of those I kill

551
00:55:50,641 --> 00:55:54,186
before my own gives out.

552
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,246
So you won't let me get away, huh?

553
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:24,547
This shadow technique...
only lasts about five minutes, right?

554
00:56:26,145 --> 00:56:28,356
And it's just the two of us...

555
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:33,848
That works out well for me, too. You idiot!

556
00:57:34,556 --> 00:57:40,062
I can stock five hearts including my own.

557
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:48,131
Kakashi... I will take your heart to
replace the one you took from me!

558
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:17,327
<i>So the Fire Style...
and Wind Style masks merged, huh?</i>

559
00:58:35,769 --> 00:58:37,396
<i>He's trying to force me
into an open area</i>

560
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:38,723
<i>where he can shoot me down.</i>

561
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:41,142
<i>Is that your idea of hiding?</i>

562
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:08,002
<i>Not again!</i>

563
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:13,383
<i>Water Style: Water Wall!</i>

564
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:25,311
<i>Fire amplified by Wind Style...</i>

565
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:27,689
<i>can't be extinguished with
Water Style alone.</i>

566
00:59:33,012 --> 00:59:35,640
<i>Looks like I'll have to confront him
at close range, after all.</i>

567
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:58,219
Your heart... is mine.

568
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:01,306
Die!

569
01:00:04,472 --> 01:00:08,900
How do you like that?
It's an intoxicating pain, isn't it?

570
01:00:21,411 --> 01:00:23,830
How worthless...

571
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:28,251
Lord Jashin must be disappointed...

572
01:00:29,273 --> 01:00:32,484
Kakuzu must be about done by now, too...

573
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:38,635
Wh-What did you do?

574
01:00:40,234 --> 01:00:43,112
It seems...
he made it just in time...

575
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:51,238
Time to go...

576
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:05,536
<i>Not deep enough?!</i>

577
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:20,677
You jerk...

578
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:24,972
Why are you alive?!

579
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:28,226
I just pretended...

580
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,813
I was dead.

581
01:01:38,409 --> 01:01:42,432
The blood on that weapon... isn't mine.

582
01:01:43,897 --> 01:01:46,775
It's your partner's blood.

583
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:51,290
I-Impossible...

584
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:53,793
Yes, it is possible.

585
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:59,674
Your own blood was used
for your partner's ritual.

586
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:05,555
Shikamaru knew his opponent's ability
utilized blood, after all.

587
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:10,977
He'd prepared capsules
of blood in advance.

588
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:21,738
What does that mean?

589
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:23,448
Anyone would've been fine...

590
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:27,869
If given an opportunity,
we needed to get your partner's blood.

591
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:31,706
In this capsule, you see...

592
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:41,215
It can't be...
When did you have the chance?!

593
01:02:42,387 --> 01:02:45,348
When I pierced you with
my Lightning Blade...

594
01:02:53,213 --> 01:02:56,675
I took your blood at the same time.

595
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:30,182
Heh. That was... our plan all along.

596
01:03:30,613 --> 01:03:32,072
You bastard...!

597
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:34,727
No way...

598
01:03:35,953 --> 01:03:39,373
That kid... He planned that far ahead...

599
01:03:40,093 --> 01:03:41,219
That's about the size of it.

600
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:44,320
You should've handled him
more carefully...

601
01:03:44,761 --> 01:03:47,680
You guys really underestimated him.

602
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:52,954
There's no way he would
let the information

603
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:56,123
that cost Asuma his own life
go to waste.

604
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:02,380
You people who take lives without
a second thought

605
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:05,424
could probably never understand
how he feels.

606
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:10,972
Kakashi-sensei!

607
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:12,265
Are you okay?

608
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:14,767
Yeah... somehow.

609
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:18,437
Slowly! Make sure not to damage
the vessels.

610
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:20,815
I'll treat you immediately
with my medical ninjutsu.

611
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:23,150
The treatment can wait!

612
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:25,611
What?!

613
01:04:25,891 --> 01:04:26,892
Here they come!

614
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:33,661
<i>Expansion Jutsu!</i>

615
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:37,123
<i>Super Slap!</i>

616
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:54,713
What?!

617
01:05:22,209 --> 01:05:26,130
Two of my hearts... gone.

618
01:05:28,471 --> 01:05:32,058
It's been a long time...
since that happened...

619
01:05:33,692 --> 01:05:36,862
Even I can tell,
and I'm not all that bright...

620
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:39,560
You've used it so many times already.

621
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:45,274
Any idiot could figure out your jutsu
after seeing it so many times.

622
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:47,318
What did you say?

623
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:51,739
It seems your jutsu isn't as strong
as it was before.

624
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:55,117
I didn't even need five minutes...

625
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,662
I can move!

626
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:08,089
The endurance of your jutsu power
and its effect

627
01:06:08,169 --> 01:06:13,383
gradually decreases each time
you use it.

628
01:06:18,822 --> 01:06:30,371
Basically, the longer you use it,
the weaker it gets.

629
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:39,078
You're just about out of chakra,
aren't you?!

630
01:06:56,423 --> 01:06:59,635
You won't get away... this time.

631
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:02,018
Here he comes!

632
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:03,144
- Right!
- Right!

633
01:07:06,063 --> 01:07:07,064
<i>He's fast!</i>

634
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:09,108
Damn it!

635
01:07:09,141 --> 01:07:10,142
<i>I can't move...!</i>

636
01:07:14,133 --> 01:07:15,634
Kakashi Hatake...

637
01:07:16,907 --> 01:07:21,662
I was going to replace the hearts
I lost with yours...

638
01:07:22,955 --> 01:07:24,623
But I've changed my mind...

639
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:31,172
I can get more hearts
anytime I want, after all...

640
01:07:33,966 --> 01:07:34,967
Die!

641
01:07:42,683 --> 01:07:44,643
<i>Wind Style: Rasengan!</i>

642
01:07:44,867 --> 01:07:46,451
<i>Water Style: Ripping Torrent!</i>

643
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:48,939
<i>Hurricane Vortex Jutsu!</i>

644
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:12,546
Sorry... we're late.

645
01:08:17,718 --> 01:08:19,053
Perfect timing...

646
01:08:20,304 --> 01:08:23,599
I've never seen you this beaten up.

647
01:08:23,974 --> 01:08:25,309
Sorry about that.

648
01:08:26,965 --> 01:08:30,218
This enemy... must be pretty strong.

649
01:08:32,345 --> 01:08:35,057
More strange people...

650
01:08:35,859 --> 01:08:37,820
And he looks pretty banged up already...

651
01:08:38,864 --> 01:08:41,283
Naruto, are you okay?

652
01:08:41,575 --> 01:08:42,576
Where is Shikamaru?

653
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:45,746
He's a little ways from here,
fighting the other one.

654
01:08:46,298 --> 01:08:48,383
I want two of you to
head towards Shikamaru.

655
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:51,210
Preferably, a long-range fighter
and a medic.

656
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:57,383
I'll take care of it.

657
01:08:57,716 --> 01:08:58,717
All right!

658
01:08:58,845 --> 01:09:02,640
Sai and Sakura follow Pakkun's lead
and support Shikamaru!

659
01:09:03,168 --> 01:09:03,866
Yes!

660
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:05,319
Yes.

661
01:09:05,599 --> 01:09:08,477
Huh! What's this disorganized mob
planning to do?

662
01:09:08,769 --> 01:09:12,314
Now there are more hearts for me
to choose from.

663
01:09:17,361 --> 01:09:19,864
From here on, this one's mine.

664
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,414
Did you... complete it?

665
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:30,541
No... only about 50 percent.

666
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:33,335
I see...

667
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:36,255
But...

668
01:09:41,343 --> 01:09:42,887
Well, just watch.

669
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:46,056
Naruto is not the same person
he used to be.

670
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:50,019
Multiple shadow clones...

671
01:09:50,449 --> 01:09:54,327
I see... You are the
Nine-Tails Jinchuriki.

672
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:58,694
What's the situation?
What are the enemy's abilities?

673
01:10:00,047 --> 01:10:01,548
The enemy is two Akatsuki.

674
01:10:02,578 --> 01:10:05,873
As I said before,
Shikamaru is fighting one of them...

675
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:08,954
and the other one is in front of us.

676
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:11,874
This guy has the power to split.

677
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:17,087
Those two masks on the shoulders
split from the torso.

678
01:10:17,619 --> 01:10:21,539
Each mask has a separate heart
and moves independently.

679
01:10:22,732 --> 01:10:28,738
He originally had five hearts.
He lost two and has only three now.

680
01:10:30,137 --> 01:10:31,388
What do you mean?

681
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:34,313
We've killed him twice already.

682
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:38,317
We need to kill him three more times
to finish him off.

683
01:10:39,566 --> 01:10:41,735
Plus, he's a mid-to-long-range fighter

684
01:10:42,017 --> 01:10:44,269
and can use jutsu from multiple
chakra natures.

685
01:10:45,115 --> 01:10:47,618
<i>No wonder you were
having a hard time...</i>

686
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:49,443
Naruto!

687
01:10:50,498 --> 01:10:52,167
I heard it!

688
01:10:52,539 --> 01:10:53,540
Naruto!

689
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:56,001
It's no use charging in recklessly!

690
01:11:05,175 --> 01:11:08,579
You can only make shadow clones?
You can't beat me with that.

691
01:11:10,661 --> 01:11:13,539
<i>Based on his attack speed
and fighting style,</i>

692
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:17,815
<i>I need at least three shadow clones
to distract him.</i>

693
01:11:18,649 --> 01:11:23,737
<i>He's gathering experience from each
clone and processing it in real time...</i>

694
01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:26,939
<i>and using it to simulate the battle.</i>

695
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:31,370
<i>His ability to use
shadow clones has advanced.</i>

696
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,794
<i>Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

697
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:50,014
What's... that?

698
01:11:50,499 --> 01:11:55,379
Such a... high-pitched sound
from his chakra!

699
01:11:55,833 --> 01:11:58,002
What... are they...?

700
01:12:04,111 --> 01:12:09,199
All right... To test its ability, let's
collide it with my Rasengan. Get ready.

701
01:12:09,231 --> 01:12:13,401
What?! If we do that,
what's going to happen?

702
01:12:13,924 --> 01:12:18,762
If the jutsu is near completion,
my Rasengan will have no effect.

703
01:12:34,391 --> 01:12:35,476
<i>The Fourth...?!</i>

704
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:52,576
<i>What... is that jutsu...?!</i>

705
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:57,831
<i>If I get hit by that... then I'm...
definitely doomed.</i>

706
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:03,754
<i>Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken!</i>

707
01:13:10,759 --> 01:13:12,552
This is the end!

708
01:13:13,286 --> 01:13:14,287
- Yes!
- Yes!

709
01:13:20,348 --> 01:13:21,807
I'll back him up, too!

710
01:13:21,832 --> 01:13:22,833
No!

711
01:13:23,357 --> 01:13:26,110
Don't get close to Naruto,
or you'll also get caught!

712
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:32,825
So this is the power of
the Nine-Tailed Fox's Jinchuriki...

713
01:13:33,670 --> 01:13:35,839
A fitting jutsu for a monster.

714
01:14:03,276 --> 01:14:04,277
What?!

715
01:14:19,074 --> 01:14:20,075
Failed...

716
01:14:28,831 --> 01:14:31,876
<i>Always the unpredictable ninja.
He did it again...</i>

717
01:14:32,384 --> 01:14:33,760
- Yamato!
- Right!

718
01:14:39,391 --> 01:14:40,392
<i>Damn!</i>

719
01:15:05,292 --> 01:15:06,543
Damn it!

720
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:10,860
Oh, acting all tough...

721
01:15:11,342 --> 01:15:14,053
That's so like Naruto.

722
01:15:14,359 --> 01:15:16,528
Since it was called Rasen Shuriken
or whatever,

723
01:15:16,553 --> 01:15:18,639
I thought you'd let it fly...

724
01:15:18,891 --> 01:15:21,102
Do you really have to run up
and hit them with it?

725
01:15:21,391 --> 01:15:24,228
Hey! When it hits the target,
it causes some serious damage!

726
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:27,648
It's called the Rasen Shuriken, but...

727
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:30,484
you must hit at point-blank range.

728
01:15:31,276 --> 01:15:36,073
That's why this jutsu relies on
shadow clones as a diversion.

729
01:15:36,573 --> 01:15:39,868
The duration of this
new jutsu is too short.

730
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:42,079
It only lasted a couple seconds.

731
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:43,288
Exactly.

732
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:45,791
You'll never hit the target with that.

733
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:47,584
Not against someone like him.

734
01:15:47,918 --> 01:15:50,671
<i>That Nine-Tailed kid's jutsu...</i>

735
01:15:51,235 --> 01:15:53,613
<i>It seemed very powerful...</i>

736
01:15:54,132 --> 01:15:56,843
<i>but I'll be safe as long
as I keep my distance.</i>

737
01:15:57,233 --> 01:16:02,614
<i>As long as I avoid close-range combat
and watch the one using that jutsu,</i>

738
01:16:02,849 --> 01:16:04,768
<i>I have nothing to fear.</i>

739
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:13,063
Please let me try one more time.

740
01:16:14,611 --> 01:16:16,280
You're against the Akatsuki!

741
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:19,283
If you do the same thing,
he'll just dodge it again!

742
01:16:19,454 --> 01:16:22,081
If he detects our diversion,
we're done for.

743
01:16:23,036 --> 01:16:24,288
Let's fight him together...

744
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:28,959
That's true...

745
01:16:29,697 --> 01:16:32,450
As it stands, it's five against one.

746
01:16:32,946 --> 01:16:35,199
There's no need to take chances.

747
01:16:36,217 --> 01:16:38,594
<i>So... what's their next move?</i>

748
01:16:40,475 --> 01:16:41,559
Kakashi-sensei...

749
01:16:44,951 --> 01:16:48,288
Do you remember what
you told me when I was training?

750
01:16:52,899 --> 01:16:57,154
You said you believe
I'm the only shinobi

751
01:16:57,532 --> 01:16:59,196
who can surpass the Fourth Hokage.

752
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:01,283
<i>Naruto...</i>

753
01:17:03,829 --> 01:17:05,706
I know teamwork is important.

754
01:17:06,956 --> 01:17:09,041
I also know that
this is a very risky path.

755
01:17:09,801 --> 01:17:14,764
Even so, I want to take this risk alone.

756
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:20,761
If I can't overcome this on my own,
I'll never be able to truly grow.

757
01:17:32,747 --> 01:17:33,748
So please...

758
01:17:37,717 --> 01:17:38,718
Please...

759
01:17:40,036 --> 01:17:43,206
don't take this path away from me.

760
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:54,836
Yamato, what do you think?

761
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:56,171
Yeah...

762
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:58,423
You haven't even seen it yet,
after all.

763
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:03,387
You haven't seen how
he's a completely different Naruto now.

764
01:18:10,146 --> 01:18:11,230
Then it's settled...

765
01:18:12,815 --> 01:18:13,983
Go, Naruto.

766
01:18:14,145 --> 01:18:15,146
Right!

767
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:25,701
<i>That kid's going to attack again...?</i>

768
01:18:26,029 --> 01:18:29,824
<i>Just to be safe, I should switch
to a long-range attack style.</i>

769
01:18:49,975 --> 01:18:52,227
He didn't just change
the shape of his body.

770
01:18:52,252 --> 01:18:54,088
He's built up quite a bit of chakra.

771
01:18:54,646 --> 01:18:56,940
It's to counter Naruto's jutsu.

772
01:19:02,487 --> 01:19:04,156
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

773
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:15,834
<i>Here he comes...</i>

774
01:19:16,334 --> 01:19:17,335
It's ready!

775
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:33,477
<i>I can ignore the diversionary
shadow clones behind me.</i>

776
01:19:36,411 --> 01:19:39,038
<i>I just need to aim for the original.</i>

777
01:19:39,945 --> 01:19:42,990
<i>I've got nothing to fear if
I can just smash that jutsu...</i>

778
01:19:51,598 --> 01:19:53,642
<i>What?! That was a shadow clone?!</i>

779
01:19:54,498 --> 01:19:55,499
<i>Huh?!</i>

780
01:19:59,856 --> 01:20:03,151
<i>He mixed himself in with
the diversionary clones!</i>

781
01:20:03,423 --> 01:20:04,925
Eat this!

782
01:21:14,244 --> 01:21:16,287
<i>That was an extraordinary amount
of attacks.</i>

783
01:21:17,109 --> 01:21:19,069
<i>I couldn't even count them all
with the Sharingan.</i>

784
01:21:26,829 --> 01:21:28,247
<i>What a jutsu...</i>

785
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:42,689
- Awe...
- Awesome.

786
01:21:47,701 --> 01:21:48,702
<i>Naruto...</i>

787
01:21:50,217 --> 01:21:51,218
<i>You...</i>

788
01:21:53,037 --> 01:21:54,663
<i>You... finally...</i>

789
01:22:00,266 --> 01:22:03,144
All right... I did it.

790
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:19,935
If you had believed in Lord Jashin,

791
01:22:20,319 --> 01:22:23,614
you may have gotten a helping hand
in your time of need.

792
01:22:25,732 --> 01:22:28,568
If you'll believe in Lord Jashin
from now on...

793
01:22:28,568 --> 01:22:30,862
to mark your conversion...

794
01:22:35,075 --> 01:22:38,203
As if I'd forgive you! Idiot!

795
01:22:42,140 --> 01:22:45,519
I don't care about his forgiveness.

796
01:22:50,048 --> 01:22:51,466
<i>Shadow Pull Jutsu!</i>

797
01:22:56,692 --> 01:22:58,069
You...

798
01:23:04,988 --> 01:23:06,990
Wh-What are you doing?!

799
01:23:08,084 --> 01:23:09,377
Just watch...

800
01:23:18,453 --> 01:23:19,496
What?!

801
01:23:35,385 --> 01:23:38,596
What happened?!
When did you do this...?!

802
01:23:39,764 --> 01:23:43,727
I had this trap prepared beforehand.

803
01:23:44,854 --> 01:23:51,110
<i>So he didn't just separate us on a whim,
but he purposely lured me here?</i>

804
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:55,655
<i>Then... this was all his plan!</i>

805
01:23:56,156 --> 01:23:58,491
When you curse someone,
you dig two holes.

806
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:01,036
You know what that means?

807
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:02,287
What?!

808
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:08,585
If you curse to kill someone,
you also get killed in retribution,

809
01:24:08,866 --> 01:24:12,287
If you're going to curse someone,
you seal your own fate in the process,

810
01:24:16,139 --> 01:24:19,225
You cursed and killed my teacher.

811
01:24:19,596 --> 01:24:22,348
Don't think for a second I'm going
to let you die an easy death.

812
01:24:25,268 --> 01:24:27,645
This hole is your grave.

813
01:24:31,597 --> 01:24:33,391
I am not going to die...

814
01:24:33,568 --> 01:24:36,780
Even if my body is dismembered
into pieces and only my head remains,

815
01:24:36,805 --> 01:24:42,560
I'll drag myself out of here
and bite your throat out!

816
01:24:48,416 --> 01:24:49,417
What?

817
01:24:51,169 --> 01:24:52,170
Deer?

818
01:24:52,915 --> 01:24:56,335
These woods are a special place
in the Land of Fire.

819
01:24:57,092 --> 01:25:02,388
Only members of our clan are permitted
to enter. No one else ever comes here.

820
01:25:05,517 --> 01:25:09,312
Our clan will watch over you
for all eternity.

821
01:25:25,745 --> 01:25:28,164
<i>You did a great job, Shikamaru.</i>

822
01:25:31,417 --> 01:25:32,418
Yeah...

823
01:25:53,231 --> 01:25:57,110
<i>My Will of Fire... is now yours.</i>

824
01:26:16,263 --> 01:26:19,308
You... why are you lighting that?

825
01:26:22,247 --> 01:26:27,127
It's the Will of Fire...
the will to protect our village.

826
01:26:31,294 --> 01:26:33,171
Goodbye... Sensei.

827
01:27:15,021 --> 01:27:17,190
This is a sorry state...

828
01:27:17,815 --> 01:27:20,193
How dare you do this to me?!

829
01:27:32,622 --> 01:27:36,084
Lord Jashin will punish you for this!

830
01:27:36,584 --> 01:27:41,089
A greater judgment will be
handed down by Jashin himself!

831
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:44,259
That doesn't scare me.

832
01:27:49,681 --> 01:27:52,850
We believe in different things.

833
01:27:58,022 --> 01:28:01,067
I believe in the Will of Fire.

834
01:28:02,652 --> 01:28:07,991
My "God" isn't some pathetic creature
like Jashin.

835
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:14,205
Now... I will hand down judgment...

836
01:28:17,469 --> 01:28:18,678
You bastard...!

837
01:28:26,067 --> 01:28:32,615
I told you, judgment will be handed down
to you by Lord Jashin!

838
01:28:34,809 --> 01:28:39,939
And I'm the one who'll carry it out!
All I need are my teeth to kill you!

839
01:28:39,964 --> 01:28:42,925
I'll chew you to pieces!

840
01:30:11,547 --> 01:30:12,631
We found you!

841
01:30:14,725 --> 01:30:17,853
Reinforcements? You're a little late.

842
01:30:18,312 --> 01:30:19,563
Wh-What?!

843
01:30:19,705 --> 01:30:23,292
Shikamaru...
You defeated an Akatsuki by yourself?

844
01:30:23,864 --> 01:30:25,783
You're more impressive than I thought.

845
01:30:31,081 --> 01:30:32,124
I guess...

846
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:40,799
I just had to do this myself,
no matter what.

847
01:30:50,153 --> 01:30:51,195
That's right...

848
01:30:55,627 --> 01:30:57,421
Naruto, are you all right?

849
01:31:00,079 --> 01:31:02,331
Okay, Choji keep him still like that.

850
01:31:06,794 --> 01:31:08,713
Right now, I can only give
emergency first-aid.

851
01:31:09,827 --> 01:31:11,829
But, who would've guessed...

852
01:31:12,717 --> 01:31:15,511
that the original was hidden
among the clones.

853
01:31:17,346 --> 01:31:19,474
You're not up to
Shikamaru's level...

854
01:31:19,499 --> 01:31:21,668
but you're pretty sharp yourself, Naruto.

855
01:31:22,513 --> 01:31:25,141
Don't compare me with Shikamaru...

856
01:31:25,897 --> 01:31:29,650
Still, I'm impressed you could use
that new jutsu three times.

857
01:31:30,359 --> 01:31:32,987
Even during training,
two was the limit.

858
01:31:40,661 --> 01:31:44,207
<i>His quick thinking in making
his next move after failing only once...</i>

859
01:31:44,565 --> 01:31:46,109
<i>His unshakable confidence...</i>

860
01:31:47,043 --> 01:31:49,212
<i>Naruto has truly become strong.</i>

861
01:31:49,879 --> 01:31:51,422
<i>Perfecting, to this level,</i>

862
01:31:51,447 --> 01:31:54,241
<i>the jutsu that even the Fourth Hokage
could not master...</i>

863
01:31:55,384 --> 01:31:58,846
<i>Looks like it's time to put
our trust in the next generation.</i>

864
01:32:00,264 --> 01:32:02,016
<i>He's surpassed me...</i>

865
01:32:03,623 --> 01:32:04,791
<i>Do you feel it?</i>

866
01:32:06,145 --> 01:32:08,940
<i>You're the one Naruto always
envisions before him.</i>

867
01:32:09,732 --> 01:32:12,735
<i>You are making him steadily stronger...</i>

868
01:32:14,487 --> 01:32:16,948
<i>Isn't that so, Sasuke?</i>

869
01:32:23,353 --> 01:32:25,480
Senpai, we should get going...

870
01:32:26,082 --> 01:32:27,083
Yeah...

871
01:32:35,024 --> 01:32:39,278
How could I lose...
to a bunch of brats...?

872
01:32:40,471 --> 01:32:45,101
Well, you're someone who's fought
against the First Hokage...

873
01:32:45,685 --> 01:32:47,687
so we may seem like kids to you.

874
01:32:47,937 --> 01:32:51,023
But to us,
you're just a washed-up old man.

875
01:32:51,943 --> 01:32:56,239
That's why you're on the verge of death,
groveling at our feet.

876
01:33:03,852 --> 01:33:08,231
One after another,
a new generation will succeed us.

877
01:33:22,221 --> 01:33:24,098
Good work, everyone.

878
01:33:24,711 --> 01:33:27,881
The immediate danger has passed,
but the Akatsuki still remain...

879
01:33:28,349 --> 01:33:30,267
Do not let down your guard.

880
01:33:32,498 --> 01:33:34,708
Naruto, those wounds are...?

881
01:33:34,910 --> 01:33:37,621
Yeah, my badge of honor.

882
01:33:38,114 --> 01:33:41,159
We did some emergency treatment...

883
01:33:42,116 --> 01:33:45,328
Just in case, get it checked thoroughly
at the Leaf Hospital.

884
01:33:45,745 --> 01:33:47,747
Nah, I don't need...

885
01:33:47,747 --> 01:33:49,081
Yes, you do!

886
01:33:49,689 --> 01:33:51,233
Don't worry, Master.

887
01:33:51,375 --> 01:33:53,753
I'll take full responsibility
and take him there.

888
01:33:53,778 --> 01:33:55,404
- Got it, Naruto?
- Yes!

889
01:33:56,848 --> 01:34:01,103
All right then, I order you
to take a few days off.

890
01:34:02,444 --> 01:34:04,697
Rest your minds and your bodies.

891
01:34:05,931 --> 01:34:07,016
Dismissed!

892
01:34:16,598 --> 01:34:17,641
Did you notice?

893
01:34:18,027 --> 01:34:19,028
Yes.

894
01:34:19,111 --> 01:34:21,155
You mean about Naruto's wound?

895
01:34:21,947 --> 01:34:23,908
I wonder what it could be?

896
01:34:24,450 --> 01:34:26,202
I've never seen anything like it...

897
01:34:26,577 --> 01:34:29,997
What's the status of the Akatsuki body
Kakashi brought back?

898
01:34:30,514 --> 01:34:33,934
It's already been sent to the
Autopsy Division.

899
01:34:34,638 --> 01:34:37,516
We must notify
the supervising Jonin about this...

900
01:34:37,601 --> 01:34:40,521
Summon Kakashi and Yamato
to the coroner's room.

901
01:34:41,050 --> 01:34:43,302
The autopsy is not complete yet...

902
01:34:43,427 --> 01:34:45,346
But as we examined the corpse,

903
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:48,182
we've learned something about
Naruto's new jutsu.

904
01:34:53,312 --> 01:34:56,440
The damage this fellow sustained
was caused by

905
01:34:56,465 --> 01:34:59,718
something totally different
from the usual barrage of hits.

906
01:35:00,486 --> 01:35:01,987
What do you mean?

907
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:07,034
Every chakra network connecting
his body cells has been severed.

908
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:09,161
His chakra network...?!

909
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:13,666
Yes. A condition like this
is usually unimaginable.

910
01:35:14,291 --> 01:35:17,628
Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken...
is this powerful...?

911
01:35:18,337 --> 01:35:21,924
It's less like a standard attack
and more like a poison.

912
01:35:22,633 --> 01:35:26,512
A microscopic attack that inflicts
damage at the cellular level...

913
01:35:27,763 --> 01:35:29,640
I'm assuming that the Wind chakra

914
01:35:29,682 --> 01:35:32,518
transformed into countless
microscopic blades...

915
01:35:33,936 --> 01:35:36,689
attacking all the cells
within his body.

916
01:35:39,150 --> 01:35:40,526
What a jutsu...

917
01:35:41,068 --> 01:35:42,987
Hmm... Poison...

918
01:35:43,558 --> 01:35:45,310
Rather than the number of attacks,

919
01:35:45,406 --> 01:35:47,992
it's like countless strikes
focused into one

920
01:35:50,369 --> 01:35:53,289
And the user of the jutsu, Naruto, is...

921
01:35:54,749 --> 01:35:56,584
That's the problem.

922
01:35:57,126 --> 01:35:58,252
I see...

923
01:36:03,525 --> 01:36:07,321
Kakashi... This new jutsu...
The Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken.

924
01:36:07,582 --> 01:36:09,333
Forbid Naruto from using it again.

925
01:36:11,265 --> 01:36:12,433
It's that serious...?!

926
01:36:13,176 --> 01:36:16,513
The same condition afflicts
Naruto's right hand.

927
01:36:17,104 --> 01:36:18,939
Although it's not nearly
as bad as this one.

928
01:36:21,317 --> 01:36:24,445
If he continues using
this new jutsu,

929
01:36:24,612 --> 01:36:27,490
Naruto will lose his ability
to mold chakra.

930
01:36:29,613 --> 01:36:32,282
If the cells are disconnected
from the body's chakra network,

931
01:36:32,411 --> 01:36:34,538
even my medical skills
won't cure him.

932
01:36:34,855 --> 01:36:36,982
Be certain to emphasize that
to Naruto.

933
01:36:45,049 --> 01:36:47,009
Is it okay to be up and about?

934
01:36:48,677 --> 01:36:49,553
Shikamaru!

935
01:37:05,858 --> 01:37:08,026
Your shogi partner is gone...

936
01:37:09,768 --> 01:37:13,104
You were Asuma's favorite,

937
01:37:13,452 --> 01:37:15,079
so I imagine you must be lonely...

938
01:37:15,871 --> 01:37:22,002
He taught me so much,
from important lessons to silly things...

939
01:37:22,826 --> 01:37:24,828
Shogi was one of them.

940
01:37:25,798 --> 01:37:28,676
I'd be lying if I said
I didn't feel lonely.

941
01:37:29,051 --> 01:37:34,014
But I can't afford to act
like a kid anymore...

942
01:37:34,139 --> 01:37:36,350
I can't keep crying.

943
01:37:45,885 --> 01:37:49,931
I always complain about
what a bother things are,

944
01:37:50,155 --> 01:37:52,825
and because of that,
I messed up a lot as a kid.

945
01:37:53,158 --> 01:37:56,245
And each time,
Asuma was there to protect me...

946
01:37:58,747 --> 01:38:00,332
Maybe that's why...

947
01:38:00,607 --> 01:38:03,777
although he was such
an evasive and odd teacher...

948
01:38:04,503 --> 01:38:07,882
To me, he was the coolest adult I knew.

949
01:38:12,803 --> 01:38:16,181
And that's why...
this time it's my turn.

950
01:38:24,373 --> 01:38:26,208
When that child is born,

951
01:38:26,233 --> 01:38:29,361
it'll be my turn to be the teacher
who protects them.

952
01:38:30,195 --> 01:38:32,698
So I've have to become
a cool grown-up too.

953
01:38:38,871 --> 01:38:40,331
Thank you...

954
01:38:53,972 --> 01:38:57,600
You know Dad...
Unlike Asuma, you're good...

955
01:39:02,353 --> 01:39:04,313
Hmm... A Climbing Silver?

956
01:39:04,605 --> 01:39:07,274
What you'd call a necessary sacrifice

957
01:39:07,402 --> 01:39:09,696
to protect the king
against a higher opponent.

958
01:39:11,904 --> 01:39:14,698
If you escape there,
then a knight will come here.

959
01:39:15,282 --> 01:39:18,702
So whichever the pawn runs to,
your bishop will be supported...

960
01:39:19,151 --> 01:39:22,446
That knight sure is a nasty piece...

961
01:39:22,831 --> 01:39:25,793
Well, if you're to compare
a Hidden Leaf ninja to shogi pieces,

962
01:39:26,126 --> 01:39:28,087
I'm a knight.

963
01:39:28,837 --> 01:39:30,547
What does that mean?

964
01:39:30,798 --> 01:39:32,675
Asuma said so.

965
01:39:35,386 --> 01:39:40,599
I guess Asuma knew
your personality very well.

966
01:39:44,895 --> 01:39:47,898
Then, who would be the king?

967
01:39:53,149 --> 01:39:56,861
The children who will one day carry
the future of the Hidden Leaf...

968
01:39:56,886 --> 01:39:58,555
They are the "King".

969
01:40:00,845 --> 01:40:03,347
You know what it's all about.

970
01:40:03,372 --> 01:40:05,290
All right, checkmate.

971
01:40:07,001 --> 01:40:10,879
You still don't have what it takes
to protect the King.

972
01:40:11,296 --> 01:40:13,173
You better work harder!

973
01:40:13,924 --> 01:40:15,342
Damn!
