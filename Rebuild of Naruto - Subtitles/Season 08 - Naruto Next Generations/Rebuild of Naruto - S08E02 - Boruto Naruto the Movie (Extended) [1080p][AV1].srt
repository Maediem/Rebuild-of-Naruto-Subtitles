1
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,291
I finally caught up.

2
00:01:04,029 --> 00:01:06,824
What should we do,
Lord Momoshiki?

3
00:01:07,742 --> 00:01:10,119
I thought it would just
be a fool's errand...

4
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,659
Well then, why don't we go
greet our visitor?

5
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,857
<i>Kaguya Otsutsuki...</i>

6
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,524
<i>With her warped hunger for power,</i>

7
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:50,552
<i>she tried to enslave
the entire world.</i>

8
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:55,156
<i>During the Great Ninja War,
we were able to seal Kaguya away...</i>

9
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:57,641
<i>after so many sacrificed their lives.</i>

10
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,329
– <i>Six Paths Planetary Devastation!</i>
– <i>Six Paths Planetary Devastation!</i>

11
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:07,836
<i>However, she wasn't acting
merely out of greed for power.</i>

12
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:12,549
<i>What was the true reason
for her vigilance?</i>

13
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,344
<i>I've been searching for
the answer ever since...</i>

14
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,941
I didn't think that anyone else
could enter this place besides us.

15
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:39,158
I am Kinshiki Otsutsuki.
Prepare yourself!

16
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,048
A stone statue?

17
00:03:34,305 --> 00:03:35,681
He switched places?!

18
00:03:39,054 --> 00:03:40,997
How careless, Kinshiki.

19
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,310
Oh?

20
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,062
The Rinnegan?

21
00:03:51,312 --> 00:03:53,249
What are you searching for?

22
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,359
Answer me.

23
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,862
Where is Kaguya Otsutsuki?

24
00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,948
You don't know?

25
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,784
She's no longer here.

26
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:10,041
You will tell us everything
you know.

27
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,590
<i>If this drags on,
I'll be at a disadvantage.</i>

28
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,177
You are not getting away!

29
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,000
I've finally found you.

30
00:04:52,044 --> 00:04:54,546
It took quite a while...

31
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,879
Lord Toneri Otsutsuki.

32
00:04:57,806 --> 00:05:00,809
You've finally appeared,
Celestial Being.

33
00:05:01,156 --> 00:05:05,577
Why stand on formality?
We're from the same clan...

34
00:05:06,059 --> 00:05:10,521
I thought that the fate of
the Otsutsuki Clan would end with me.

35
00:05:10,624 --> 00:05:12,353
Quite the contrary...

36
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:15,606
The main family of the Otsutsuki Clan
doesn't feel that way.

37
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:16,941
The main family?

38
00:05:17,768 --> 00:05:21,897
If they exist, why did they forsake us
for a thousand years?

39
00:05:22,732 --> 00:05:24,359
We saw it all.

40
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,913
The incident with the woman with
the Byakugan was quite unfortunate.

41
00:05:28,826 --> 00:05:32,538
You endured such humiliation,

42
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:36,085
and yet, you still risk your life
for that planet...

43
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,653
I must hand it to you.

44
00:05:38,257 --> 00:05:40,592
However, this means that
you're betraying the clan.

45
00:05:41,254 --> 00:05:42,964
You speak as if
you know everything.

46
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,219
But you never made yourself
known until today.

47
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:46,996
What would you know
about that planet?

48
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,767
Yes... we don't.

49
00:05:51,428 --> 00:05:53,639
Well, let's leave it at that.

50
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,606
I'm up for the fight...

51
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,528
A Time Freeze?!

52
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:10,661
I'm not authorized to kill
a member of the clan.

53
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,719
Well... don't worry...

54
00:06:12,744 --> 00:06:16,373
Just enjoy the Palace of the Dragon King
for the next 10,000 years.

55
00:06:17,016 --> 00:06:18,024
All right.

56
00:06:18,615 --> 00:06:20,826
Time for me to reel
in a big catch.

57
00:06:22,141 --> 00:06:23,058
Stop!

58
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:25,885
Don't!

59
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,523
We're done!

60
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:07,160
They said it was going to be a
bodyguard mission, and what did we get?

61
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,471
Who would have thought
it was for a pet!

62
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:13,683
It was kind of a surprise,
but now that it's over...

63
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,685
that one was
a piece of cake too!

64
00:07:15,778 --> 00:07:17,363
Well, don't relax yet.

65
00:07:17,446 --> 00:07:20,074
It's not always going to
go this smoothly.

66
00:07:20,251 --> 00:07:21,586
I know that.

67
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,110
Anyway, let's get something to eat!

68
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,820
Sarada, what do you feel like?

69
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,530
Huh? Well...

70
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,574
Mitsuki, is there anywhere
that you want to go?

71
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:32,243
I'm happy going to
where you want to go, Boruto.

72
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,995
Okay then...
let's do Thunder Burger!

73
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,422
They just came out
with a new thing!

74
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,916
Yuck! Hamburgers again?

75
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,254
Hey, here come
the rookies of Team 7.

76
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,174
They say their mission
success rate is 100%...

77
00:07:46,644 --> 00:07:49,605
And they're younger than us too.
Prodigies sure are different.

78
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,555
Well, it's to be expected, right?

79
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:56,893
Oh hey, sorry if I hurt your feelings.

80
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,228
We're just jealous.

81
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,438
Forget what we said.

82
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,523
Still, it must be nice.

83
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,193
I wish I was the Hokage's son!

84
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,238
I don't understand them.

85
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,951
You shouldn't let guys
like that get to you.

86
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,786
I'm not.

87
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:17,622
I just...

88
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:18,623
Just?

89
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:23,778
I'm just always being judged by my dad's
standards, and that bugs the hell outta me.

90
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,713
Hey, Boruto!

91
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,048
Weren't we getting hamburgers?

92
00:08:27,114 --> 00:08:29,306
Sorry, I'm not in
the mood anymore.

93
00:08:35,343 --> 00:08:36,970
<i>Who cares about the Hokage?</i>

94
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:39,727
<i>Even back then...</i>

95
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,479
Come on in.

96
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,023
Thanks for having us!

97
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,192
Happy birthday, Boruto!

98
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,486
Thanks, Aunt Sakura!

99
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,780
You came too?

100
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,323
Disappointed?

101
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:55,451
Well, I just came
'cuz Mom said to...

102
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,119
Hey!

103
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:00,164
Looks like you've made yourself
at home.

104
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:03,626
It's my first time at a birthday party,
but it's really quite fun.

105
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,130
Here's your cake, Big Brother!

106
00:09:08,336 --> 00:09:10,263
Oh thanks, Himawari!

107
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:13,052
Just as I expected,
that's some cake!

108
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,054
I decorated it!

109
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,431
You did really good, Himawari!

110
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,893
Where's Naruto today?

111
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,145
He said he'd be home soon.

112
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,147
Isn't that good news!

113
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:30,111
I couldn't care less if that old man
came home or not.

114
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,823
The cake was really delicious!

115
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,575
Thank you!

116
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,867
– Oh, I'm so glad!
– Wasn't it good, Mom?

117
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,748
Your father hasn't returned yet?

118
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,005
Hello?

119
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,173
What? My husband?

120
00:09:52,452 --> 00:09:53,370
Yes...

121
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,012
Yes...

122
00:09:58,472 --> 00:09:59,557
I understand.

123
00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:09,195
Boruto...

124
00:10:12,469 --> 00:10:15,013
Just like I thought,
that stupid old man!

125
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:19,452
Well, it's not like I had
my hopes up anyway.

126
00:10:21,158 --> 00:10:24,203
There must have been an emergency
he couldn't put on hold...

127
00:10:24,571 --> 00:10:26,740
Look, he is the Hokage...

128
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,544
Oh yeah, I get it.

129
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:30,786
I guess it can't be helped

130
00:10:30,845 --> 00:10:34,391
the Lord Hokage would
put off my birthday.

131
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,969
Hey...

132
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:13,972
Big Brother's late, huh?

133
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,258
You're right...

134
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,690
<i>Sorry, I just got home.</i>

135
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:23,257
<i>Oh!</i>

136
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,783
<i>Are you all right, Naruto?</i>

137
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,520
<i>Yeah, but...</i>

138
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,897
<i>This is for him.</i>

139
00:11:31,518 --> 00:11:34,396
<i>I really let him down,</i>

140
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,654
<i>so I thought I should
at least get him a present...</i>

141
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:41,117
<i>I don't know what kind
of games he likes though.</i>

142
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:50,751
I know deep down they care
so much about each other...

143
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,053
Damn it, it makes me so mad!

144
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,681
You seem to be in a bad mood.

145
00:12:04,037 --> 00:12:05,956
Did something happen
on a mission?

146
00:12:07,229 --> 00:12:11,274
You always come here to clear
your mind when something happens, Young Lord.

147
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:12,898
It's nothing like that.

148
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,194
Do grown-ups still see me
as a kid?

149
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,158
I don't think that's the case.

150
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,243
I'm a grown up,

151
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:28,080
and I know just how much skill
you have, Young Lord.

152
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,334
Yeah? I guess so, right?

153
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:33,919
But...

154
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,797
There are probably others
who don't think that way.

155
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,633
They're jealous of you.

156
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:44,305
You could also say they fear you...
and your talent.

157
00:12:44,817 --> 00:12:46,777
I make them nervous,
you mean?

158
00:12:47,047 --> 00:12:47,923
That's right!

159
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,437
That's why they can't appreciate
your strength in an honest manner.

160
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:54,398
And they make excuses like
you're the Hokage's son and such.

161
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:59,111
It's not like I'm the Hokage's son
because I want to be.

162
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,783
Who needs a stupid dad like that
who forgets his own kid's birthday?

163
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:10,414
Well, people will understand in time
and see your true power, Young Lord.

164
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,793
And when that time comes...

165
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,961
That time, huh?

166
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,092
Yeah, I wish that time
could be now.

167
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,511
Oh, that's right, Young Master.

168
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:24,553
Here.

169
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,224
I'm sorry it's late,
but it's a birthday gift.

170
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,976
Naturally, I didn't forget.

171
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,437
Oh... thank you!

172
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,064
What is it?

173
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,941
Another new toy?

174
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,360
This one's very practical.

175
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:44,240
It may come in handy during
your missions, so please accept this...

176
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,700
the Scientific Ninja Tool.

177
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,083
I'm home!

178
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,793
Welcome back, Big Brother!

179
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:58,139
What are you doing, Hima?

180
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:01,090
Well... for my birthday...

181
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:05,678
Daddy was too busy with work
on your birthday, remember?

182
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:08,280
So, I thought if I started
doing this now,

183
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,099
Daddy would make sure
to come home!

184
00:14:10,837 --> 00:14:11,755
Hima...

185
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,754
Who cares if that
stupid old man isn't here?

186
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,692
Mom and I'll be here
to celebrate with you.

187
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,194
I can invite
my friends over too, and...

188
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,320
Yeah!

189
00:14:23,914 --> 00:14:26,958
But I want Daddy to be here too.

190
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,287
Hey, Big Brother?

191
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:34,081
Do you think Daddy will miss
my birthday too?

192
00:14:35,578 --> 00:14:38,039
Will he be too busy
to come home?

193
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:39,987
No way!

194
00:14:40,332 --> 00:14:40,937
Huh?

195
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,757
I won't let that happen.

196
00:14:44,454 --> 00:14:45,765
Don't worry, Himawari.

197
00:14:46,143 --> 00:14:48,594
I'll absolutely...
absolutely make sure

198
00:14:49,108 --> 00:14:51,569
that Dad comes home
for your birthday!

199
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,226
Really... Big Brother?!

200
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,354
Yeah, don't worry!

201
00:15:03,956 --> 00:15:06,084
Do we really have to meet
this early in the morning?

202
00:15:06,596 --> 00:15:07,984
Okay, everyone's here.

203
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:11,160
This time, our mission is
to capture thieves

204
00:15:11,356 --> 00:15:13,709
who robbed the Thunder Train.

205
00:15:17,295 --> 00:15:21,007
They suddenly disappeared after
jumping off the Thunder Train?

206
00:15:21,728 --> 00:15:23,688
There's a mining town there,

207
00:15:23,737 --> 00:15:26,448
as well as abandoned mines
that are no longer in use.

208
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,720
So they could be hiding out
in them.

209
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:34,138
How many are there in the gang?
Ten? Twenty?

210
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:38,395
Hey, read the report!
It says four, right there.

211
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,814
What? Only four?

212
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:45,319
Why can't the townspeople just go
and round them up themselves?

213
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,821
That's just not possible.

214
00:15:48,237 --> 00:15:50,948
The mines are arranged
like a maze.

215
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,910
They could easily lie in wait
to attack,

216
00:15:52,946 --> 00:15:54,573
so it's too dangerous
for ordinary people.

217
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,373
And that's where we come in, correct?

218
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,417
And that's why we have to go
all the way out to the sticks?

219
00:16:00,945 --> 00:16:02,905
In any case,
we leave in one hour.

220
00:16:03,572 --> 00:16:04,782
You're dismissed for now!

221
00:16:09,286 --> 00:16:12,957
So another ruin connected to
Kaguya Otsutsuki was discovered?

222
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:17,878
Yeah, this makes it the third one.

223
00:16:18,669 --> 00:16:19,851
What do you want to do?

224
00:16:19,988 --> 00:16:22,949
I'm going to check it out myself,
of course.

225
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,512
I really don't want to add anymore
to your plate though.

226
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,779
You can't say that.

227
00:16:29,296 --> 00:16:31,310
It was decided at the Five Kage
Conference, remember?

228
00:16:31,392 --> 00:16:35,270
Anything that involves the Otsutsuki Clan
is classified as top secret.

229
00:16:35,505 --> 00:16:38,499
No doubt, if Kaguya had
built living weapons...

230
00:16:38,524 --> 00:16:42,861
like an army of White Zetsu to thwart
anything that posed a threat...

231
00:16:43,153 --> 00:16:46,448
Yeah... It's been ten years
since then.

232
00:16:46,907 --> 00:16:50,369
I fear that something even worse
than the White Zetsu slumbers there.

233
00:16:50,703 --> 00:16:51,787
But...

234
00:16:52,913 --> 00:16:55,439
If we're to protect this peace,

235
00:16:55,464 --> 00:16:59,260
we have to find every ruin
and check it out thoroughly.

236
00:16:59,837 --> 00:17:01,255
I get that.

237
00:17:01,547 --> 00:17:03,757
But haven't you been working
too hard lately?

238
00:17:04,341 --> 00:17:07,261
You've been going home
even less than before.

239
00:17:08,262 --> 00:17:08,971
Well, that's...

240
00:17:09,054 --> 00:17:10,723
I heard about it from Hinata...

241
00:17:10,943 --> 00:17:13,321
You missed Boruto's birthday
the other day, didn't you?

242
00:17:14,382 --> 00:17:17,594
Yeah... I really let him down. But...

243
00:17:18,355 --> 00:17:19,189
But...

244
00:17:22,651 --> 00:17:24,653
I'm the Hokage now.

245
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:28,157
Everyone in the village is
my family that I have to protect.

246
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:33,620
Dad...

247
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:35,388
Boruto...

248
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:41,253
Sarada, Mitsuki...
Can you go on ahead?

249
00:17:41,837 --> 00:17:43,630
I need to talk to
my stupid old man.

250
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,635
Naruto, I'm going to go on ahead.

251
00:17:49,094 --> 00:17:50,596
Yeah, sorry.

252
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:52,097
Let's go, Sarada.

253
00:17:52,598 --> 00:17:53,348
Yeah.

254
00:17:58,437 --> 00:18:01,523
Boruto, I didn't apologize
to you properly.

255
00:18:02,597 --> 00:18:04,036
About your birthday,
the other day—

256
00:18:04,061 --> 00:18:05,303
It doesn't matter.

257
00:18:05,944 --> 00:18:08,906
You're super busy with
Hokage business, right?

258
00:18:09,406 --> 00:18:11,075
I never had my hopes up anyway.

259
00:18:11,617 --> 00:18:12,576
Boruto...

260
00:18:13,872 --> 00:18:14,876
Instead...

261
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,247
You'd better be home for Himawari's!

262
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,099
I don't care...

263
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,871
if my stupid old man comes home
for my birthday or not.

264
00:18:24,588 --> 00:18:25,589
But...

265
00:18:26,757 --> 00:18:30,177
But she's still small,
and she wants you there.

266
00:18:31,114 --> 00:18:32,454
So, promise me...

267
00:18:32,638 --> 00:18:34,306
Swear that you'll come
home for that.

268
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:37,476
Yeah, I got it.

269
00:18:38,722 --> 00:18:40,471
I'll never forgive you
if you break your word.

270
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,931
This is a promise,
man to man, got it?

271
00:18:53,617 --> 00:18:54,618
Humph!

272
00:19:13,428 --> 00:19:15,305
Like I said,
we're really out in the sticks.

273
00:19:15,472 --> 00:19:17,266
There's nothing but mountains.

274
00:19:17,564 --> 00:19:20,275
Hey, can you stop saying
stuff like that?

275
00:19:22,271 --> 00:19:24,565
Are you from the Hidden Leaf?

276
00:19:24,857 --> 00:19:27,985
Yes. We're here to
apprehend the robbers.

277
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,154
About that...

278
00:19:30,445 --> 00:19:32,739
The situation has changed slightly.

279
00:19:38,684 --> 00:19:39,519
Who is he?

280
00:19:39,665 --> 00:19:41,584
He's one of the robbers.

281
00:19:41,737 --> 00:19:42,571
– Huh?!
– Huh?!

282
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:46,336
Did you go into the mine
without waiting for us to capture him?

283
00:19:46,503 --> 00:19:49,423
No, he came running out
of the mine himself.

284
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:53,260
He was in a panic and
made such a commotion.

285
00:19:53,285 --> 00:19:55,871
We questioned him, but couldn't
make any sense of him.

286
00:19:56,346 --> 00:19:58,473
Hey, what happened to
the rest of your gang?

287
00:20:01,393 --> 00:20:02,936
It's all over!

288
00:20:03,207 --> 00:20:05,084
They're all dead!

289
00:20:05,898 --> 00:20:06,982
They died?

290
00:20:08,326 --> 00:20:11,121
E-Everyone got...

291
00:20:11,353 --> 00:20:14,106
killed by that monster!

292
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,459
Monster?

293
00:20:25,751 --> 00:20:28,837
He's been like that the whole time,
making absolutely no sense at all.

294
00:20:28,921 --> 00:20:31,298
He must've been scared
out of his wits.

295
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:32,925
Save me.

296
00:20:33,091 --> 00:20:34,468
Please save me!

297
00:20:37,721 --> 00:20:39,389
Where's the mine that
he escaped from?

298
00:20:39,598 --> 00:20:41,433
I posted guards at the entrance.

299
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:42,877
But as to going inside...

300
00:20:43,411 --> 00:20:46,289
It's not like
we completely believe him,

301
00:20:46,589 --> 00:20:50,093
but his terror made us
scared too.

302
00:20:50,631 --> 00:20:51,591
It's only natural.

303
00:20:52,027 --> 00:20:53,709
Well then, our mission
is to enter the mine

304
00:20:53,733 --> 00:20:56,931
and find out just what
happened inside there.

305
00:20:57,431 --> 00:21:00,058
Hey, what did you see anyway?

306
00:21:01,787 --> 00:21:03,163
H-He's...!

307
00:21:03,188 --> 00:21:04,856
He's coming for us!

308
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,167
The white one!

309
00:21:08,752 --> 00:21:10,295
White?

310
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,679
I guess this is the site
of the incident?

311
00:21:19,263 --> 00:21:22,266
I wonder what
this "white monster" is?

312
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:24,434
A white monster, huh?

313
00:21:25,018 --> 00:21:26,144
What's wrong?

314
00:21:26,395 --> 00:21:27,896
Oh, it's nothing...!

315
00:21:29,398 --> 00:21:30,691
<i>That would be impossible.</i>

316
00:21:30,899 --> 00:21:32,192
Whatever...

317
00:21:32,234 --> 00:21:34,278
Let's hurry up and deal
with this, guys!

318
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:35,529
Hey, Boruto!

319
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,698
Don't go taking off
on your own! Hey!

320
00:21:37,864 --> 00:21:39,306
They may be robbers,

321
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:42,000
but if they're still alive,
rescue is also part of our mission.

322
00:21:42,025 --> 00:21:43,986
This could mean life and death.

323
00:21:44,295 --> 00:21:45,463
I know that!

324
00:21:45,488 --> 00:21:47,698
That's all the more reason
why we can't waste time!

325
00:21:48,236 --> 00:21:49,028
Hey!

326
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,837
Damn it, what is with him?!

327
00:21:57,796 --> 00:21:59,339
It's pretty vast inside.

328
00:22:01,263 --> 00:22:03,348
It looks like this continues
quite deep.

329
00:22:07,102 --> 00:22:12,399
Hey, you're more irritable
than usual today.

330
00:22:12,566 --> 00:22:15,193
What? No, I'm not.

331
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:16,948
By any chance,

332
00:22:16,973 --> 00:22:19,684
did something happen between
you and Lord Hokage this morning?

333
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:21,867
It's nothing like that.

334
00:22:22,284 --> 00:22:24,703
Although if my dad
wasn't the way he is,

335
00:22:24,786 --> 00:22:27,497
things would be easier for me.

336
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:32,583
You two!
We're going to leave you behind!

337
00:22:33,211 --> 00:22:34,546
Okay, coming!

338
00:22:35,297 --> 00:22:37,841
Cut it out and just grow up!

339
00:22:39,343 --> 00:22:40,527
I want to.

340
00:22:40,552 --> 00:22:43,055
But no one treats me like an adult,
and that's what's making me mad.

341
00:22:44,295 --> 00:22:47,048
And it's not like I'm mad
just for my sake.

342
00:22:50,876 --> 00:22:52,503
We've come quite deep
into the mine.

343
00:22:57,778 --> 00:22:58,862
Hey, come here...

344
00:22:59,529 --> 00:23:00,697
What's up, Mitsuki?

345
00:23:01,198 --> 00:23:02,157
Is this—?

346
00:23:02,491 --> 00:23:03,658
Whoa...!

347
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,786
Could it be one of the robbers?

348
00:23:07,746 --> 00:23:09,873
There were more on this side...

349
00:23:10,165 --> 00:23:11,291
Two of them.

350
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:14,044
So that guy's entire gang was...

351
00:23:16,463 --> 00:23:18,799
Their bodies were cut
with a sharp blade.

352
00:23:19,007 --> 00:23:22,260
The two I discovered
were completely charred,

353
00:23:22,302 --> 00:23:24,846
like they'd been struck
by a jolt of electricity.

354
00:23:25,055 --> 00:23:26,890
You don't think several ninja...?

355
00:23:27,557 --> 00:23:29,559
There's a good chance of that.

356
00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:33,563
Then what was all that talk
about a white monster?

357
00:23:33,855 --> 00:23:35,524
Boruto, it could be this.

358
00:23:36,316 --> 00:23:38,402
Look at these footprints.

359
00:23:38,568 --> 00:23:40,404
They came running from further in.

360
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:41,571
And...

361
00:23:48,787 --> 00:23:50,372
That one's really huge.

362
00:23:51,103 --> 00:23:53,356
He must've been over
two meters tall...

363
00:23:53,834 --> 00:23:56,211
Then that one killed these men?

364
00:23:56,878 --> 00:23:59,756
If so, they use multiple jutsu.

365
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:04,428
Anyway, further inside, there's a
monster capable of doing stuff like this.

366
00:24:07,176 --> 00:24:09,011
From this point on,
be prepared for battle.

367
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:11,481
Do not lose focus,
not even for a second.

368
00:24:37,461 --> 00:24:38,366
The footprints...!

369
00:24:38,712 --> 00:24:40,130
Why did they suddenly stop?!

370
00:24:40,947 --> 00:24:44,617
Was this a trap just to
lure us here?!

371
00:24:47,304 --> 00:24:48,847
Where are they going to come in from?

372
00:24:54,436 --> 00:24:55,103
Above us!

373
00:25:19,503 --> 00:25:20,504
White Zetsu?

374
00:25:20,879 --> 00:25:22,005
Why is he here?

375
00:25:22,849 --> 00:25:24,475
What the hell is that monster?!

376
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:25,984
White Zetsu?

377
00:25:26,477 --> 00:25:29,589
You mean the things Dad and the
others fought during the Great Ninja War?!

378
00:25:29,836 --> 00:25:32,255
Yeah... They were all supposed to
have been destroyed...

379
00:25:32,432 --> 00:25:33,767
To think that some survived!

380
00:25:34,017 --> 00:25:37,020
Still, I've never seen one
in this form!

381
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:39,231
Wh-What are you talking about?

382
00:25:44,508 --> 00:25:45,509
They're coming!

383
00:25:47,739 --> 00:25:48,740
Dodge it!

384
00:25:49,616 --> 00:25:50,617
Lightning Style?

385
00:25:55,789 --> 00:25:57,040
Fire Style this time?

386
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,461
Even Wind Style?

387
00:26:02,212 --> 00:26:05,090
How many styles of jutsu
can this guy use?

388
00:26:08,218 --> 00:26:09,219
Whoa!

389
00:26:15,308 --> 00:26:16,018
Boruto!

390
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:38,707
N-No way!

391
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:41,334
Big Bro Konohamaru is
being overpowered?

392
00:26:42,252 --> 00:26:43,253
Let's go back him up!

393
00:26:56,766 --> 00:26:57,767
Did it work?

394
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:05,400
Boruto!

395
00:27:06,901 --> 00:27:08,820
Are you kidding me?!

396
00:27:14,326 --> 00:27:15,827
Oh yeah!

397
00:27:17,537 --> 00:27:18,538
If I remember correctly...

398
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,707
What are you doing?

399
00:27:42,228 --> 00:27:43,229
Big Bro!

400
00:27:54,699 --> 00:27:55,700
He ran away?

401
00:27:56,326 --> 00:27:59,996
No, he let us off the hook
is more like it.

402
00:28:01,164 --> 00:28:02,374
B-Big Bro!

403
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:03,792
We have to treat your wound now!

404
00:28:06,127 --> 00:28:09,172
What the hell is
that crazy monster?

405
00:28:10,632 --> 00:28:11,758
That's White Zetsu...

406
00:28:12,926 --> 00:28:14,427
a living weapon

407
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,695
created by Kaguya Otsutsuki,

408
00:28:16,721 --> 00:28:20,225
the last enemy we battled
during the Great Ninja War.

409
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:23,937
But didn't Lord Seventh and
the others annihilate them all?

410
00:28:24,312 --> 00:28:28,024
Then what's something like that
doing here after all this time?

411
00:28:29,567 --> 00:28:32,404
I think the answer to that
lies deeper inside.

412
00:28:33,029 --> 00:28:34,030
Mitsuki?

413
00:28:34,114 --> 00:28:35,323
When did you—?

414
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,127
What is this?

415
00:28:47,168 --> 00:28:48,169
O-Oh...

416
00:28:49,087 --> 00:28:53,383
A relic of the Otsutsuki Clan
in a place like this?

417
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:58,346
Long ago, Kaguya Otsutsuki
had used the roots

418
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:01,558
of the Divine Tree just like this
to cultivate countless White Zetsu.

419
00:29:03,172 --> 00:29:04,757
But I've never seen anything
about that form...

420
00:29:04,967 --> 00:29:07,094
in any of the data
about White Zetsu.

421
00:29:07,731 --> 00:29:09,232
Its intellect seemed low.

422
00:29:09,482 --> 00:29:11,526
On the other hand,
its strength is off the charts.

423
00:29:14,988 --> 00:29:17,866
Maybe it underwent a change
while it was left alone?

424
00:29:18,616 --> 00:29:19,617
Wait a minute!

425
00:29:19,993 --> 00:29:23,413
Does that mean there are
lots more like him under us?

426
00:29:23,621 --> 00:29:24,622
Wh-What?

427
00:29:24,664 --> 00:29:26,458
That's really bad!

428
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:28,960
No, I don't think
there are any more.

429
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:31,087
Why not, Mitsuki?

430
00:29:31,814 --> 00:29:34,067
It's been nearly ten years
since it lost its master.

431
00:29:34,802 --> 00:29:38,347
That bud is dried up,
and I don't think it's even active.

432
00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:42,557
Without a chakra supply,
they can't stay incubated.

433
00:29:43,433 --> 00:29:44,434
I hope that's the case...

434
00:29:45,018 --> 00:29:48,021
Mitsuki, you seem to know a lot.

435
00:29:48,646 --> 00:29:50,648
My parent taught me.

436
00:29:51,566 --> 00:29:54,027
Okay then, let's go down there.

437
00:29:54,486 --> 00:29:55,487
Boruto?

438
00:29:55,528 --> 00:29:58,948
Well, we can't ignore
that thing just now.

439
00:29:59,157 --> 00:30:01,493
You talk like it's going to be
an easy task...

440
00:30:01,532 --> 00:30:04,744
Besides, if this is the factory
where those monsters are made,

441
00:30:05,455 --> 00:30:07,123
we have to destroy it completely.

442
00:30:07,332 --> 00:30:09,292
That may be true, but...

443
00:30:10,005 --> 00:30:11,173
Hey, Big Bro Konohamaru!

444
00:30:11,503 --> 00:30:13,588
Let's get that thing.
Together, the four of us!

445
00:30:13,836 --> 00:30:16,463
Boruto, that makes a lot of sense.

446
00:30:16,941 --> 00:30:18,067
However, I have to reject it.

447
00:30:18,092 --> 00:30:19,761
Wh-Why?!

448
00:30:20,053 --> 00:30:22,680
This place definitely seems
to be inactive.

449
00:30:23,097 --> 00:30:25,475
But if that's the case,
why is that White Zetsu here?

450
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:27,493
Huh? That's—

451
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:31,240
In other words,
we should assume there are others.

452
00:30:32,065 --> 00:30:34,776
And that thing is too much
for you to handle.

453
00:30:34,943 --> 00:30:35,944
Hold on a minute!

454
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:38,613
Are you saying
we're a burden?!

455
00:30:38,655 --> 00:30:40,615
To put it bluntly, yes.

456
00:30:42,033 --> 00:30:43,785
And I won't let you say that
you aren't already aware of that.

457
00:30:46,703 --> 00:30:48,621
Then, are we going to retreat?

458
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:52,085
No, I'm going in there alone.

459
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,211
Huh?!

460
00:30:53,378 --> 00:30:55,630
Without a doubt,
we can't leave this place alone.

461
00:30:56,339 --> 00:30:59,384
If anyone is going to deal with it,
it has to be a jonin like myself.

462
00:31:00,301 --> 00:31:03,054
You three go back to the village
and report the situation

463
00:31:03,721 --> 00:31:06,474
in case I don't return.

464
00:31:07,016 --> 00:31:08,226
Konohamaru-sensei!

465
00:31:09,139 --> 00:31:10,766
We can't do that,
Big Bro Konohamaru!

466
00:31:11,354 --> 00:31:12,355
I-It'll be fine.

467
00:31:12,397 --> 00:31:15,441
We can all work together
to beat a thing like that...!

468
00:31:17,527 --> 00:31:19,404
You guys don't know about
the Great Ninja War...

469
00:31:21,614 --> 00:31:25,159
or how terrifying the things
connected to Kaguya Otsutsuki are.

470
00:31:27,245 --> 00:31:32,083
The Otsutsuki are a god-like beings
who gave rise to ninja like us.

471
00:31:32,792 --> 00:31:35,753
Her power is beyond measure.

472
00:31:37,005 --> 00:31:38,256
She's that powerful?

473
00:31:38,673 --> 00:31:40,675
Without a doubt,
you three have grown strong.

474
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:42,552
But this is on another level.

475
00:31:43,143 --> 00:31:45,229
More strength is required
from here on out.

476
00:31:46,556 --> 00:31:47,557
Don't let this get you down...

477
00:31:47,765 --> 00:31:50,143
Take your time and
build up your strength.

478
00:31:51,352 --> 00:31:53,396
The one thing
we must absolutely avoid,

479
00:31:53,855 --> 00:31:55,523
is for all of us to die here.

480
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:57,859
So, you need to go back.

481
00:31:58,401 --> 00:31:59,444
That's an order.

482
00:32:11,331 --> 00:32:13,541
Please wait, Konohamaru-sensei!

483
00:32:18,296 --> 00:32:19,422
Sarada?

484
00:32:20,548 --> 00:32:22,967
It's not that I approve of Boruto...

485
00:32:23,635 --> 00:32:27,430
But I also think
we should go in together.

486
00:32:28,222 --> 00:32:29,265
You—!

487
00:32:29,307 --> 00:32:30,683
And why is that?

488
00:32:31,017 --> 00:32:34,020
We don't even know
where the enemy is hiding,

489
00:32:34,103 --> 00:32:36,731
so splitting up at this point
is too dangerous.

490
00:32:37,231 --> 00:32:39,776
It's possible it will target us too.

491
00:32:40,693 --> 00:32:43,029
In fact, I think the chance
of that is stronger.

492
00:32:43,404 --> 00:32:47,325
Even that thing knows enough
to come after the weaker ones.

493
00:32:48,701 --> 00:32:50,703
And if that's the case,
the best strategy is

494
00:32:50,745 --> 00:32:53,790
for us to come along and
provide you with back-up.

495
00:32:53,831 --> 00:32:55,833
Don't you think so, Sensei?

496
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:00,009
However...

497
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:01,773
Big Bro!

498
00:33:01,856 --> 00:33:03,733
If the risk is the same,

499
00:33:03,758 --> 00:33:06,928
I don't think we should split up
our fighting strength either.

500
00:33:09,095 --> 00:33:11,264
Damn it, I guess I have no choice.

501
00:33:13,518 --> 00:33:15,353
We'll prove it to you and
make ourselves useful, Big Bro...

502
00:33:15,436 --> 00:33:17,271
I mean, Konohamaru-sensei!

503
00:33:18,022 --> 00:33:18,902
I got it!

504
00:33:19,752 --> 00:33:23,422
But you absolutely must not
overestimate your strength.

505
00:33:24,404 --> 00:33:25,780
Change of orders.

506
00:33:25,905 --> 00:33:27,978
We will proceed together inside...

507
00:33:28,783 --> 00:33:30,326
and we'll take down this White Zetsu.

508
00:33:30,827 --> 00:33:32,996
And we're going to get through
this alive and go home, together!

509
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:34,163
– Right!
– Yeah!

510
00:33:34,455 --> 00:33:39,585
That's why I want you to listen carefully
to the strategy I'm about to explain.

511
00:33:40,003 --> 00:33:41,004
Strategy?

512
00:33:41,087 --> 00:33:44,549
Yeah, it's a no-fail strategy
to bring him down.

513
00:34:02,859 --> 00:34:03,985
Did we get him?!

514
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:08,823
No, it's coming!

515
00:34:09,233 --> 00:34:10,943
We'll proceed just as I explained!

516
00:34:11,242 --> 00:34:12,910
Sarada, Sharingan!

517
00:34:12,994 --> 00:34:13,828
Right!

518
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,530
It's going to come at us with Lightning Style,
Wind Style, then Fire Style!

519
00:34:30,803 --> 00:34:32,138
Leave the Lightning Style to me.

520
00:34:32,388 --> 00:34:33,384
<i>Snake Lightning!</i>

521
00:34:38,561 --> 00:34:39,395
All right!

522
00:34:39,604 --> 00:34:41,294
<i>Wind Style: Gale Palm!</i>

523
00:34:45,443 --> 00:34:47,195
<i>Fire Style: Fire Dragon Bomb!</i>

524
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,754
He knows he's getting nowhere
with jutsu-based attacks,

525
00:35:04,796 --> 00:35:06,130
so he's switching to
hand-to-hand combat...

526
00:35:08,508 --> 00:35:10,259
As predicted!

527
00:35:19,185 --> 00:35:20,520
Now, Boruto!

528
00:35:20,753 --> 00:35:22,088
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

529
00:35:30,207 --> 00:35:31,834
Hey, over here!

530
00:35:32,907 --> 00:35:37,453
No matter how atypical this monster is,
if we keep chipping away at him...

531
00:35:37,478 --> 00:35:40,272
As expected,
Konohamaru-sensei's strategy is brilliant.

532
00:35:40,414 --> 00:35:41,374
At this rate...

533
00:35:42,834 --> 00:35:45,837
That's the way.
Keep baiting it, Boruto!

534
00:35:46,273 --> 00:35:49,527
While you're doing that,
I'll get him with this!

535
00:36:00,977 --> 00:36:02,103
<i>Listen up.</i>

536
00:36:02,145 --> 00:36:05,106
<i>You're going to lure him
with your Shadow Clones.</i>

537
00:36:05,314 --> 00:36:08,109
<i>Don't do anything reckless, got it?</i>

538
00:36:09,527 --> 00:36:10,486
<i>But...</i>

539
00:36:20,413 --> 00:36:21,497
<i>It's weakened.</i>

540
00:36:21,956 --> 00:36:23,124
<i>If I do it now—!</i>

541
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:27,003
<i>Well, people will understand in time...</i>

542
00:36:27,044 --> 00:36:29,505
<i>and see your true power,
Young Lord.</i>

543
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,966
<i>And when that time comes...</i>

544
00:36:35,303 --> 00:36:36,846
Now's my chance!

545
00:36:36,929 --> 00:36:38,347
I'll settle this right now!

546
00:36:45,313 --> 00:36:46,105
Huh...

547
00:36:57,241 --> 00:36:58,084
Boruto!

548
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:07,376
It's no good. It's not working.

549
00:37:08,002 --> 00:37:09,337
Try to get away, Boruto!

550
00:37:11,672 --> 00:37:13,007
M-My chakra is—!

551
00:37:18,304 --> 00:37:19,180
Damn it!

552
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:20,598
At this rate...

553
00:37:20,623 --> 00:37:22,000
I won't let you have Boruto!

554
00:37:32,109 --> 00:37:33,511
All right, now!

555
00:37:46,082 --> 00:37:47,959
I saved the best for last!

556
00:37:48,042 --> 00:37:49,210
<i>Rasengan!</i>

557
00:37:55,841 --> 00:37:57,510
From the Third, known as The Professor...

558
00:37:57,927 --> 00:38:00,805
and the power I inherited from
Big Brother Naruto!

559
00:38:00,846 --> 00:38:02,432
Get a good taste of this!

560
00:38:08,229 --> 00:38:10,314
A-Amazing!

561
00:38:11,691 --> 00:38:12,608
He did it!

562
00:38:19,515 --> 00:38:20,474
Let's proceed inside!

563
00:38:23,552 --> 00:38:24,845
I know!

564
00:38:37,091 --> 00:38:37,883
What are those?!

565
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,597
I knew it.

566
00:38:44,098 --> 00:38:47,393
These are like the cocoons
that nurture White Zetsu.

567
00:38:48,195 --> 00:38:50,030
Don't tell me all of these...

568
00:38:50,804 --> 00:38:52,389
are like that monster?!

569
00:38:52,732 --> 00:38:54,984
No, that doesn't seem
to be the case.

570
00:39:01,424 --> 00:39:02,967
Yes, they're decomposed.

571
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:13,502
It seems we've come to
the innermost location.

572
00:39:13,836 --> 00:39:17,631
What if there are more
White Zetsu lurking in there?

573
00:39:18,363 --> 00:39:20,598
If so, we'll just have
to fight them off as hard

574
00:39:20,622 --> 00:39:22,433
as we can, using the
same strategy as earlier.

575
00:39:23,756 --> 00:39:24,966
Don't let your guard down.

576
00:39:43,406 --> 00:39:44,325
These are—!

577
00:39:45,368 --> 00:39:46,827
Don't touch that flame.

578
00:39:47,328 --> 00:39:48,913
What's going on with this one?

579
00:39:48,996 --> 00:39:50,331
Who knows?

580
00:39:52,434 --> 00:39:55,503
What's with these black flames?

581
00:39:57,171 --> 00:39:58,714
Everything's burning.

582
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,883
This is Amaterasu!

583
00:40:02,468 --> 00:40:03,677
What's that?

584
00:40:04,396 --> 00:40:05,522
It's Sasuke!

585
00:40:06,138 --> 00:40:08,432
Flames that only he can control,

586
00:40:08,516 --> 00:40:10,434
that can burn anything completely!

587
00:40:11,435 --> 00:40:12,520
I knew it...

588
00:40:15,272 --> 00:40:18,943
Looks like there were
several dozen of them in here.

589
00:40:19,554 --> 00:40:23,266
If Sasuke hadn't been here first,
we'd have been goners.

590
00:40:23,906 --> 00:40:25,825
Are you saying he destroyed
all of them by himself?

591
00:40:26,158 --> 00:40:27,034
Yeah.

592
00:40:27,243 --> 00:40:32,289
The Zetsu we encountered must've
managed to escape and survive.

593
00:40:33,086 --> 00:40:36,715
What's Sarada's dad doing here?

594
00:40:39,713 --> 00:40:41,966
I guess I have no choice,
since you've seen this much...

595
00:40:42,552 --> 00:40:45,820
Sasuke's been on a top-secret mission
all by himself,

596
00:40:45,845 --> 00:40:48,556
tracking the movements of
any remnants of Kaguya Otsutsuki.

597
00:40:48,722 --> 00:40:50,099
A top-secret mission?

598
00:40:50,399 --> 00:40:53,610
He said it's an important duty
that only he can fulfill.

599
00:40:53,769 --> 00:40:56,230
So where is your dad, Sarada?

600
00:40:56,772 --> 00:41:01,235
He can travel through time and space
with the power of his Rinnegan.

601
00:41:01,902 --> 00:41:03,654
He's probably far away by now.

602
00:41:05,364 --> 00:41:07,032
A-Awesome!

603
00:41:08,242 --> 00:41:09,785
You bet he's awesome.

604
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:14,963
Sasuke is the one and only rival
that Lord Seventh considers his equal.

605
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:17,934
Dad's—?!

606
00:41:18,377 --> 00:41:20,921
I heard that from my parent too...

607
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:24,771
That he gets no accolades,
but he is the supreme ninja

608
00:41:24,796 --> 00:41:27,924
who watches over the Hidden Leaf Village
from the shadows.

609
00:41:29,196 --> 00:41:31,115
<i>The supreme ninja?</i>

610
00:41:44,273 --> 00:41:48,318
I guess Sasuke ended up
saving you, Konohamaru.

611
00:41:48,532 --> 00:41:51,202
Yes, but Lord Seventh...

612
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:54,062
I know you're a clone, but why did you
come all the way out here?

613
00:41:54,246 --> 00:41:57,833
I can't ignore anything
that involves Kaguya.

614
00:41:58,584 --> 00:42:02,004
Still, I can't believe
you found a ruin here too.

615
00:42:02,713 --> 00:42:05,132
Which means there are others?

616
00:42:05,508 --> 00:42:06,425
Yeah.

617
00:42:06,596 --> 00:42:08,390
But judging by that one's appearance...

618
00:42:08,662 --> 00:42:10,059
For her to get these guys ready,

619
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:12,986
Kaguya must've been expecting
an intense battle

620
00:42:13,224 --> 00:42:14,975
with some formidable enemies...

621
00:42:16,786 --> 00:42:20,420
An enemy that can only be confronted by
creating an army of monsters like these?

622
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,790
I wonder who they could be?

623
00:42:23,789 --> 00:42:24,860
Who knows?

624
00:42:25,319 --> 00:42:28,155
In any case, seems we're going to
have our hands full again...

625
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:36,530
So, we're being left in the dark,
after all?

626
00:42:36,997 --> 00:42:38,541
It can't be helped.

627
00:42:38,566 --> 00:42:41,027
That's what it's supposed
to be like for genin.

628
00:42:41,418 --> 00:42:42,962
Well, I don't like it!

629
00:42:43,087 --> 00:42:44,089
Even though we...

630
00:42:44,114 --> 00:42:46,032
"Fought too" was that what
you were going to say?

631
00:42:46,632 --> 00:42:50,427
But when it counted most,
we didn't have enough strength.

632
00:42:50,588 --> 00:42:52,246
Neither of us.

633
00:42:55,283 --> 00:42:59,662
Konohamaru-sensei said we're not to
say a word about this to anyone.

634
00:43:00,481 --> 00:43:04,358
It means Lord Seventh and
the higher-ups will deal with the rest.

635
00:43:07,945 --> 00:43:13,158
<i>Sasuke is the one and only rival
that Lord Seventh considers his equal.</i>

636
00:43:14,827 --> 00:43:17,033
<i>Power that the grown-ups...
and everyone...</i>

637
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:20,237
<i>and Dad will acknowledge...</i>

638
00:43:27,923 --> 00:43:29,675
<i>I still don't have enough.</i>

639
00:43:30,593 --> 00:43:33,846
<i>What are some of your thoughts
when you look back on</i>

640
00:43:34,013 --> 00:43:35,472
<i>the Fourth Great Ninja War?</i>

641
00:43:36,098 --> 00:43:37,963
<i>Yeah... there were a lot of casualties</i>

642
00:43:37,988 --> 00:43:40,019
– It's Lord Hokage!
– <i>in that battle.</i>

643
00:43:40,561 --> 00:43:42,575
<i>I think there are a lot of ninja now
who don't know about that.</i>

644
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,476
Dad?

645
00:43:43,647 --> 00:43:47,067
<i>The most important thing is
to communicate properly</i>

646
00:43:47,151 --> 00:43:49,403
<i>everything that's happened
up to now, you know?</i>

647
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:50,821
<i>You're right.</i>

648
00:43:50,904 --> 00:43:52,656
<i>As Naruto, Lord Seventh,
just said...</i>

649
00:43:52,698 --> 00:43:55,868
<i>peace was reached after
the many wars of the past.</i>

650
00:43:55,951 --> 00:43:58,746
<i>But we must never forget that
this peace was made possible</i>

651
00:43:58,771 --> 00:44:02,108
<i>through the sacrifice of
many, many shinobi.</i>

652
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:05,794
<i>We must make sure we teach
this history to the youth,</i>

653
00:44:06,004 --> 00:44:08,605
<i>to the next generation,
in order to preserve peace...</i>

654
00:44:08,838 --> 00:44:11,091
<i>You could say it's our responsibility
to do so.</i>

655
00:44:12,092 --> 00:44:14,178
I get it already.

656
00:44:14,219 --> 00:44:16,930
I've heard this so much,
it's a drag.

657
00:44:16,955 --> 00:44:18,957
It's even in our text books.

658
00:44:19,391 --> 00:44:22,311
<i>Now, turning our attention
to the Chunin Exams,</i>

659
00:44:22,336 --> 00:44:27,116
<i>which for the first time, the five
villages have agreed to sponsor together...</i>

660
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:33,045
<i>Naruto, do you have any advice
for the genin who will be taking part?</i>

661
00:44:34,396 --> 00:44:37,399
<i>Remember these three things!</i>

662
00:44:37,868 --> 00:44:38,952
<i>Three things?</i>

663
00:44:38,994 --> 00:44:40,829
<i>Teamwork... and perseverance!</i>

664
00:44:40,829 --> 00:44:45,125
<i>And... well...
Good luck to everyone!</i>

665
00:44:46,919 --> 00:44:48,545
<i>That was just two things...</i>

666
00:44:49,155 --> 00:44:51,699
<i>Anyway, thank you for
your inspiring comments.</i>

667
00:44:54,009 --> 00:44:57,846
<i>Thanks for joining us live today.</i>

668
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:00,849
<i>Thank you very much, Naruto.</i>

669
00:45:01,141 --> 00:45:01,816
<i>Sure!</i>

670
00:45:04,061 --> 00:45:07,064
<i>It seems Lord Hokage is
as busy as ever.</i>

671
00:45:08,107 --> 00:45:10,567
He had his Shadow Clone
do the interview on TV.

672
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:13,462
Lord Hokage is so amazing!

673
00:45:18,127 --> 00:45:19,211
<i>At this rate...</i>

674
00:45:20,367 --> 00:45:21,743
<i>I won't be able to change a thing.</i>

675
00:45:24,498 --> 00:45:27,918
I never thought I'd become a ninja...

676
00:45:27,948 --> 00:45:30,368
And here I am, a chunin.

677
00:45:30,493 --> 00:45:31,953
Don't get ahead of yourself.

678
00:45:32,548 --> 00:45:34,341
You can celebrate
when you pass.

679
00:45:35,616 --> 00:45:38,035
Oh yeah,
we still have the exams.

680
00:45:38,887 --> 00:45:39,888
Hey Boruto...

681
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:43,280
Don't do anything stupid until
we get our recommendation letters.

682
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:45,477
Pranks are off-limits for a while, huh?

683
00:45:46,228 --> 00:45:47,396
About that...

684
00:45:47,896 --> 00:45:49,982
I really couldn't care less about it.

685
00:45:50,315 --> 00:45:51,024
– Huh?
– Huh?

686
00:45:51,628 --> 00:45:55,173
Chunin, jonin...
That's sorta like a license, right?

687
00:45:55,738 --> 00:45:57,551
Why should we get so
hung up on rules

688
00:45:57,576 --> 00:45:59,658
that people from a long time ago
came up with?

689
00:45:59,918 --> 00:46:02,921
Instead, we should just go for it
and become even greater ninja.

690
00:46:03,495 --> 00:46:05,581
What do you mean
by "even greater"?

691
00:46:06,553 --> 00:46:07,804
Well...

692
00:46:08,371 --> 00:46:10,706
Like Sasuke.

693
00:46:11,551 --> 00:46:12,343
Huh?

694
00:46:13,009 --> 00:46:14,886
You mean Sarada's dad?

695
00:46:15,424 --> 00:46:17,217
He doesn't take orders
from anyone,

696
00:46:17,242 --> 00:46:19,828
but he battles powerful enemies
on his own terms.

697
00:46:20,291 --> 00:46:22,042
ninja like that exist.

698
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:25,225
Rumors say he's mysterious too!

699
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:26,960
That's what's cool about him.

700
00:46:27,462 --> 00:46:30,923
It's way cooler than going on TV
and rambling on and on.

701
00:46:35,778 --> 00:46:39,406
Why are you making things
complicated at this point?

702
00:46:39,698 --> 00:46:41,158
I'm not.

703
00:46:41,492 --> 00:46:42,993
I got into the Academy and

704
00:46:43,035 --> 00:46:45,412
decided to become a ninja
with all you guys.

705
00:46:45,929 --> 00:46:47,639
That's for real.

706
00:46:49,522 --> 00:46:54,902
And that's why, I'm thinking about
how I can be even cooler.

707
00:46:55,297 --> 00:46:57,382
I'm just doing things
my own way.

708
00:46:58,717 --> 00:46:59,885
You know...

709
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:03,597
Only guys who want to stand out
say things like that.

710
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:04,932
That's not it.

711
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:06,767
Then what is it?

712
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:09,603
Like I said,
I'll do things my way.

713
00:47:10,354 --> 00:47:11,355
Later!

714
00:47:12,356 --> 00:47:13,524
Damn it.

715
00:47:13,899 --> 00:47:16,401
He's such a drag.

716
00:47:18,362 --> 00:47:22,825
I've brought the applications
for this year's Chunin Exams.

717
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:27,186
That means we'll get
official recommendations, right?

718
00:47:27,448 --> 00:47:28,532
Well, yeah.

719
00:47:28,916 --> 00:47:33,171
Your work has been recognized,
so I can breathe easy.

720
00:47:33,643 --> 00:47:36,438
Well, there were quite
a few instances of chaos...

721
00:47:36,588 --> 00:47:39,683
Damn it. They sure work us genin
to the bone.

722
00:47:39,708 --> 00:47:40,792
The hell?!

723
00:47:41,093 --> 00:47:43,720
If you don't want it, I can always
take the recommendation back!

724
00:47:43,804 --> 00:47:46,390
No! I never said we weren't going
to take the Exams!

725
00:47:46,723 --> 00:47:48,225
Right, Cho-Cho?

726
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:49,182
Huh?

727
00:47:49,292 --> 00:47:51,919
Did you say something about being patient
with your triglycerides?

728
00:47:51,995 --> 00:47:53,914
I'm talking about
the Chunin Exams.

729
00:47:54,439 --> 00:47:56,567
Maybe you've got fat stuffed
in your ears?

730
00:47:56,592 --> 00:48:00,137
Mm... Like a sausage pizza, nice.

731
00:48:00,529 --> 00:48:02,197
You're not listening!

732
00:48:04,199 --> 00:48:05,095
Sorry...

733
00:48:05,302 --> 00:48:08,371
You've been sending your clones
out nonstop due to the Zetsu incident.

734
00:48:09,913 --> 00:48:11,498
I'm okay.

735
00:48:11,843 --> 00:48:15,013
The Chunin Exams are coming up.
I have to manage somehow.

736
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:20,799
Oh, Katasuke.

737
00:48:21,216 --> 00:48:22,050
What's up?

738
00:48:22,175 --> 00:48:25,304
Well, as the head of
the Scientific Ninja Tools department,

739
00:48:25,387 --> 00:48:28,056
I have a request to make,
Lord Seventh.

740
00:48:28,226 --> 00:48:29,060
What is it?

741
00:48:29,641 --> 00:48:31,518
For the upcoming Chunin Exams,

742
00:48:31,518 --> 00:48:33,770
we would like your authorization
to use

743
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:35,355
the Scientific Ninja Tools
developed by our team!

744
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:37,915
That's right!

745
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:41,719
I read the report that they've made
considerable progress recently.

746
00:48:42,362 --> 00:48:45,407
Yes, they are battle-ready now!

747
00:48:48,952 --> 00:48:50,621
That's a Wind Style jutsu.

748
00:48:50,954 --> 00:48:52,539
That's actually pretty interesting.

749
00:48:54,666 --> 00:48:55,542
Isn't it?

750
00:48:55,834 --> 00:48:59,546
You just change the cartridge,
and you can use a jutsu at will.

751
00:48:59,796 --> 00:49:01,131
I see.

752
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,635
Then the genin won't have
to go through harsh training

753
00:49:04,718 --> 00:49:07,304
and they can widen the scope
of their individual ninjutsu!

754
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:09,014
What do you think?

755
00:49:09,097 --> 00:49:12,309
Their performance will also
be more elaborate.

756
00:49:13,644 --> 00:49:15,103
Thanks, Katasuke.

757
00:49:15,812 --> 00:49:17,105
But I can't approve it.

758
00:49:17,397 --> 00:49:18,106
Huh?

759
00:49:18,156 --> 00:49:20,825
The Chunin Exam is not
a performance.

760
00:49:21,234 --> 00:49:23,278
Its purpose is to nurture shinobi.

761
00:49:23,445 --> 00:49:25,113
All the more reason then!

762
00:49:25,322 --> 00:49:29,493
The Scientific Ninja Tool was invented
for the modern shinobi.

763
00:49:29,576 --> 00:49:32,371
Taking the easy way out on
a test to measure their skills

764
00:49:32,412 --> 00:49:34,164
will only end up
shortchanging them.

765
00:49:34,206 --> 00:49:35,122
That's true...

766
00:49:35,147 --> 00:49:36,107
I understand.

767
00:49:36,132 --> 00:49:39,381
But there's a school of thought that
the masterful use of copied jutsu

768
00:49:39,461 --> 00:49:43,048
like the Sixth Hokage, is also
the mark of an outstanding ninja.

769
00:49:43,382 --> 00:49:46,009
Sure, if that power came
from within himself.

770
00:49:46,468 --> 00:49:49,513
However, the purpose of
the Chunin Exams is to measure

771
00:49:49,538 --> 00:49:53,459
a genin's strength that
they have cultivated to this day.

772
00:49:55,116 --> 00:49:56,520
I see...

773
00:49:56,979 --> 00:49:58,271
Excuse me.

774
00:50:02,901 --> 00:50:05,112
Do you think I was rude to him?

775
00:50:05,529 --> 00:50:06,905
Don't worry about it.

776
00:50:07,239 --> 00:50:09,408
You were absolutely right.

777
00:50:11,034 --> 00:50:11,910
Okay...

778
00:50:13,912 --> 00:50:14,830
Yes!

779
00:50:15,163 --> 00:50:17,537
I stopped the boss attack
with an instant kill!

780
00:50:17,562 --> 00:50:18,605
What?

781
00:50:19,001 --> 00:50:21,586
Your character is
super strong today.

782
00:50:24,548 --> 00:50:25,841
I'm ready.

783
00:50:26,345 --> 00:50:27,679
Just waiting for you, Boruto.

784
00:50:27,999 --> 00:50:29,834
S-Sorry...

785
00:50:33,181 --> 00:50:35,267
Hey, what's up with this level?

786
00:50:36,768 --> 00:50:38,729
You used something,
didn't you, Boruto?

787
00:50:39,062 --> 00:50:40,397
Yeah, so?

788
00:50:40,856 --> 00:50:43,692
If I use this, it makes it easy
to beat the boss.

789
00:50:44,693 --> 00:50:46,361
I'll send you the data too.

790
00:50:49,072 --> 00:50:51,575
Yeah... this is a cheat.

791
00:50:52,279 --> 00:50:53,650
Although your level is impressive.

792
00:50:54,202 --> 00:50:58,165
Yeah but... This is only fun because
I have to sneak away

793
00:50:58,190 --> 00:51:00,651
from my mom to level up.

794
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:04,577
That's so boring!
Isn't that a drag?

795
00:51:05,161 --> 00:51:07,664
What's the point if you can't win?

796
00:51:11,383 --> 00:51:13,677
So, you're an expert at
video games too?

797
00:51:14,282 --> 00:51:15,867
I brought the applications.

798
00:51:17,542 --> 00:51:19,378
Look, Mitsuki.

799
00:51:19,461 --> 00:51:21,546
I already told you
I'm not going to enter.

800
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:23,139
Oh, is that right?

801
00:51:23,198 --> 00:51:23,949
I see.

802
00:51:24,098 --> 00:51:26,976
Damn it. Are you still
saying stuff like that?

803
00:51:27,944 --> 00:51:31,198
If that's how you feel,
it doesn't really matter to me anyway...

804
00:51:31,907 --> 00:51:33,116
But are you sure
you're all right with that?

805
00:51:34,821 --> 00:51:36,406
Of course it's not okay!

806
00:51:37,204 --> 00:51:40,290
I was worried, so I came here,
and what do I hear you say?!

807
00:51:40,499 --> 00:51:42,876
I can't rely on Mitsuki!

808
00:51:43,168 --> 00:51:44,920
Listen, Boruto!

809
00:51:45,337 --> 00:51:48,048
My dream is to become Hokage!

810
00:51:48,965 --> 00:51:50,217
I know that!

811
00:51:50,675 --> 00:51:54,429
I can't waste time being
a genin.

812
00:51:54,856 --> 00:51:56,774
I'm going to pass the Exams
as soon as possible.

813
00:51:57,205 --> 00:51:59,082
Like it'll be that easy.

814
00:51:59,208 --> 00:51:59,792
Right?

815
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:01,420
What is it?

816
00:52:01,571 --> 00:52:03,531
Are you going to get
in my way?

817
00:52:03,556 --> 00:52:05,225
I have no intention of doing that.

818
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:08,147
You can go ahead and
do whatever you want.

819
00:52:08,172 --> 00:52:09,048
Huh?!

820
00:52:09,073 --> 00:52:11,492
Were you even listening
to the teachers?

821
00:52:11,555 --> 00:52:15,308
A three-man team is required
to take the Exams.

822
00:52:15,592 --> 00:52:17,343
You can find someone else.

823
00:52:17,734 --> 00:52:18,860
It's too late at this point!

824
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:21,304
There's no way
I can find someone that easily!

825
00:52:21,329 --> 00:52:22,664
She's right.

826
00:52:23,052 --> 00:52:26,597
Our teamwork didn't come
together overnight.

827
00:52:26,741 --> 00:52:27,617
That's true.

828
00:52:27,642 --> 00:52:29,477
I don't care.

829
00:52:29,502 --> 00:52:31,379
You've been acting
so weird lately, Boruto.

830
00:52:31,878 --> 00:52:33,256
Why are you being so stubborn?

831
00:52:33,281 --> 00:52:34,282
Whatever.

832
00:52:36,217 --> 00:52:37,385
Hey, Boruto.

833
00:52:37,597 --> 00:52:38,390
Huh?

834
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,393
You just want to hear
your father say you're great,

835
00:52:41,418 --> 00:52:42,836
more than anything... right?

836
00:52:42,918 --> 00:52:44,002
Oh...

837
00:52:44,229 --> 00:52:46,481
What would you know about me?

838
00:52:46,707 --> 00:52:47,791
I know...

839
00:52:47,849 --> 00:52:49,559
Because you're my sun.

840
00:52:50,808 --> 00:52:53,394
So that's it...

841
00:52:53,901 --> 00:52:55,425
You're acting like a child.

842
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:56,535
I heard that.

843
00:52:57,413 --> 00:52:58,392
Listen, Boruto.

844
00:52:58,908 --> 00:53:00,910
The way you're acting
is pretty uncool.

845
00:53:02,556 --> 00:53:04,641
Is this the real Boruto Uzumaki?

846
00:53:08,087 --> 00:53:09,255
Come on, Boruto!

847
00:53:09,896 --> 00:53:14,752
Let's show Lord Hokage just how
awesome we are in the upcoming Exams!

848
00:53:15,329 --> 00:53:16,143
Huh?

849
00:53:16,217 --> 00:53:17,886
It's our chance.

850
00:53:18,221 --> 00:53:23,223
You'll be able to show your dad and all of
the spectators just how amazing you are.

851
00:53:23,415 --> 00:53:25,166
And I can pass the exam too!

852
00:53:25,274 --> 00:53:26,275
Me too.

853
00:53:31,622 --> 00:53:33,791
I guess I have no choice!

854
00:53:36,948 --> 00:53:38,825
Okay already... I get it.

855
00:53:39,442 --> 00:53:41,778
Seriously, I guess you guys just can't
do anything without me.

856
00:53:41,988 --> 00:53:44,365
Three-man team or whatever...
just leave it to me.

857
00:53:45,444 --> 00:53:46,405
He's so easy!

858
00:53:46,475 --> 00:53:48,185
You really know how
to manipulate Boruto, Sarada.

859
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:49,544
I can hear you!

860
00:53:50,378 --> 00:53:52,339
A man doesn't go back
on his word, right?

861
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,506
Well, yeah...

862
00:53:54,203 --> 00:53:56,205
I couldn't care less about
being a chunin.

863
00:53:56,335 --> 00:53:59,672
But I'll just ace the exam
and wow everyone...

864
00:54:00,347 --> 00:54:02,650
and make them see Boruto Uzumaki
is finally here!

865
00:54:02,675 --> 00:54:04,157
Big Brother!

866
00:54:04,476 --> 00:54:05,977
Oh, Hima!

867
00:54:06,519 --> 00:54:07,979
Hey, Himawari!

868
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:12,317
But before that, there's something
important I have to do...

869
00:54:12,734 --> 00:54:13,610
– Huh?
– Huh?

870
00:54:14,110 --> 00:54:16,112
It's a man-to-man promise.

871
00:54:17,822 --> 00:54:18,907
We're back!

872
00:54:19,033 --> 00:54:21,035
Big Brother is home!

873
00:54:22,911 --> 00:54:24,913
Oh, welcome home.

874
00:54:29,622 --> 00:54:30,373
Daddy!

875
00:54:32,212 --> 00:54:33,380
We're back, we're back...

876
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:34,464
– <i>So, you remembered.</i>
– we're back!

877
00:54:34,506 --> 00:54:36,549
Welcome home, welcome home,
welcome home!

878
00:54:37,842 --> 00:54:38,969
He remembered.

879
00:55:03,184 --> 00:55:06,103
So, you remembered our promise.

880
00:55:06,955 --> 00:55:08,873
Well, yeah...

881
00:55:09,836 --> 00:55:11,630
Then we're even.

882
00:55:12,919 --> 00:55:16,089
I can put up with it.
I'm a man.

883
00:55:19,134 --> 00:55:24,014
But if you had made Himawari cry,
I was going to let you have it.

884
00:55:24,764 --> 00:55:26,266
So we're even now.

885
00:55:27,309 --> 00:55:29,477
I'll forgive you for today!

886
00:55:31,062 --> 00:55:32,147
Thank you.

887
00:55:32,981 --> 00:55:34,316
As long as you get it.

888
00:55:46,594 --> 00:55:47,685
Daddy!

889
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:50,213
Dad, everything's ready!

890
00:55:51,814 --> 00:55:52,617
Okay!

891
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:55,503
All right!

892
00:55:55,545 --> 00:55:56,880
Everything's ready!

893
00:55:56,905 --> 00:55:57,698
Yes!

894
00:55:57,878 --> 00:56:00,547
Here comes the cake!

895
00:56:00,643 --> 00:56:01,227
Whoa!

896
00:56:01,252 --> 00:56:02,212
It's so big!

897
00:56:02,844 --> 00:56:06,014
Himawari's birthday party
is about to start!

898
00:56:29,829 --> 00:56:32,665
Big Brother, I...

899
00:56:34,709 --> 00:56:36,086
That damned...

900
00:56:36,419 --> 00:56:39,464
It's Himawari's birthday!
What the hell does he think this is?!

901
00:56:39,881 --> 00:56:41,007
Boruto!

902
00:56:41,044 --> 00:56:41,711
Boruto!

903
00:56:41,736 --> 00:56:42,904
Let me go, Mom!

904
00:56:43,176 --> 00:56:46,721
I'm going to beat that loser up!

905
00:56:46,746 --> 00:56:47,705
Boruto!

906
00:56:47,733 --> 00:56:50,569
Your father has to work very hard
for the people of the village.

907
00:56:50,594 --> 00:56:53,389
And what about us?!
Aren't we part of the village too?!

908
00:56:54,479 --> 00:56:57,607
So when you're the Hokage,
it's okay to ignore your own family?!

909
00:56:57,632 --> 00:57:01,553
It doesn't mean he's forgotten
about the two of you.

910
00:57:01,578 --> 00:57:04,873
I've heard that so many times
already, ya know!

911
00:57:05,238 --> 00:57:07,586
I'm sick and tired of that excuse!

912
00:57:08,522 --> 00:57:09,357
Boruto...

913
00:57:10,745 --> 00:57:12,330
When Dad was a kid,

914
00:57:12,355 --> 00:57:15,191
Grandpa Hokage wasn't even alive!

915
00:57:16,209 --> 00:57:18,670
Which means
he grew up not knowing

916
00:57:18,711 --> 00:57:20,547
how fun it's supposed to be
with your family, right?

917
00:57:21,172 --> 00:57:22,430
No wonder he doesn't care!

918
00:57:22,455 --> 00:57:23,372
Boruto!

919
00:57:28,888 --> 00:57:31,307
Why did my dad have to
be the Hokage?!

920
00:57:33,072 --> 00:57:35,700
He just sits at his desk
all day and acts bossy!

921
00:57:37,185 --> 00:57:39,562
Anyone can do that!

922
00:57:40,608 --> 00:57:45,905
I understand it's hard not having
your father around on important days.

923
00:57:48,283 --> 00:57:53,955
But it's different with you.
You have a father who's actually here.

924
00:57:55,659 --> 00:57:56,827
Boruto...

925
00:58:02,755 --> 00:58:03,673
Mommy...

926
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:06,259
I'm sorry, Himawari.

927
00:58:07,093 --> 00:58:08,219
I'm so sorry.

928
00:58:51,821 --> 00:58:53,264
It's so dirty...

929
00:58:53,848 --> 00:58:55,475
and torn up...

930
00:58:57,227 --> 00:58:59,771
<i>But it's different with you.</i>

931
00:59:00,546 --> 00:59:03,507
<i>You have a father
who's actually here.</i>

932
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:07,278
This is so uncool!

933
00:59:07,902 --> 00:59:09,280
So uncool...

934
00:59:10,073 --> 00:59:11,407
Dad is...

935
00:59:12,676 --> 00:59:13,802
and so am I.

936
00:59:15,912 --> 00:59:18,414
So you've decided to come home...
stupid old man?!

937
00:59:26,673 --> 00:59:30,260
I-I'm sorry,
I thought you were my dad...

938
00:59:31,386 --> 00:59:32,845
You're Naruto's son?

939
00:59:33,555 --> 00:59:34,514
What's your name?

940
00:59:35,557 --> 00:59:37,600
Boruto Uzumaki...

941
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:39,978
What's the matter, Boruto?

942
00:59:41,293 --> 00:59:42,882
Is that... really you...

943
00:59:42,907 --> 00:59:44,859
Sasuke?

944
00:59:46,093 --> 00:59:47,177
Is Naruto here?

945
00:59:48,602 --> 00:59:50,989
I think he's still at
the Hokage's office.

946
00:59:52,907 --> 00:59:53,741
I see...

947
00:59:54,492 --> 00:59:55,702
Sorry to bother you.

948
00:59:59,004 --> 01:00:03,258
<i>So he's
Sasuke... Uchiha...</i>

949
01:00:04,419 --> 01:00:05,211
H-Hey...

950
01:00:05,336 --> 01:00:06,796
Never mind that now...

951
01:00:07,255 --> 01:00:08,968
I have to go beat up
that stupid old man!

952
01:00:08,993 --> 01:00:10,346
Boruto, please wait!

953
01:00:12,302 --> 01:00:13,845
What the hell are you doing?!

954
01:00:14,762 --> 01:00:16,681
Your mother just said to wait.

955
01:00:16,848 --> 01:00:18,641
Mind your own business!

956
01:00:18,975 --> 01:00:20,643
You said "stupid old man,"
didn't you?

957
01:00:21,269 --> 01:00:22,604
Were you talking about Naruto?

958
01:00:23,688 --> 01:00:25,064
Yeah, I was.

959
01:00:28,776 --> 01:00:29,611
Boruto...

960
01:00:47,837 --> 01:00:49,339
I messed up again...

961
01:00:51,924 --> 01:00:54,761
<i>Dad... What am I supposed to do?</i>

962
01:00:57,430 --> 01:00:58,640
Hey, what happened?!

963
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:03,645
Well, I just messed up
Himawari's birthday too.

964
01:01:04,395 --> 01:01:06,606
You sent a Shadow Clone
to the house?

965
01:01:07,398 --> 01:01:08,232
Yeah...

966
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:10,276
You're hopeless!

967
01:01:10,985 --> 01:01:13,196
I told you to go home today.

968
01:01:13,653 --> 01:01:16,031
That just wasn't possible.

969
01:01:18,794 --> 01:01:21,505
The preparations for
the Chunin Exams are late...

970
01:01:21,815 --> 01:01:24,818
And there's the discovery
of White Zetsu's ruins.

971
01:01:26,095 --> 01:01:29,557
It's been ten years already
since the Great Ninja War...

972
01:01:29,712 --> 01:01:31,130
It's troubling.

973
01:01:31,433 --> 01:01:32,350
Yeah...

974
01:01:35,051 --> 01:01:36,761
A gift from Kaguya's Palace.

975
01:01:38,096 --> 01:01:39,055
Sasuke!

976
01:01:46,938 --> 01:01:47,980
I see.

977
01:01:49,023 --> 01:01:50,400
What does it say?

978
01:01:51,526 --> 01:01:52,360
I don't know.

979
01:01:54,455 --> 01:01:56,790
But... I'm getting a bad feeling
about this.

980
01:01:57,323 --> 01:01:59,117
I can't even read it with
my Rinnegan.

981
01:02:00,118 --> 01:02:02,662
Let's hand this over to
the Cipher Corps.

982
01:02:03,496 --> 01:02:06,332
Sasuke, you just said
Kaguya's Palace...

983
01:02:06,499 --> 01:02:08,876
Yeah... I finally found it.

984
01:02:11,045 --> 01:02:12,088
Otsutsuki?

985
01:02:12,755 --> 01:02:13,506
Yeah.

986
01:02:13,745 --> 01:02:14,871
That's what he called himself.

987
01:02:15,412 --> 01:02:16,455
There's no doubt that

988
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:20,192
he belongs to the same
Otsutsuki Clan as Kaguya.

989
01:02:20,722 --> 01:02:22,140
This is a crisis!

990
01:02:22,593 --> 01:02:24,303
Is this the start of another war?!

991
01:02:24,328 --> 01:02:26,288
We're not sure yet.

992
01:02:26,999 --> 01:02:29,293
But we have to be very careful.

993
01:02:32,483 --> 01:02:36,279
We must never cause
another war like that.

994
01:02:43,244 --> 01:02:44,454
My clothes?

995
01:02:45,204 --> 01:02:46,372
Why do you have that?

996
01:02:46,756 --> 01:02:48,216
I found it on the way here.

997
01:02:48,666 --> 01:02:49,542
Huh?

998
01:02:49,876 --> 01:02:51,544
Near your house.

999
01:02:54,505 --> 01:02:55,631
I see...

1000
01:02:56,257 --> 01:02:57,842
And I also met your kid.

1001
01:02:58,551 --> 01:03:00,511
Seems just like you
when you were young.

1002
01:03:01,345 --> 01:03:03,765
He's nothing like how I was.

1003
01:03:04,307 --> 01:03:07,018
He's a lot more like you
when you were young.

1004
01:03:10,313 --> 01:03:12,648
No... I take that back.

1005
01:03:12,774 --> 01:03:15,193
He's different from you too.

1006
01:03:15,985 --> 01:03:20,198
The clothes he wears always
look brand new.

1007
01:03:21,478 --> 01:03:24,982
I guess guys like us are
behind the times.

1008
01:03:27,915 --> 01:03:28,541
No...

1009
01:03:29,387 --> 01:03:30,472
You're wrong.

1010
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:34,670
The soul of a shinobi always
remains the same...

1011
01:03:35,487 --> 01:03:37,114
even if times change.

1012
01:03:38,841 --> 01:03:40,343
I wonder about that...

1013
01:03:40,676 --> 01:03:43,763
Anyway, I think I win
this argument.

1014
01:03:45,586 --> 01:03:46,837
You're one to talk, loser.

1015
01:04:00,279 --> 01:04:01,322
He disappeared!

1016
01:04:07,078 --> 01:04:08,412
You're amazing!

1017
01:04:08,746 --> 01:04:11,040
You used to be my dad's rival, right?

1018
01:04:13,584 --> 01:04:16,254
I get it now... brand new, huh?

1019
01:04:17,922 --> 01:04:19,715
Please make me your student!

1020
01:04:19,882 --> 01:04:22,009
There's someone I want
to bring down, no matter what it takes!

1021
01:04:25,137 --> 01:04:26,722
Can you do the Rasengan?

1022
01:04:30,017 --> 01:04:32,478
If you can't, you can't be
a student of mine.

1023
01:04:34,355 --> 01:04:35,731
That's a piece of cake!

1024
01:04:38,943 --> 01:04:40,149
<i>Naruto...</i>

1025
01:04:40,174 --> 01:04:42,885
<i>That earlier contest
isn't over and decided yet.</i>

1026
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:46,242
Konohamaru-sensei!

1027
01:04:46,959 --> 01:04:48,985
Konohamaru-sensei!

1028
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:52,597
What's all this, eh?

1029
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:55,774
Please teach me your Rasengan!

1030
01:04:56,002 --> 01:04:59,547
I have to master it right now!

1031
01:05:01,048 --> 01:05:06,127
So you want to learn it for the Chunin
Exams and surprise the Seventh Hokage.

1032
01:05:06,178 --> 01:05:07,722
Is that it?

1033
01:05:07,989 --> 01:05:10,669
Now you're talking like a shinobi!

1034
01:05:11,017 --> 01:05:12,894
Well... yeah.

1035
01:05:14,478 --> 01:05:19,066
<i>Imagine me, the instructor who gets to
pass on this jutsu to the Hokage's son!</i>

1036
01:05:19,275 --> 01:05:21,736
<i>Oh, Lord Fourth, Lord Seventh...!</i>

1037
01:05:21,777 --> 01:05:25,323
<i>I swear I will fulfill this
very important duty!</i>

1038
01:05:31,984 --> 01:05:33,318
Hey, Boruto!

1039
01:05:33,343 --> 01:05:34,678
Get serious, will ya?

1040
01:05:34,874 --> 01:05:35,583
Huh?

1041
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:37,084
Was I sleeping?

1042
01:05:37,752 --> 01:05:41,172
I heard you were dozing off during
your mission today too.

1043
01:05:41,547 --> 01:05:46,177
When you get as good as I am,
you can complete missions half-asleep!

1044
01:05:46,761 --> 01:05:49,305
Thank goodness it was
an easy babysitting mission.

1045
01:05:49,555 --> 01:05:50,848
Ugh...

1046
01:05:51,223 --> 01:05:53,601
Have you been up to something
that's keeping you awake all night?

1047
01:05:53,976 --> 01:05:56,145
N-No, not really.

1048
01:05:58,898 --> 01:06:03,527
<i>He's being weirdly enthusiastic
all because of my dad...</i>

1049
01:06:06,028 --> 01:06:06,988
Coming!

1050
01:06:12,039 --> 01:06:13,331
What's the matter?

1051
01:06:15,933 --> 01:06:17,518
Sa... Sa...!

1052
01:06:19,251 --> 01:06:20,211
I'm home...

1053
01:06:22,338 --> 01:06:23,923
Oh, Sasuke!

1054
01:06:24,757 --> 01:06:29,136
You don't have to collapse just because
Dad comes home unexpectedly...

1055
01:06:30,054 --> 01:06:31,973
So how long can you
stay this time?

1056
01:06:33,775 --> 01:06:35,903
Until your Chunin Exams are over.

1057
01:06:38,231 --> 01:06:40,650
I just met Naruto's son earlier.

1058
01:06:41,315 --> 01:06:42,525
Boruto?

1059
01:06:42,692 --> 01:06:44,777
He said he wants to become
my student.

1060
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:49,532
<i>Well, the Exams require
three-man teams...</i>

1061
01:06:49,657 --> 01:06:52,368
<i>so it's better if he's at his best.</i>

1062
01:06:57,790 --> 01:06:59,417
What happened to
your enthusiasm from earlier?!

1063
01:06:59,834 --> 01:07:01,210
Come on, once more.

1064
01:07:01,335 --> 01:07:03,170
Watch closely and copy me, like so.

1065
01:07:03,212 --> 01:07:04,463
I know, I know!

1066
01:07:04,588 --> 01:07:07,341
But it's not working at all...
like so!

1067
01:07:07,366 --> 01:07:09,743
Don't copy the way I speak, like so!

1068
01:07:09,802 --> 01:07:13,389
No..."Like so" means this!

1069
01:07:13,389 --> 01:07:15,725
"Like so" means this in my hand...

1070
01:07:15,725 --> 01:07:17,268
Quit saying "like so", "like so"!

1071
01:07:17,309 --> 01:07:18,853
Which one is it?!

1072
01:07:21,063 --> 01:07:23,107
And why does it have to be
a water balloon?!

1073
01:07:23,107 --> 01:07:25,776
Isn't there a better way
to do this?!

1074
01:07:27,319 --> 01:07:31,323
It took Lord Fourth three years
to invent this jutsu...

1075
01:07:31,657 --> 01:07:33,868
and another six months
to perfect it.

1076
01:07:34,577 --> 01:07:36,454
Going by how difficult
it is to master,

1077
01:07:36,454 --> 01:07:37,747
this is an A-rank jutsu.

1078
01:07:50,485 --> 01:07:52,862
Damn it!
Still no good!

1079
01:08:05,775 --> 01:08:06,692
I did it!

1080
01:08:07,193 --> 01:08:08,152
Well done!

1081
01:08:08,569 --> 01:08:10,780
Okay, on to the next step.

1082
01:08:12,198 --> 01:08:14,450
What? A rubber ball this time?!

1083
01:08:36,861 --> 01:08:39,822
No! No way... eh!

1084
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:43,453
All right!

1085
01:08:59,428 --> 01:09:01,122
That's awfully small...

1086
01:09:02,414 --> 01:09:05,000
I'd be hard-pressed to call
that Rasengan.

1087
01:09:06,168 --> 01:09:07,086
But the basics are—

1088
01:09:07,128 --> 01:09:08,295
Damn it!

1089
01:09:17,972 --> 01:09:20,057
You're always so strict, Dad.

1090
01:09:20,808 --> 01:09:23,534
Since you probably
don't know Boruto very well,

1091
01:09:24,015 --> 01:09:26,730
let me tell you...
Boruto usually isn't like this.

1092
01:09:27,481 --> 01:09:29,567
It's a miracle
he even managed this far.

1093
01:09:29,567 --> 01:09:31,277
You get it, don't you?

1094
01:09:31,735 --> 01:09:33,237
He jumped to
the wrong conclusion.

1095
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:34,822
I didn't say he failed.

1096
01:09:35,614 --> 01:09:37,783
I was going to accept him
as my student...

1097
01:09:49,086 --> 01:09:51,213
Where did he go anyway?

1098
01:09:53,841 --> 01:09:56,760
Is that right? That's terrible!

1099
01:09:57,411 --> 01:10:00,414
But if that's the case,
I have something perfect for you.

1100
01:10:01,079 --> 01:10:02,080
It's cool...

1101
01:10:02,105 --> 01:10:03,397
and smart...

1102
01:10:03,893 --> 01:10:05,278
and by expending little effort,

1103
01:10:05,303 --> 01:10:07,764
you get exceptionally good results!

1104
01:10:12,983 --> 01:10:17,029
And this ought to be what the ninja
of your generation...

1105
01:10:17,615 --> 01:10:19,575
should look like!

1106
01:10:20,944 --> 01:10:22,904
Wouldn't you agree?

1107
01:10:27,291 --> 01:10:28,876
If you have this...

1108
01:10:28,959 --> 01:10:31,420
Fire Style, Wind Style, and yes,

1109
01:10:31,445 --> 01:10:33,322
the Rasengan is right at your fingertips.

1110
01:10:33,853 --> 01:10:34,607
Now...

1111
01:10:34,632 --> 01:10:39,053
Let's choose the ultimate technique
that's perfect for you, Young Lord!

1112
01:10:54,443 --> 01:10:55,778
I'm managing just fine.

1113
01:10:57,238 --> 01:10:57,905
Uh-huh.

1114
01:10:59,069 --> 01:11:01,363
I see. That's great to hear.

1115
01:11:02,368 --> 01:11:04,161
However, during the Chunin Exams,

1116
01:11:04,298 --> 01:11:07,634
you mustn't reveal
your true strength.

1117
01:11:08,707 --> 01:11:11,543
If you do, you won't be able
to remain there.

1118
01:11:12,517 --> 01:11:13,192
Understand?

1119
01:11:14,088 --> 01:11:15,881
Uh-huh. I know.

1120
01:11:20,678 --> 01:11:21,720
<i>Rasengan!</i>

1121
01:11:28,185 --> 01:11:29,144
Well?

1122
01:11:42,283 --> 01:11:45,327
All that from just one day
of training?

1123
01:11:46,888 --> 01:11:49,474
I'm not like my dad...
when it comes to talent!

1124
01:11:50,582 --> 01:11:53,752
You seem quite different
from Naruto.

1125
01:11:56,027 --> 01:11:58,071
Though I'd hoped it
wasn't the case.

1126
01:11:58,799 --> 01:11:59,425
Huh?

1127
01:12:01,010 --> 01:12:03,095
So? What's your answer?

1128
01:12:03,178 --> 01:12:05,014
In terms of me being
your student?

1129
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:13,737
Fine... You can be my student.

1130
01:12:15,941 --> 01:12:16,942
Yes!

1131
01:12:50,868 --> 01:12:52,036
It's finally time.

1132
01:12:53,633 --> 01:12:54,593
Good luck and do your best!

1133
01:12:54,812 --> 01:12:56,981
You're awfully cheery first thing
in the morning, Mom.

1134
01:12:57,665 --> 01:13:01,086
Does Dad coming home after
a long time make you that happy?

1135
01:13:01,111 --> 01:13:04,740
What? No...
It's nothing like that.

1136
01:13:05,268 --> 01:13:08,634
– What are you saying!
– I can tell these things about you, Mom.

1137
01:13:10,538 --> 01:13:11,706
Anyway, I'm off.

1138
01:13:18,832 --> 01:13:20,626
<i>You seem just as happy, Sarada.</i>

1139
01:13:28,514 --> 01:13:30,933
It seems you won your bet
with my dad, Boruto.

1140
01:13:31,392 --> 01:13:33,060
Huh? Well, yeah.

1141
01:13:35,145 --> 01:13:35,687
So?

1142
01:13:35,771 --> 01:13:38,148
What are you going to do now
that you're his student?

1143
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:41,845
I'm going to ask him about
my dad's weaknesses.

1144
01:13:44,374 --> 01:13:47,669
Look, I'm not criticizing you
or anything, but...

1145
01:13:48,587 --> 01:13:50,964
We've got the Chunin Exams
coming up.

1146
01:13:51,396 --> 01:13:54,524
Don't you realize that this is
no time for something like that?!

1147
01:13:55,006 --> 01:13:56,883
It's all for the Chunin Exams!

1148
01:13:57,167 --> 01:13:59,294
I'm going to learn lots of things
from Uncle Sasuke,

1149
01:13:59,378 --> 01:14:02,131
and I'll show Dad during the Exams.

1150
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:05,901
And in time,
my power's going to take Dad down!

1151
01:14:05,926 --> 01:14:07,719
You mean our power, right?

1152
01:14:08,263 --> 01:14:11,015
Just what are you thinking?!

1153
01:14:11,348 --> 01:14:12,516
What do you mean by "what"?

1154
01:14:12,786 --> 01:14:16,495
It's all about winning
the Chunin Exams with a flair!

1155
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:18,036
Obviously!

1156
01:14:22,668 --> 01:14:25,421
I'm not criticizing you
or anything, but...

1157
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:28,048
there are times when
you don't irritate me.

1158
01:14:28,073 --> 01:14:30,075
Don't forget about me too.

1159
01:14:33,017 --> 01:14:34,310
Mitsuki!

1160
01:14:39,835 --> 01:14:41,336
Done already?

1161
01:14:42,212 --> 01:14:44,047
This time, Cho-Cho you be
the vanguard,

1162
01:14:44,131 --> 01:14:45,591
and Inojin,
you assist from the rear.

1163
01:14:45,883 --> 01:14:49,011
Hey, what's up with
all this eagerness lately?

1164
01:14:49,052 --> 01:14:50,012
What?

1165
01:14:50,361 --> 01:14:52,780
You don't care if you lose
to Boruto's team, then?

1166
01:14:53,204 --> 01:14:54,622
I'm not into that.

1167
01:14:54,797 --> 01:14:58,290
No one wants to see me lose
my composure, do they?

1168
01:14:59,605 --> 01:15:01,523
Then quit complaining and move!

1169
01:15:01,954 --> 01:15:02,624
Here it comes!

1170
01:15:06,153 --> 01:15:08,071
<i>Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll!</i>

1171
01:15:08,697 --> 01:15:10,407
<i>Partial Expansion Jutsu!</i>

1172
01:15:17,164 --> 01:15:18,248
We can do this!

1173
01:15:23,170 --> 01:15:25,172
You were so close!

1174
01:15:31,345 --> 01:15:33,597
That's it for today.

1175
01:15:33,906 --> 01:15:34,740
Damn it!

1176
01:15:34,765 --> 01:15:35,681
Honestly!

1177
01:15:35,706 --> 01:15:37,818
You should've taken this
seriously earlier.

1178
01:15:38,435 --> 01:15:41,313
This time, Gaara's genin
are participating.

1179
01:15:41,897 --> 01:15:43,232
You'll have many rivals.

1180
01:15:43,899 --> 01:15:49,071
The Kazekage, Lord Gaara, is
your younger brother, right, Aunt Temari?

1181
01:15:49,571 --> 01:15:50,364
Yes.

1182
01:15:50,948 --> 01:15:52,741
He adopted a son.

1183
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:54,642
I just met him recently,

1184
01:15:54,667 --> 01:15:56,627
but I sensed extraordinary chakra
from him.

1185
01:15:58,536 --> 01:16:01,497
He was saying he's going to
take part in the Chunin Exams.

1186
01:16:01,928 --> 01:16:04,556
At this rate,
you have no chance against him.

1187
01:16:20,005 --> 01:16:21,382
Ah... damn it!

1188
01:16:21,702 --> 01:16:23,392
The shuriken's not bending at all!

1189
01:16:23,669 --> 01:16:26,297
I can't be wasting time with
this kinda training!

1190
01:16:44,334 --> 01:16:45,794
Wow!

1191
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:49,506
As expected,
this Scientific Ninja Tool is convenient!

1192
01:17:02,348 --> 01:17:04,187
You came here just
to tell me that?

1193
01:17:04,699 --> 01:17:07,702
Your subordinate is going
to be under my care.

1194
01:17:08,542 --> 01:17:10,378
We will need to submit
a notification.

1195
01:17:13,171 --> 01:17:14,172
Thank you very much.

1196
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:18,175
Boruto admires you very much.

1197
01:17:18,994 --> 01:17:21,246
It's the exact opposite of how
he feels about his father, Lord Seventh.

1198
01:17:22,205 --> 01:17:25,751
He probably feels that Lord Seventh
doesn't acknowledge his worth,

1199
01:17:25,893 --> 01:17:27,728
and treats him like a child,

1200
01:17:27,753 --> 01:17:29,087
and is rebelling against him.

1201
01:17:31,298 --> 01:17:34,551
I've never seen Boruto
determined like that ever.

1202
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:37,804
I leave him in your care!

1203
01:17:39,598 --> 01:17:40,307
No...

1204
01:17:41,516 --> 01:17:43,060
When it comes to
raising a child,

1205
01:17:43,101 --> 01:17:45,520
I have no right to
say anything.

1206
01:17:46,563 --> 01:17:48,523
But I'll accept him
as a student.

1207
01:17:51,568 --> 01:17:52,611
Is something the matter?

1208
01:17:53,019 --> 01:17:56,523
You've been good to Sarada.
I thank you for that.

1209
01:18:06,553 --> 01:18:09,889
Hey, tell me everything
about my dad.

1210
01:18:12,714 --> 01:18:14,299
When he was a kid,

1211
01:18:14,446 --> 01:18:16,443
all he did was talk about
becoming the Hokage,

1212
01:18:16,468 --> 01:18:18,220
and he was a total loser.

1213
01:18:18,261 --> 01:18:19,596
A total loser?

1214
01:18:20,389 --> 01:18:22,099
And damned stubborn.

1215
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:23,350
No, not all that!

1216
01:18:23,433 --> 01:18:26,812
What I really want to know about
are his weaknesses.

1217
01:18:27,979 --> 01:18:28,897
Weaknesses?

1218
01:18:29,022 --> 01:18:31,024
Yeah, isn't there something?

1219
01:18:31,686 --> 01:18:35,440
I don't have enough fingers
on my hand to count.

1220
01:18:35,469 --> 01:18:36,011
Huh?

1221
01:18:37,489 --> 01:18:43,286
He was the stereotypical loser,
full of weaknesses.

1222
01:18:46,373 --> 01:18:51,169
But he overcame them with
his own strength, and became the Hokage.

1223
01:18:52,087 --> 01:18:55,006
Maybe instead of
the Naruto of today,

1224
01:18:55,169 --> 01:18:56,962
you should study who
Naruto was in the past.

1225
01:18:59,469 --> 01:19:00,595
What's that supposed to mean?

1226
01:19:08,895 --> 01:19:10,439
Is this one bad too?

1227
01:19:11,206 --> 01:19:12,540
It seems so.

1228
01:19:14,693 --> 01:19:18,113
Not one of Kaguya's scrolls remain.

1229
01:19:19,531 --> 01:19:21,199
Momoshiki-senpai...

1230
01:19:21,616 --> 01:19:24,035
Are you still here?

1231
01:19:24,662 --> 01:19:27,123
How is the search for
the Chakra Fruit going?

1232
01:19:27,365 --> 01:19:30,924
We meet after such a long time,
and that's all you're interested in?

1233
01:19:32,210 --> 01:19:34,921
Yes, yes...
Of course, I checked into that.

1234
01:19:38,467 --> 01:19:41,178
That's the region Kaguya
was in charge of?

1235
01:19:42,139 --> 01:19:44,558
I can't wait to get the chakra.

1236
01:19:46,099 --> 01:19:48,894
J-Just a minute.
You're going already?!

1237
01:19:49,519 --> 01:19:50,687
Hey!

1238
01:19:54,232 --> 01:19:57,819
Oh, Momo,
you're as unsociable as ever.

1239
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:06,169
You're saying the chakra of
the Divine Tree was dispersed and

1240
01:20:06,244 --> 01:20:09,039
became nine monsters?

1241
01:20:09,247 --> 01:20:10,207
Yes.

1242
01:20:10,290 --> 01:20:13,001
They call them Tailed Beasts here.

1243
01:20:13,585 --> 01:20:16,004
And the ones who took these
Tailed Beasts into their bodies

1244
01:20:16,087 --> 01:20:17,714
are known as Jinchuriki.

1245
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:22,344
So "Jinchuriki" possess chakra?

1246
01:20:22,761 --> 01:20:23,720
Yes.

1247
01:20:23,889 --> 01:20:25,433
And for some reason,

1248
01:20:25,458 --> 01:20:28,419
these Jinchuriki have
tremendous chakra.

1249
01:20:28,767 --> 01:20:33,730
So, they keep Tailed Beasts inside
their bodies to amass chakra.

1250
01:20:34,022 --> 01:20:36,399
The people of this region
do very amusing things.

1251
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:39,314
Right now,
there are two Jinchuriki.

1252
01:20:39,402 --> 01:20:43,073
Killer Bee has the Eight-Tails,
and Naruto has the Nine-Tails.

1253
01:20:43,490 --> 01:20:44,783
I see.

1254
01:20:45,075 --> 01:20:48,703
They may be vulgar creatures,
but I do sense enormous chakra.

1255
01:20:51,039 --> 01:20:53,083
At the ruins connected to Kaguya,

1256
01:20:53,166 --> 01:20:55,502
we're beginning to see more and
more movement of White Zetsu.

1257
01:20:55,955 --> 01:20:57,624
The two that Sasuke
reported about,

1258
01:20:57,707 --> 01:21:00,001
who seem to be from
the Otsutsuki Clan...

1259
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:03,552
No matter how you look at it,
they seem to be connected.

1260
01:21:03,784 --> 01:21:06,162
So, in order to resist
some kind of threat,

1261
01:21:06,256 --> 01:21:08,300
Kaguya had prepared
the White Zetsu.

1262
01:21:08,972 --> 01:21:11,558
And now, they've become active.

1263
01:21:12,541 --> 01:21:14,001
The time is near.

1264
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,657
This one is a Jinchuriki?

1265
01:21:25,907 --> 01:21:28,201
He definitely possesses
tremendous chakra.

1266
01:21:28,910 --> 01:21:33,832
Like that Rinnegan fellow,
this one has extraordinary strength.

1267
01:21:34,124 --> 01:21:37,002
That's right, I'm a Jinchuriki ♪

1268
01:21:37,377 --> 01:21:40,046
I have the power of
a hundred men ♪

1269
01:21:40,505 --> 01:21:44,634
Killer Bee of the Eight-Tails,
that's me! ♪

1270
01:21:44,718 --> 01:21:46,094
Aww, yeaah!

1271
01:21:49,431 --> 01:21:50,724
<i>Hey, c'mon.</i>

1272
01:21:50,845 --> 01:21:53,139
<i>They seem to be pretty nasty.</i>

1273
01:21:53,602 --> 01:21:56,271
<i>Are they ignoring me?
For real?</i>

1274
01:21:56,605 --> 01:21:58,106
His words irritate me.

1275
01:21:59,149 --> 01:22:01,318
Now then, I shall take you.

1276
01:22:21,296 --> 01:22:24,132
So this is the Tailed Beast.

1277
01:22:31,806 --> 01:22:32,641
Wha—?

1278
01:22:51,159 --> 01:22:52,280
Imagine that...

1279
01:22:52,305 --> 01:22:56,101
The Chakra Fruit that we seek is
in the form of an unsightly beast.

1280
01:22:56,623 --> 01:22:58,208
<i>Tailed Beast Bomb!</i>

1281
01:22:59,487 --> 01:23:01,280
Can you still move?

1282
01:23:14,891 --> 01:23:18,687
<i>That guy snatched
the Tailed Beast Bomb so easily!</i>

1283
01:23:18,937 --> 01:23:22,857
<i>I was on my way to see Naruto,
but what an obstacle ♪</i>

1284
01:23:23,024 --> 01:23:26,069
<i>When it comes to Tailed Beasts
I'm his mentor ♪</i>

1285
01:23:26,111 --> 01:23:27,904
<i>This is no time to be rapping!</i>

1286
01:23:28,238 --> 01:23:29,531
My, my...

1287
01:23:29,906 --> 01:23:33,201
It seems we have no choice
but to collect them one by one.

1288
01:23:39,833 --> 01:23:41,418
<i>What is that?!</i>

1289
01:23:41,443 --> 01:23:44,212
<i>Magnifying your jutsu
that easily is cheating ♪</i>

1290
01:23:44,704 --> 01:23:47,498
<i>Looks like any victory
is fleeting ♪</i>

1291
01:23:48,133 --> 01:23:50,927
You could say
this is payback, twofold.

1292
01:24:28,506 --> 01:24:30,216
That was easy.

1293
01:24:30,356 --> 01:24:33,609
If Kaguya had produced
a Divine Tree in this region,

1294
01:24:33,678 --> 01:24:36,556
it would've spared us
all this trouble.

1295
01:24:37,307 --> 01:24:42,170
It seems Kaguya developed an attachment
to someone of this planet, and betrayed us.

1296
01:24:42,729 --> 01:24:45,899
Furthermore, it seems
she bore his children.

1297
01:24:48,276 --> 01:24:49,861
The disgrace of our clan!

1298
01:24:50,091 --> 01:24:54,721
That is why the chakra she was supposed
to provide us with never came.

1299
01:24:55,186 --> 01:24:56,228
Yes.

1300
01:24:56,409 --> 01:24:59,704
Kaguya, betrayed us,
and feared our existence.

1301
01:24:59,729 --> 01:25:02,941
It seems she even tried
creating living weapons.

1302
01:25:03,496 --> 01:25:08,292
But she was stopped by her own children
and was sealed away.

1303
01:25:08,838 --> 01:25:09,672
Hmph.

1304
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:14,511
They saved me the trouble of
having to punish Kaguya myself.

1305
01:25:15,055 --> 01:25:18,392
For that, I commend
the vulgar creatures.

1306
01:25:19,474 --> 01:25:20,517
For sure.

1307
01:25:23,478 --> 01:25:25,396
Is this all?

1308
01:25:25,730 --> 01:25:27,107
Now, now...

1309
01:25:27,148 --> 01:25:29,317
There's still one more Jinchuriki.

1310
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:31,778
There's considerable
chakra movement

1311
01:25:31,861 --> 01:25:34,489
coming from an area
not too far from here.

1312
01:25:34,906 --> 01:25:39,869
No doubt this is the massive chakra
we are seeking.

1313
01:25:47,919 --> 01:25:49,629
The Chunin Exams are here at last.

1314
01:25:50,797 --> 01:25:52,590
Are you all ready?

1315
01:25:53,007 --> 01:25:53,925
Yeah!

1316
01:25:55,519 --> 01:25:57,563
We will not dishonor
your name, Father.

1317
01:25:58,138 --> 01:26:01,307
We three will emerge
victorious without fail.

1318
01:26:02,356 --> 01:26:03,941
Don't get too worked up, Shinki.

1319
01:26:05,770 --> 01:26:08,106
I'm not the one you should
be focusing on.

1320
01:26:08,731 --> 01:26:11,401
It's your rivals from other villages
that you've yet to meet.

1321
01:26:12,026 --> 01:26:13,570
Other villages don't matter.

1322
01:26:15,446 --> 01:26:16,531
Well, never mind.

1323
01:26:17,031 --> 01:26:20,869
In any case, make sure to get
good rest on the Thunder Train.

1324
01:26:21,119 --> 01:26:21,828
– Yes!
– Right!

1325
01:26:23,872 --> 01:26:25,039
Take care of them.

1326
01:26:25,623 --> 01:26:28,001
I'll set out as soon as
I complete my duties here.

1327
01:26:28,751 --> 01:26:31,754
I should reach the Hidden Leaf Village
around the time Round Two begins.

1328
01:26:32,505 --> 01:26:33,715
Yeah, I know.

1329
01:26:34,507 --> 01:26:37,010
I'll visit Temari when I get there.

1330
01:26:37,510 --> 01:26:38,303
Yeah.

1331
01:26:45,935 --> 01:26:47,103
<i>Gaara!</i>

1332
01:26:48,271 --> 01:26:50,732
This voice... Is that you, Shukaku?

1333
01:26:51,936 --> 01:26:53,104
<i>It's been a while.</i>

1334
01:26:53,776 --> 01:26:56,696
<i>You never initiate contact.</i>

1335
01:26:57,971 --> 01:27:00,307
<i>Which means that it's important.</i>

1336
01:27:00,783 --> 01:27:03,703
<i>My connection with the Eight-Tails
was suddenly cut off.</i>

1337
01:27:03,870 --> 01:27:05,955
<i>Something definitely happened.</i>

1338
01:27:06,623 --> 01:27:08,833
<i>Is it only with the Eight-Tails?</i>

1339
01:27:09,209 --> 01:27:10,210
<i>Yeah.</i>

1340
01:27:10,251 --> 01:27:13,296
<i>I'm still connected with Naruto
and the others.</i>

1341
01:27:13,504 --> 01:27:16,049
<i>But I'm getting a bad feeling
about this...</i>

1342
01:27:16,074 --> 01:27:16,825
<i>I see.</i>

1343
01:27:17,133 --> 01:27:19,969
<i>So anyway, I warned you.</i>

1344
01:27:20,053 --> 01:27:21,930
<i>How you deal with this
is up to you.</i>

1345
01:27:22,055 --> 01:27:23,973
<i>I'm grateful, my friend.</i>

1346
01:27:37,153 --> 01:27:38,196
All right!

1347
01:27:38,713 --> 01:27:40,882
You're starting to be able
to bend it a little.

1348
01:27:41,282 --> 01:27:42,200
That one's next.

1349
01:27:44,702 --> 01:27:46,829
Now go around that one
and hit that target.

1350
01:27:47,216 --> 01:27:49,385
No way! It's impossible!

1351
01:27:49,582 --> 01:27:51,960
How do you expect me
to do that and hit the target?

1352
01:27:59,008 --> 01:28:00,051
No fair!

1353
01:28:00,161 --> 01:28:02,388
I mean, if I had that,
even I could have—!

1354
01:28:02,553 --> 01:28:04,305
That was just one example.

1355
01:28:04,973 --> 01:28:06,891
There are countless other ways.

1356
01:28:07,431 --> 01:28:09,100
Use your head a little more
and think.

1357
01:28:09,727 --> 01:28:11,354
Don't try to find
an answer instantly.

1358
01:28:14,315 --> 01:28:15,275
I know that...

1359
01:28:20,571 --> 01:28:23,908
<i>You will definitely win, Young Lord.</i>

1360
01:28:28,930 --> 01:28:30,348
<i>Don't worry.</i>

1361
01:28:30,628 --> 01:28:33,893
<i>When you're in a bind, the Scientific
Ninja Tool will come to your rescue.</i>

1362
01:28:34,636 --> 01:28:36,513
<i>There's no need to worry.</i>

1363
01:28:51,227 --> 01:28:53,146
Tomorrow's the Chunin Exams...

1364
01:28:56,786 --> 01:28:58,585
I swear I'm not going to lose!

1365
01:29:02,697 --> 01:29:04,490
Do your best, Big Brother!

1366
01:29:04,949 --> 01:29:06,826
Stay calm while you take the test.

1367
01:29:07,544 --> 01:29:09,880
If you haven't forgotten the things
you've learned until today,

1368
01:29:09,996 --> 01:29:11,539
you'll definitely pass!

1369
01:29:11,873 --> 01:29:13,291
Yeah, I know!

1370
01:29:21,257 --> 01:29:23,676
<i>Oh well, just in case...</i>

1371
01:29:27,898 --> 01:29:29,775
Okay, I'll be going, ya know!

1372
01:29:30,224 --> 01:29:31,726
Bye!

1373
01:29:36,356 --> 01:29:37,815
Oh, here they come!

1374
01:29:38,524 --> 01:29:39,525
Hey!

1375
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:44,947
You look like you're ready to go.

1376
01:29:44,989 --> 01:29:46,324
What happened?

1377
01:29:47,079 --> 01:29:50,541
Until recently, you were sounding like
Shikadai, saying how it was going to be drag...

1378
01:29:50,870 --> 01:29:51,913
Right?

1379
01:29:52,121 --> 01:29:54,415
I don't know what caused
the change of heart.

1380
01:29:55,333 --> 01:29:56,334
I told you!

1381
01:29:56,918 --> 01:29:59,128
I'll show everyone
the fruits of my training.

1382
01:29:59,754 --> 01:30:01,714
Looks like everyone else
is here too.

1383
01:30:02,215 --> 01:30:03,216
Hey!

1384
01:30:03,257 --> 01:30:04,384
Let's all do our best!

1385
01:30:04,592 --> 01:30:06,886
I'm so nervous!

1386
01:30:12,642 --> 01:30:14,894
None of them seem like
they're too eager.

1387
01:30:15,186 --> 01:30:17,105
You can't really tell
just by looking at them.

1388
01:30:18,482 --> 01:30:20,776
Oh, all three of them
have the same face!

1389
01:30:21,234 --> 01:30:23,319
They're from the Hidden Mist.

1390
01:30:23,903 --> 01:30:24,904
Their names are...

1391
01:30:25,238 --> 01:30:28,991
Takanami, Sazanami
and Makinami Senka...

1392
01:30:29,534 --> 01:30:30,743
Triplets?

1393
01:30:31,119 --> 01:30:32,995
I wonder what kind of
ninja arts they use?

1394
01:30:33,541 --> 01:30:36,961
Which team looks
strong to you, Iwabe?

1395
01:30:37,417 --> 01:30:38,793
Well...

1396
01:30:49,762 --> 01:30:54,350
They look like they've got
some hidden strengths.

1397
01:30:55,268 --> 01:30:57,520
They could end up as our rivals.

1398
01:30:58,479 --> 01:31:01,315
The Genbu Shinobi Trio
representing the Hidden Stone!

1399
01:31:01,691 --> 01:31:04,694
Their background and the ninja arts
they use are a total mystery...

1400
01:31:05,027 --> 01:31:09,782
They look super strong!
Do you even think we can win?

1401
01:31:10,491 --> 01:31:11,617
Calm down!

1402
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:18,245
Compared to the guys we've had to
fight up to now, they're nothing.

1403
01:31:18,624 --> 01:31:21,085
Damn it, he always
gets so carried away!

1404
01:31:22,712 --> 01:31:24,297
<i>So, that's Boruto Uzumaki.</i>

1405
01:31:25,298 --> 01:31:29,719
<i>The son of the Seventh Hokage, Naruto
Uzumaki, who defeated Father in the past...</i>

1406
01:31:30,803 --> 01:31:32,472
What's going on, Shinki?

1407
01:31:33,556 --> 01:31:34,557
It's nothing.

1408
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:35,428
Let's go.

1409
01:31:35,707 --> 01:31:37,417
The opening ceremony
will begin soon.

1410
01:31:42,023 --> 01:31:43,149
Quiet!

1411
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:44,817
Looks like everyone is here.

1412
01:31:45,776 --> 01:31:46,777
We will now begin

1413
01:31:46,819 --> 01:31:50,531
the first Chunin Exams of
the Five Allied Villages!

1414
01:31:53,826 --> 01:31:57,830
As you all know, this is the first
selection exam in history

1415
01:31:57,914 --> 01:32:00,208
sponsored by all five villages.

1416
01:32:00,917 --> 01:32:01,918
The Hidden Leaf.

1417
01:32:02,126 --> 01:32:03,252
The Hidden Cloud.

1418
01:32:03,419 --> 01:32:04,420
The Hidden Mist.

1419
01:32:04,587 --> 01:32:05,588
The Hidden Stone.

1420
01:32:05,838 --> 01:32:07,131
And the Hidden Sand.

1421
01:32:07,882 --> 01:32:10,795
At this time, you are all getting
the rare opportunity

1422
01:32:10,820 --> 01:32:13,535
to fight against ninja
from other villages.

1423
01:32:14,148 --> 01:32:17,693
This is your chance to use
the jutsu that you're proud of!

1424
01:32:21,905 --> 01:32:23,282
<i>Good grief...</i>

1425
01:32:23,481 --> 01:32:24,732
<i>Are they even motivated</i>

1426
01:32:24,815 --> 01:32:26,901
<i>to participate in
this important event?</i>

1427
01:32:28,152 --> 01:32:30,404
Everyone, I ask you
to freely demonstrate

1428
01:32:30,488 --> 01:32:31,864
the fruits of your training!

1429
01:32:32,114 --> 01:32:33,824
– Right!
– All right!

1430
01:32:34,283 --> 01:32:39,163
Exam One will begin promptly
at noon in Exam Venue A.

1431
01:32:39,789 --> 01:32:46,921
Until then, the time is yours.
Use that time to rest or train!

1432
01:32:47,630 --> 01:32:48,631
Dismissed!

1433
01:32:50,049 --> 01:32:52,927
Two Chunin Exam
Cheer burger combos, correct?

1434
01:32:53,844 --> 01:32:55,054
So? What's going on?

1435
01:32:55,304 --> 01:32:57,265
Burgers again? On a day like this?

1436
01:32:59,767 --> 01:33:02,353
They say you can't wage war hungry!

1437
01:33:02,562 --> 01:33:05,982
Well, there's still time
until the first exam.

1438
01:33:06,482 --> 01:33:08,192
This can be our strategy meeting.

1439
01:33:09,068 --> 01:33:11,320
Yeah, but Mitsuki is late...

1440
01:33:11,862 --> 01:33:13,155
I wonder what he's doing?

1441
01:33:15,803 --> 01:33:18,139
These guys were at
the opening ceremony...

1442
01:33:22,582 --> 01:33:25,167
Hey, you mind switching with us?

1443
01:33:25,626 --> 01:33:26,627
Huh?

1444
01:33:27,257 --> 01:33:30,719
There's only two of you.
We've got three.

1445
01:33:31,570 --> 01:33:32,737
It's only natural

1446
01:33:32,842 --> 01:33:35,344
to seat the larger party
at the booth, right?

1447
01:33:35,553 --> 01:33:37,305
We have three too.

1448
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:39,098
One of us isn't here yet.

1449
01:33:39,247 --> 01:33:41,124
That's none of our concern.

1450
01:33:41,267 --> 01:33:43,519
It's his fault for being slow.

1451
01:33:44,316 --> 01:33:48,403
There you have it.
So, if you get it, move.

1452
01:33:48,735 --> 01:33:51,988
You can't be ninja
if you're slow like that.

1453
01:33:52,361 --> 01:33:53,362
What?!

1454
01:33:53,988 --> 01:33:55,072
No, Boruto!

1455
01:33:55,315 --> 01:33:56,900
Don't make trouble
before the exams.

1456
01:33:57,116 --> 01:33:58,117
Boruto?

1457
01:33:58,618 --> 01:33:59,994
Oh, I see...

1458
01:34:00,244 --> 01:34:02,955
You're the son of
the Seventh Hokage...

1459
01:34:03,581 --> 01:34:05,833
I was curious to see
how good a ninja you were...

1460
01:34:06,473 --> 01:34:08,613
Who woulda thought
you'd be such a weakling?

1461
01:34:08,638 --> 01:34:09,764
Why you—!

1462
01:34:11,890 --> 01:34:12,596
Huh?

1463
01:34:15,437 --> 01:34:17,231
That's my seat.

1464
01:34:17,475 --> 01:34:18,976
Who the hell are you?!

1465
01:34:29,148 --> 01:34:32,276
Why are you
staring at me like that?!

1466
01:34:33,944 --> 01:34:36,322
Boruto, how are these guys—?

1467
01:34:39,659 --> 01:34:40,660
What's—!!

1468
01:34:41,160 --> 01:34:42,161
My body's...

1469
01:34:42,453 --> 01:34:43,454
What's going on...

1470
01:34:47,725 --> 01:34:48,726
That's enough.

1471
01:34:49,335 --> 01:34:50,670
<i>Who are these guys?</i>

1472
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:52,421
<i>What's with that cape?</i>

1473
01:34:53,839 --> 01:34:56,175
What's the point of fighting here?

1474
01:35:00,596 --> 01:35:02,556
Sorry, our third member's here now.

1475
01:35:03,557 --> 01:35:04,975
Could you please
find a seat elsewhere?

1476
01:35:06,435 --> 01:35:07,603
Whatever.

1477
01:35:09,361 --> 01:35:11,863
We'll see you at the Exams.

1478
01:35:15,903 --> 01:35:18,739
Um... Thank you!
You were a big help.

1479
01:35:19,312 --> 01:35:20,688
No worries.

1480
01:35:20,908 --> 01:35:22,993
Shinki's like that.

1481
01:35:23,436 --> 01:35:24,271
Let's go.

1482
01:35:24,495 --> 01:35:25,454
Right!

1483
01:35:29,276 --> 01:35:30,277
Shinki, huh?

1484
01:35:30,956 --> 01:35:32,207
Who is he anyway?

1485
01:35:32,461 --> 01:35:35,464
Oh, um...
Ah, it's right here.

1486
01:35:35,951 --> 01:35:38,954
Shinki... representing
the Hidden Sand Village.

1487
01:35:39,719 --> 01:35:40,326
Oh...

1488
01:35:40,803 --> 01:35:43,389
Seems he's the adopted son
of the Fifth Kazekage.

1489
01:35:44,598 --> 01:35:45,975
The son of one of the Five Kage.

1490
01:35:46,604 --> 01:35:48,814
He's just like you, Boruto.

1491
01:35:49,904 --> 01:35:50,905
Kazekage?

1492
01:35:51,751 --> 01:35:52,752
It's him, huh—?

1493
01:35:59,519 --> 01:36:01,021
Hey, there Tsuchikage!

1494
01:36:02,324 --> 01:36:06,412
You're awfully eager
to watch from the first exam.

1495
01:36:06,954 --> 01:36:08,122
Same to you guys.

1496
01:36:08,748 --> 01:36:11,917
Well, it is history's first
joint exam of the five villages.

1497
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:17,419
I wonder how many genin
will be worth watching this time.

1498
01:36:18,007 --> 01:36:20,301
It's nice that we're
at peace these days,

1499
01:36:20,593 --> 01:36:23,637
but as a result, the number
of chunin has decreased.

1500
01:36:24,638 --> 01:36:27,975
We need new blood from these exams.

1501
01:36:28,768 --> 01:36:32,188
By the way, is the Kazekage,
Gaara, not coming?

1502
01:36:32,639 --> 01:36:34,098
The exam has already begun.

1503
01:36:34,690 --> 01:36:36,692
He should be on his way now.

1504
01:36:37,193 --> 01:36:38,944
Oh, we're all here now.

1505
01:36:40,112 --> 01:36:41,655
It's about to start.

1506
01:36:44,784 --> 01:36:46,869
Okay, I see everyone's here?

1507
01:36:47,787 --> 01:36:50,915
I will now announce the outline
of the first round.

1508
01:36:52,917 --> 01:36:53,918
The exam for Round One is...

1509
01:37:03,636 --> 01:37:04,845
a true or false quiz.

1510
01:37:11,031 --> 01:37:12,032
Huh...?

1511
01:37:12,342 --> 01:37:14,344
– Huh?!
– Huh?!

1512
01:37:14,753 --> 01:37:16,588
What is this?

1513
01:37:16,613 --> 01:37:18,031
A quiz?

1514
01:37:18,216 --> 01:37:21,469
The question will be given
in Exam Venue B

1515
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:23,103
which is 20 km from here.

1516
01:37:24,156 --> 01:37:27,284
Any genin who does not
arrive at the venue

1517
01:37:27,326 --> 01:37:29,995
within one hour of this stopwatch
will be disqualified.

1518
01:37:30,623 --> 01:37:34,043
Furthermore, along the way,
various traps have been laid.

1519
01:37:35,204 --> 01:37:37,372
If you get caught up
and can go no further, it means...

1520
01:37:37,561 --> 01:37:38,771
– you're disqualified as well.
– Boruto! Look!

1521
01:37:40,183 --> 01:37:42,977
Only participants who arrive at
Venue B within the time allotted

1522
01:37:43,126 --> 01:37:44,419
– will be allowed to take
– That stopwatch

1523
01:37:44,444 --> 01:37:45,612
– the true or false quiz...
– is moving!

1524
01:37:45,719 --> 01:37:46,720
– so please pay attention
– Let's run!

1525
01:37:46,745 --> 01:37:47,955
to the time.

1526
01:37:48,764 --> 01:37:51,684
Any team who is late,
even by a second, will be—

1527
01:37:58,877 --> 01:38:01,672
Oh... I wasn't done explaining...

1528
01:38:02,528 --> 01:38:05,489
Your explanation itself is a trap.

1529
01:38:05,739 --> 01:38:08,701
If they listened until the end,
they wouldn't have made it in time.

1530
01:38:09,142 --> 01:38:11,144
At least they can
figure out that much.

1531
01:38:12,297 --> 01:38:14,674
This year's participants
are an elite group.

1532
01:38:15,436 --> 01:38:16,952
I would hope so.

1533
01:38:19,253 --> 01:38:20,379
Oh boy...

1534
01:38:20,655 --> 01:38:22,699
It's our first joint exams ever...

1535
01:38:23,912 --> 01:38:26,623
But he has no intention of
making this easy for any of them.

1536
01:38:32,944 --> 01:38:34,946
This is an exam,
and it's also a serious battle.

1537
01:38:35,519 --> 01:38:36,979
I won't be going easy on you, okay?

1538
01:38:41,416 --> 01:38:42,793
Traps have been laid!

1539
01:38:43,235 --> 01:38:44,528
Be careful as you proceed!

1540
01:38:54,830 --> 01:38:57,082
Seems the time's come
to show them what we're made of.

1541
01:38:57,666 --> 01:39:00,961
The ultimate technique of us,
the Genbu Trio!

1542
01:39:01,344 --> 01:39:04,180
<i>Ninja Art: Genbu Winter Wind
Emperor Formation!</i>

1543
01:39:04,663 --> 01:39:06,498
<i>Number 108 – Release!</i>

1544
01:39:07,062 --> 01:39:09,147
<i>Respond to my name and manifest!</i>

1545
01:39:09,355 --> 01:39:10,367
<i>Jet black—!</i>

1546
01:39:27,241 --> 01:39:29,869
We couldn't see
their ultimate technique...

1547
01:39:30,362 --> 01:39:32,739
What was he saying at the end?

1548
01:39:34,957 --> 01:39:36,000
L-Let's go!

1549
01:39:36,583 --> 01:39:38,334
Nothing much we can say to losers...

1550
01:39:40,709 --> 01:39:41,961
So uncool.

1551
01:39:42,252 --> 01:39:43,837
Those three!

1552
01:39:43,883 --> 01:39:44,744
When they get back home

1553
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:46,121
they're going to start training
again from the very beginning.

1554
01:39:46,146 --> 01:39:47,773
I'll see to it, personally.

1555
01:39:55,570 --> 01:39:58,907
These traps
aren't worth using this...

1556
01:39:59,513 --> 01:40:01,515
Oh... Not bad at all.

1557
01:40:01,874 --> 01:40:03,375
Then how about this?

1558
01:40:11,537 --> 01:40:13,205
Try not to use your jutsu.

1559
01:40:13,900 --> 01:40:16,570
No need to show
the enemy our skills.

1560
01:40:17,048 --> 01:40:18,049
– Got it.
– Right!

1561
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:40,006
Easy!

1562
01:40:40,561 --> 01:40:43,188
<i>And... I still have more
tricks up my sleeve...</i>

1563
01:40:48,610 --> 01:40:50,779
Let's go, Sazanami, Makinami.

1564
01:40:50,904 --> 01:40:52,114
Yes, Elder Brother.

1565
01:40:52,156 --> 01:40:53,365
I'm ready anytime.

1566
01:41:16,406 --> 01:41:17,991
We took a lot of time.

1567
01:41:18,637 --> 01:41:20,430
We made it with
five minutes to spare.

1568
01:41:24,541 --> 01:41:25,542
Damn it!

1569
01:41:25,713 --> 01:41:27,674
Look at them with
their unconcerned expressions!

1570
01:41:29,169 --> 01:41:31,421
There's more left than I thought.

1571
01:41:31,566 --> 01:41:33,652
Still, it's what we speculated.

1572
01:41:34,327 --> 01:41:37,664
Well, the real exam starts now.

1573
01:41:43,107 --> 01:41:44,484
Each team of three

1574
01:41:44,605 --> 01:41:49,694
will stand on the side they believe
is the correct answer.

1575
01:41:50,042 --> 01:41:52,377
So, it really is
a true or false quiz!

1576
01:41:52,633 --> 01:41:55,427
They sure prepared
some elaborate steps to this...

1577
01:41:55,713 --> 01:41:58,257
Those who answer incorrectly,
namely...

1578
01:41:59,071 --> 01:42:00,948
those who turn black, will fail.

1579
01:42:01,436 --> 01:42:02,437
Turn black?

1580
01:42:03,059 --> 01:42:04,101
All right, here's the question.

1581
01:42:05,452 --> 01:42:07,913
In the 5th Volume of the Shinobi
Military Strategy Handbook,

1582
01:42:07,947 --> 01:42:09,240
the following passwords appear:

1583
01:42:09,557 --> 01:42:13,603
Moon is day. Mountain is river.
Flower is nectar.

1584
01:42:13,922 --> 01:42:15,007
True or false?

1585
01:42:15,467 --> 01:42:17,052
How am I supposed to know that?!

1586
01:42:17,077 --> 01:42:19,622
Umm...
What was it?!

1587
01:42:19,769 --> 01:42:22,397
I don't remember three passwords...

1588
01:42:26,192 --> 01:42:28,111
Sarada, are you familiar
with that book?

1589
01:42:28,651 --> 01:42:29,694
I've read it.

1590
01:42:29,995 --> 01:42:31,287
But the library only had up to

1591
01:42:31,312 --> 01:42:34,565
the 4th Volume of
the Military Strategy Handbook.

1592
01:42:35,538 --> 01:42:37,791
Who knew there was a fifth scroll...!

1593
01:42:37,953 --> 01:42:39,371
What about you, Mitsuki?

1594
01:42:42,421 --> 01:42:44,799
I guess we'll just have to
go by instinct.

1595
01:42:46,364 --> 01:42:48,241
<i>I guess this will be of no use
in a quiz.</i>

1596
01:42:55,128 --> 01:42:58,381
Damn it! We have to hurry up
and decide or we'll fail!

1597
01:42:58,696 --> 01:43:02,158
Boruto, which one do you think
my dad would choose?

1598
01:43:02,183 --> 01:43:04,185
Huh? What's up with that question?

1599
01:43:04,579 --> 01:43:05,580
Just answer.

1600
01:43:08,390 --> 01:43:09,724
False, I think.

1601
01:43:10,505 --> 01:43:12,966
Sasuke doesn't seem to be
the straightforward type.

1602
01:43:13,210 --> 01:43:15,962
Right? I think so too.

1603
01:43:19,466 --> 01:43:22,636
I'm choosing a different path than
Dad and I'll become the Hokage.

1604
01:43:23,595 --> 01:43:25,222
Then, we'll choose true?

1605
01:43:25,809 --> 01:43:26,460
Yes.

1606
01:43:26,859 --> 01:43:29,236
Will you go along with me, guys?

1607
01:43:29,837 --> 01:43:33,633
This is fun!
Thinking will get us nowhere.

1608
01:43:34,197 --> 01:43:35,948
Let's just take a gamble, Sarada!

1609
01:43:47,522 --> 01:43:48,523
Time's up.

1610
01:43:49,197 --> 01:43:50,198
The correct answer is...

1611
01:44:00,472 --> 01:44:02,474
It's ink! A pool of ink!

1612
01:44:02,981 --> 01:44:05,817
<i>Did we fail?</i>

1613
01:44:06,629 --> 01:44:08,673
<i>Damn it... here?!</i>

1614
01:44:09,465 --> 01:44:11,341
<i>Does it all end here?!</i>

1615
01:44:17,241 --> 01:44:20,410
<i>They failed over there too?!
What's the right answer?</i>

1616
01:44:21,465 --> 01:44:23,342
<i>Those who turn black, will fail.</i>

1617
01:44:24,159 --> 01:44:25,049
Mitsuki!

1618
01:44:28,087 --> 01:44:29,088
Boruto!

1619
01:44:32,626 --> 01:44:33,752
So that's it!

1620
01:44:39,899 --> 01:44:41,026
We barely made it.

1621
01:44:51,268 --> 01:44:52,394
I see...

1622
01:44:53,092 --> 01:44:55,803
It didn't matter
if we chose true or false.

1623
01:44:56,409 --> 01:44:58,912
That quiz was a sham
from the start.

1624
01:44:59,253 --> 01:45:01,547
There was never really
a fifth volume at all.

1625
01:45:01,928 --> 01:45:04,556
"Those who turn black will fail..."

1626
01:45:05,430 --> 01:45:06,848
That's what he said.

1627
01:45:07,587 --> 01:45:09,756
You're okay
if you didn't turn black.

1628
01:45:10,058 --> 01:45:12,686
You pass if you didn't fall into
the pool of ink.

1629
01:45:13,259 --> 01:45:15,053
So that's what he meant.

1630
01:45:15,229 --> 01:45:18,941
Man... It's exactly the kinda
crappy test my dad would think up.

1631
01:45:21,037 --> 01:45:22,038
Exactly!

1632
01:45:23,064 --> 01:45:25,150
Some looked at
the approaching pool of ink

1633
01:45:25,226 --> 01:45:28,563
and realized that they made
the wrong choice...

1634
01:45:29,437 --> 01:45:31,564
and just chose to let
the ink stain them.

1635
01:45:32,075 --> 01:45:35,328
If you're that gutless,
you don't deserve to become chunin.

1636
01:45:37,858 --> 01:45:40,652
The real purpose of the first test...

1637
01:45:41,239 --> 01:45:42,372
was to see what you
decided to do the instant you

1638
01:45:42,396 --> 01:45:43,525
realized you were backed
into a difficult situation.

1639
01:45:44,297 --> 01:45:46,258
Do you "give up" or do you
"refuse to give up"?

1640
01:45:47,610 --> 01:45:49,946
Those who did not fall into the ink
made the right choice.

1641
01:45:51,218 --> 01:45:54,305
The first round of the Chunin Exams
has now ended!

1642
01:46:00,130 --> 01:46:01,590
Round Two is in three days.

1643
01:46:01,644 --> 01:46:02,728
Let's do our best!

1644
01:46:02,977 --> 01:46:03,978
Of course!

1645
01:46:04,015 --> 01:46:05,683
We're going to pass the next one,
no matter what!

1646
01:46:06,069 --> 01:46:07,112
Right, Boruto?

1647
01:46:07,694 --> 01:46:09,738
Huh? Y-Yeah...

1648
01:46:09,983 --> 01:46:11,276
For sure!

1649
01:46:11,796 --> 01:46:13,673
Hah, you sure can talk big.

1650
01:46:15,508 --> 01:46:18,719
You were helpless
without the other two.

1651
01:46:18,930 --> 01:46:20,098
What did you say?

1652
01:46:22,154 --> 01:46:23,990
Shinki? What's the matter?

1653
01:46:24,279 --> 01:46:25,530
No, it's nothing.

1654
01:46:27,689 --> 01:46:30,984
Yes, it seems he didn't have
an opportunity to use it this time.

1655
01:46:31,745 --> 01:46:36,792
Yes, if he's going to use it,
it should be on a bigger stage...

1656
01:46:44,113 --> 01:46:47,074
Looks like Boruto's team
made it through round one.

1657
01:46:47,719 --> 01:46:48,720
I see.

1658
01:46:50,055 --> 01:46:52,265
Maybe you should say
a few words to him...

1659
01:46:56,311 --> 01:46:57,312
Yeah.

1660
01:47:05,713 --> 01:47:08,716
Big Brother, dinner's ready!

1661
01:47:09,138 --> 01:47:12,141
He's exhausted.
Let's let him sleep.

1662
01:47:12,690 --> 01:47:13,691
Uh-huh.

1663
01:47:26,883 --> 01:47:29,302
<i>Congratulations on passing
the First Round!</i>

1664
01:47:29,761 --> 01:47:32,472
<i>Do your best on the Second Round!
— From Dad.</i>

1665
01:47:33,432 --> 01:47:34,724
An email?

1666
01:47:35,225 --> 01:47:38,061
He didn't even send a Shadow Clone?
Stupid old man.

1667
01:48:01,670 --> 01:48:02,671
You just watch...

1668
01:48:03,568 --> 01:48:05,946
I'll show you in the second round,
for sure.

1669
01:48:06,365 --> 01:48:09,577
And I'll make you acknowledge me,
no matter what!

1670
01:48:20,061 --> 01:48:21,313
You're late.

1671
01:48:21,897 --> 01:48:24,149
You were both too early,
that's all.

1672
01:48:24,608 --> 01:48:26,443
So? What did you want
to talk about?

1673
01:48:28,138 --> 01:48:29,931
I was attacked.

1674
01:48:32,657 --> 01:48:34,743
It was on the way to
Hidden Leaf Village.

1675
01:48:43,877 --> 01:48:45,921
There should have been
a barrier placed...

1676
01:48:46,213 --> 01:48:49,925
Oh, you mean that
thin paper-like thing?

1677
01:48:50,300 --> 01:48:51,343
You must be the one...

1678
01:48:51,510 --> 01:48:53,136
who attacked the Eight-Tails.

1679
01:48:53,828 --> 01:48:54,995
Eight-Tails?

1680
01:48:55,263 --> 01:48:57,766
Oh, my superiors did that.

1681
01:48:58,308 --> 01:49:01,269
I understand you once
had one inside of you, too.

1682
01:49:01,394 --> 01:49:04,314
Wasn't it called the One Tail?

1683
01:49:10,905 --> 01:49:12,323
I got you.

1684
01:49:17,702 --> 01:49:20,914
Hmm... How very primitive.

1685
01:49:21,289 --> 01:49:23,375
What's that called? Willpower?

1686
01:49:23,583 --> 01:49:26,002
Honestly, it's not very effective.

1687
01:49:26,211 --> 01:49:27,546
Why you...!

1688
01:49:27,712 --> 01:49:29,589
Well, no matter.

1689
01:49:29,619 --> 01:49:31,496
Lord Kazekage!
What happened?!

1690
01:49:31,553 --> 01:49:32,762
Huh?! Who are you?!

1691
01:49:32,884 --> 01:49:33,885
Oops.

1692
01:49:34,302 --> 01:49:36,555
Oh well, I got what I was fishing for...

1693
01:49:36,613 --> 01:49:38,573
So, I'll excuse myself now.

1694
01:49:47,152 --> 01:49:49,571
It was probably the Otsutsuki Clan.

1695
01:49:50,023 --> 01:49:51,608
The same as Kaguya's clan?

1696
01:49:53,889 --> 01:49:56,641
The scroll that I retrieved
from Kaguya's palace

1697
01:49:56,825 --> 01:49:58,577
is being deciphered right now.

1698
01:49:59,327 --> 01:50:03,707
He was already aware that Shukaku
is no longer inside me...

1699
01:50:04,541 --> 01:50:05,542
I see...

1700
01:50:05,625 --> 01:50:08,086
I guess there's no choice
but to postpone the Chunin Exams.

1701
01:50:08,474 --> 01:50:12,979
But the Feudal Lords, who were
once bitter foes in the past,

1702
01:50:13,275 --> 01:50:14,985
are also joint sponsors.

1703
01:50:15,010 --> 01:50:16,803
These exams have
important significance.

1704
01:50:17,137 --> 01:50:17,846
Yes.

1705
01:50:17,929 --> 01:50:21,349
The current climate of uncertainty is
precisely what they're targeting,

1706
01:50:21,374 --> 01:50:23,292
so to postpone
the exams now will...

1707
01:50:24,102 --> 01:50:28,273
seriously damage the reputation of
the Land of Fire as well as the Hokage's.

1708
01:50:28,561 --> 01:50:29,729
And, should that happen,

1709
01:50:29,899 --> 01:50:33,528
the hardliners in my village will
also try to exert their power.

1710
01:50:33,991 --> 01:50:35,493
I'd like to try and avoid that.

1711
01:50:35,947 --> 01:50:37,907
Governing is so annoying.

1712
01:50:38,557 --> 01:50:39,975
Then, it's all the more reason

1713
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:42,912
to hurry with the deciphering
of the scroll...

1714
01:50:44,331 --> 01:50:45,373
What a headache...

1715
01:50:45,707 --> 01:50:49,919
If only we could be
at ground zero like Sasuke.

1716
01:50:50,205 --> 01:50:51,290
Perhaps you're right.

1717
01:50:52,797 --> 01:50:53,798
How is your injury?

1718
01:50:53,882 --> 01:50:55,800
Don't misjudge me, Mizukage.

1719
01:50:56,092 --> 01:50:58,011
It takes much more to hurt me.

1720
01:50:58,345 --> 01:50:59,846
This is nothing.

1721
01:51:00,829 --> 01:51:02,206
I understand...

1722
01:51:14,382 --> 01:51:17,733
Everyone knows Shuriken Jutsu
is Sarada's specialty!

1723
01:51:18,114 --> 01:51:19,783
I mean... she's your...

1724
01:51:19,808 --> 01:51:21,852
She's an Uchiha, after all!

1725
01:51:22,285 --> 01:51:24,996
By that logic, Boruto...

1726
01:51:28,375 --> 01:51:31,503
This jutsu should be
your specialty too.

1727
01:51:31,586 --> 01:51:32,545
I guess so...

1728
01:51:32,587 --> 01:51:34,923
This was Dad's specialty, right?

1729
01:51:35,215 --> 01:51:36,716
You can't make any more excuses.

1730
01:51:37,258 --> 01:51:39,594
Naruto can make over
a thousand Shadow Clones.

1731
01:51:40,845 --> 01:51:41,930
I know that!

1732
01:51:43,826 --> 01:51:46,620
<i>I'll blow them away
during Round Two!</i>

1733
01:51:47,960 --> 01:51:49,275
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

1734
01:51:52,732 --> 01:51:55,068
I guess four is still my limit.

1735
01:52:00,482 --> 01:52:02,609
<i>Round Two consists
of capturing a flag.</i>

1736
01:52:02,858 --> 01:52:06,513
<i>Guard the flag in your territory
while you invade enemy territory.</i>

1737
01:52:06,538 --> 01:52:08,123
<i>In other words, this is an offensive
and defensive battle!</i>

1738
01:52:08,493 --> 01:52:10,496
<i>It's three against three, so</i>

1739
01:52:10,521 --> 01:52:14,108
<i>half the teams will be dropped
after this round.</i>

1740
01:52:40,780 --> 01:52:43,158
Most of the matches are over.

1741
01:52:44,159 --> 01:52:47,579
There's just one set of teams left.

1742
01:52:48,580 --> 01:52:50,540
I don't see the enemy,
are we okay?

1743
01:52:51,306 --> 01:52:54,518
I'm guarding our flag.
So relax and just attack!

1744
01:52:56,671 --> 01:52:58,047
We're counting on you, Boruto!

1745
01:52:58,757 --> 01:53:01,342
<i>If we're going to show Lord Seventh
how strong we are,</i>

1746
01:53:01,367 --> 01:53:03,703
<i>we have to make it through
this second round.</i>

1747
01:53:05,346 --> 01:53:08,183
I don't need you to remind me!

1748
01:53:10,518 --> 01:53:11,895
Your surprise attack didn't work.

1749
01:53:13,480 --> 01:53:14,814
It's five against three.

1750
01:53:14,856 --> 01:53:17,108
You know who has
the advantage, don't you?

1751
01:53:27,577 --> 01:53:29,537
Who has the advantage now?

1752
01:53:32,499 --> 01:53:34,334
<i>Sarada! Go!</i>

1753
01:53:35,454 --> 01:53:36,685
I'll rejoin you soon!

1754
01:53:57,649 --> 01:53:58,608
<i>Boruto!</i>

1755
01:54:11,621 --> 01:54:14,874
There's no water around, but he can
use a Water Style this powerful?

1756
01:54:30,062 --> 01:54:31,772
He even knows...

1757
01:54:32,009 --> 01:54:33,510
Lightning Style?

1758
01:54:36,980 --> 01:54:38,273
I'm okay now.

1759
01:54:38,898 --> 01:54:41,067
Sarada! Go for the flag!

1760
01:54:41,276 --> 01:54:42,694
That's what I'm doing...

1761
01:54:55,707 --> 01:54:56,958
We did it!

1762
01:55:01,296 --> 01:55:02,797
I guess we managed somehow...

1763
01:55:03,214 --> 01:55:05,341
Yeah... It was a piece of cake.

1764
01:55:05,884 --> 01:55:07,468
As expected, Boruto...

1765
01:55:07,729 --> 01:55:10,427
You're a shinobi who's going
to be the Hokage one day.

1766
01:55:10,452 --> 01:55:12,288
<i>Excuse me!
But that's going to be me!</i>

1767
01:55:24,611 --> 01:55:25,695
He's good.

1768
01:55:26,571 --> 01:55:28,156
I couldn't even see him
weaving signs.

1769
01:55:28,573 --> 01:55:30,992
Leave it to the son
of Lord Seventh...

1770
01:55:31,826 --> 01:55:33,494
Okay, that makes four teams.

1771
01:55:34,078 --> 01:55:35,038
This round is over.

1772
01:55:35,355 --> 01:55:37,107
Thanks, Shino.
You've been a big help.

1773
01:55:37,290 --> 01:55:38,583
He got through the second round too.

1774
01:55:39,334 --> 01:55:41,169
It seems he used it
this time around.

1775
01:55:41,336 --> 01:55:44,088
<i>I see... Did you get footage of it?</i>

1776
01:55:44,172 --> 01:55:45,048
Yes.

1777
01:55:46,716 --> 01:55:48,176
Next up is the third test!

1778
01:55:48,676 --> 01:55:49,510
Yeah...

1779
01:55:51,387 --> 01:55:52,472
Boruto!

1780
01:55:52,597 --> 01:55:54,724
This means... finally...

1781
01:55:54,807 --> 01:55:57,810
Lord Seventh will get to witness
how strong we are!

1782
01:55:57,852 --> 01:55:59,687
Can't you be a little more excited?

1783
01:55:59,854 --> 01:56:01,481
I-I know!

1784
01:56:06,653 --> 01:56:07,695
I knew it.

1785
01:56:08,404 --> 01:56:11,824
Your eyes are bluer than
the Seventh's...

1786
01:56:14,164 --> 01:56:14,957
Really?

1787
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:18,545
They are! I'm sure of it!

1788
01:56:19,666 --> 01:56:20,833
You pay close attention, don't you?

1789
01:56:20,858 --> 01:56:22,610
Ask him to show you next time.

1790
01:56:22,669 --> 01:56:25,922
Lord Seventh is nice,
so he won't say no.

1791
01:56:38,977 --> 01:56:40,311
Uh, yes?

1792
01:56:45,525 --> 01:56:46,734
I'm impressed.

1793
01:56:47,443 --> 01:56:48,403
About what?

1794
01:56:48,444 --> 01:56:50,655
Boruto's team, of course.

1795
01:56:50,697 --> 01:56:52,156
They got through Round Two.

1796
01:56:53,032 --> 01:56:54,117
Th-They did, huh?

1797
01:56:55,076 --> 01:56:56,035
Well, see you.

1798
01:56:57,249 --> 01:56:59,126
You came all the way here
just to tell me that?

1799
01:57:00,373 --> 01:57:02,250
Well, it is important news.

1800
01:57:03,126 --> 01:57:06,004
By the way, Shikadai's team
made it too.

1801
01:57:06,421 --> 01:57:09,090
We just might see a battle
between our sons!

1802
01:57:16,764 --> 01:57:17,849
I'm home.

1803
01:57:18,570 --> 01:57:20,056
Welcome home!

1804
01:57:21,686 --> 01:57:23,229
Congratulations, Big Brother!

1805
01:57:24,522 --> 01:57:27,442
I just passed Round Two.
It's no big deal, you know!

1806
01:57:27,734 --> 01:57:28,943
Are you hurt?

1807
01:57:29,027 --> 01:57:30,486
I'm fine.

1808
01:57:30,903 --> 01:57:34,073
But I'm tired, so I'm just
going up to my room.

1809
01:57:36,367 --> 01:57:37,702
I don't need any dinner, either.

1810
01:57:46,753 --> 01:57:48,296
Sorry you made a wasted trip.

1811
01:57:48,702 --> 01:57:51,246
I've ordered a rush on
deciphering the scroll,

1812
01:57:51,382 --> 01:57:53,426
but it seems they need more time.

1813
01:57:54,017 --> 01:57:55,853
I see... I'll come back later.

1814
01:57:57,597 --> 01:57:58,556
Sasuke...

1815
01:57:59,459 --> 01:58:02,170
I understand you're training Boruto.

1816
01:58:05,039 --> 01:58:06,666
Did Boruto tell you?

1817
01:58:07,322 --> 01:58:09,741
No, I heard it from Konohamaru.

1818
01:58:11,773 --> 01:58:12,691
I see...

1819
01:58:15,125 --> 01:58:17,670
He came to me and asked
to be my student.

1820
01:58:18,859 --> 01:58:22,071
So you're... his teacher.

1821
01:58:24,947 --> 01:58:27,408
Maybe you were right, after all.

1822
01:58:27,962 --> 01:58:30,339
The soul of a shinobi
never changes...

1823
01:58:32,401 --> 01:58:35,112
even if the world changes.

1824
01:58:38,055 --> 01:58:40,599
That's what I believe.

1825
01:58:41,742 --> 01:58:43,744
Sarada passed too.

1826
01:58:45,456 --> 01:58:46,707
And, so?

1827
01:58:47,511 --> 01:58:50,013
At least look a little happy.

1828
01:58:51,176 --> 01:58:53,220
I knew from the start
that she would,

1829
01:58:53,344 --> 01:58:54,721
so what's there to celebrate?

1830
01:59:16,533 --> 01:59:18,535
<i>This thing really is amazing!</i>

1831
01:59:19,301 --> 01:59:20,720
<i>As long as I have this...</i>

1832
01:59:25,268 --> 01:59:28,062
H-Hey, I said I don't need dinner.

1833
01:59:30,439 --> 01:59:31,482
What is it?

1834
01:59:36,737 --> 01:59:38,114
D-Dad!

1835
01:59:43,369 --> 01:59:44,537
I...

1836
01:59:45,347 --> 01:59:47,766
I heard you passed
the Second Round.

1837
01:59:48,124 --> 01:59:49,542
Y-Yeah.

1838
01:59:51,961 --> 01:59:54,172
I... um...

1839
02:00:00,303 --> 02:00:01,262
What is it?

1840
02:00:11,105 --> 02:00:13,191
If that's all, can you go?

1841
02:00:16,777 --> 02:00:17,528
You...

1842
02:00:23,659 --> 02:00:25,244
You did well.

1843
02:00:31,125 --> 02:00:32,001
Well, see you later.

1844
02:00:32,752 --> 02:00:34,212
You came up just to say that?

1845
02:00:35,755 --> 02:00:37,965
Well, it's important.

1846
02:00:41,010 --> 02:00:43,721
It's very important.

1847
02:00:46,390 --> 02:00:47,934
Oh, one more thing...

1848
02:00:48,309 --> 02:00:49,393
Wh-What?

1849
02:00:52,321 --> 02:00:54,031
Don't lose to Shikadai!

1850
02:01:03,449 --> 02:01:05,034
L-Like I'd lose!

1851
02:01:09,872 --> 02:01:11,165
I'll be watching.

1852
02:01:13,709 --> 02:01:14,710
See you later.

1853
02:01:22,051 --> 02:01:24,428
If that's all he had to say,
he could've just emailed.

1854
02:01:39,788 --> 02:01:40,747
Stupid old man.

1855
02:02:06,053 --> 02:02:08,472
Mitsuki, when are you up?

1856
02:02:09,140 --> 02:02:10,141
I think I'm up fifth...

1857
02:02:10,641 --> 02:02:12,810
I couldn't eat breakfast
this morning.

1858
02:02:13,102 --> 02:02:14,645
I know what you mean!

1859
02:02:14,812 --> 02:02:16,397
Yet you sure can eat, Chubs.

1860
02:02:16,439 --> 02:02:19,483
What? No way!
I didn't realize I was eating!

1861
02:02:39,211 --> 02:02:42,256
All right... Everyone's an enemy
from here on out!

1862
02:02:44,342 --> 02:02:45,134
Seems like it.

1863
02:02:45,968 --> 02:02:48,346
You guys, don't lose until you
get far because I want to fight you!

1864
02:02:48,521 --> 02:02:49,856
That goes without saying!

1865
02:02:50,973 --> 02:02:54,435
It seems like we won't be
defeating anyone easily.

1866
02:02:54,935 --> 02:02:57,146
Let's show them
the Leaf's true strength!

1867
02:02:57,313 --> 02:02:57,897
Uh-huh.

1868
02:02:58,105 --> 02:02:59,398
Because the winner will be...

1869
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:00,483
– Me!
– Me!

1870
02:03:04,403 --> 02:03:05,363
Ya know!

1871
02:03:24,799 --> 02:03:27,134
Round Three consists of
individual matches!

1872
02:03:27,510 --> 02:03:29,345
To be held tournament style.

1873
02:03:29,809 --> 02:03:33,938
We purposely did not pit teammates
against each other in the first round...

1874
02:03:34,404 --> 02:03:37,159
However, if you win,
you may end up facing each other.

1875
02:03:37,937 --> 02:03:41,107
Please make sure you verify
what number your match is.

1876
02:03:42,149 --> 02:03:44,235
There will be three stages.

1877
02:03:44,485 --> 02:03:47,405
The three winners in
Blocks A, B, and C

1878
02:03:47,488 --> 02:03:52,535
will square off in the final match.

1879
02:04:00,251 --> 02:04:02,753
Are you ready?

1880
02:04:03,170 --> 02:04:03,921
Yeah!

1881
02:04:24,348 --> 02:04:26,641
Boruto Uzumaki of
the Hidden Leaf...

1882
02:04:27,653 --> 02:04:29,405
versus Yurui of
the Hidden Cloud!

1883
02:04:30,156 --> 02:04:32,700
Match One! Begin!

1884
02:04:40,059 --> 02:04:42,811
I'm gonna "take" you, Boruto.

1885
02:04:42,873 --> 02:04:43,582
Huh?

1886
02:04:44,336 --> 02:04:45,463
"Take"?

1887
02:04:45,713 --> 02:04:47,965
It means I'm gonna take you down
in one fell swoop!

1888
02:04:48,577 --> 02:04:49,786
That's so lame.

1889
02:04:49,925 --> 02:04:51,760
Quit shortening everything!

1890
02:04:52,803 --> 02:04:55,473
Maybe I'll just shorten
this match too!

1891
02:04:58,182 --> 02:04:59,433
Like I'm going to get myself caught.

1892
02:05:07,318 --> 02:05:08,777
It explodes?

1893
02:05:15,075 --> 02:05:15,659
Heh.

1894
02:05:20,305 --> 02:05:23,434
Shinki, you were looking forward to
a match with Boruto...

1895
02:05:23,626 --> 02:05:25,336
It might not happen.

1896
02:05:25,689 --> 02:05:27,649
I'm not interested in
anyone who's weak.

1897
02:05:28,606 --> 02:05:30,358
You guys better watch out
for the remaining two...

1898
02:05:30,383 --> 02:05:32,427
Especially Mitsuki.

1899
02:05:33,427 --> 02:05:35,596
Heh, I don't need your advice.

1900
02:05:36,138 --> 02:05:40,184
I'll just crush Mitsuki in my match.

1901
02:05:40,726 --> 02:05:44,605
The caliber of students
taking the exam... is sad.

1902
02:05:52,175 --> 02:05:54,094
Sneaking around and
playing hide-and-seek?!

1903
02:05:57,368 --> 02:05:59,745
Damn it! That gum is in the way!

1904
02:06:00,663 --> 02:06:03,499
All right, guess it's time
to grind this...

1905
02:06:16,303 --> 02:06:20,015
So that's the gum that uses
chakra as a catalyst?

1906
02:06:20,641 --> 02:06:22,643
Isn't it pretty interesting?

1907
02:06:23,365 --> 02:06:24,699
Damn it!

1908
02:06:29,299 --> 02:06:31,259
I ain't losing here!

1909
02:06:54,091 --> 02:06:56,093
<i>It won't reach me
all the way here.</i>

1910
02:07:03,006 --> 02:07:04,674
<i>No... way...</i>

1911
02:07:13,214 --> 02:07:15,341
Hey, was that for real?

1912
02:07:16,363 --> 02:07:17,239
Amazing...

1913
02:07:17,781 --> 02:07:20,117
How can he bend it that much?

1914
02:07:24,788 --> 02:07:25,623
Sorry...

1915
02:07:25,792 --> 02:07:27,710
Looks like I took you down!

1916
02:07:28,156 --> 02:07:30,492
What was your name? Charai?

1917
02:07:30,723 --> 02:07:32,385
It's Yurui.

1918
02:07:33,437 --> 02:07:36,314
The winner is Boruto Uzumaki
of the Hidden Leaf!

1919
02:07:37,394 --> 02:07:38,812
He won! He won!

1920
02:07:39,488 --> 02:07:41,573
That kid's pretty good.

1921
02:07:48,145 --> 02:07:50,189
Damn it, that makes me angry!

1922
02:07:50,731 --> 02:07:52,775
Who would have expected
that both of our teams

1923
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:54,427
would be eliminated before
the finals?

1924
02:07:55,029 --> 02:07:55,780
It's fine.

1925
02:07:56,155 --> 02:07:59,492
Essentially, the Leaf just wanted to
enter their prized offspring...

1926
02:07:59,550 --> 02:08:03,538
and let them become chunin,
so it can't be helped.

1927
02:08:03,869 --> 02:08:05,663
They can win simply by entering?

1928
02:08:05,954 --> 02:08:08,248
Doting parents are annoying,
Mizukage.

1929
02:08:09,056 --> 02:08:10,641
I shall take that to heart.

1930
02:08:13,128 --> 02:08:14,213
Pretty good!

1931
02:08:15,502 --> 02:08:17,838
When did you practicing that?

1932
02:08:18,467 --> 02:08:20,511
Yeah, well... It was a breeze!

1933
02:08:25,766 --> 02:08:26,767
Which match is up?

1934
02:08:26,767 --> 02:08:27,559
Hmm, let's see...

1935
02:08:27,768 --> 02:08:31,146
Doesn't this bring back memories
of our Chunin Exams?

1936
02:08:31,563 --> 02:08:34,608
That was the first time
we met you, Temari.

1937
02:08:34,882 --> 02:08:35,842
That's right!

1938
02:08:35,983 --> 02:08:37,609
You had such a bad attitude
back then.

1939
02:08:38,070 --> 02:08:39,113
I don't remember.

1940
02:08:39,363 --> 02:08:40,364
Let me correct myself.

1941
02:08:40,573 --> 02:08:42,242
You still have a bad attitude.

1942
02:08:44,366 --> 02:08:46,743
Shikadai's opponent is from
the Hidden Sand?

1943
02:08:47,413 --> 02:08:49,081
That's your birthplace,
right, Temari?

1944
02:08:49,540 --> 02:08:51,291
You must have mixed feelings.

1945
02:08:52,005 --> 02:08:55,399
Shikadai! If you lose,
it's game over!

1946
02:08:55,671 --> 02:08:57,089
Go for it!

1947
02:08:58,966 --> 02:09:01,760
Don't turn it into a bad match,
Shikadai...

1948
02:09:02,136 --> 02:09:04,430
Anyway, please go easy on me.

1949
02:09:11,019 --> 02:09:12,229
Match two!

1950
02:09:12,484 --> 02:09:16,280
Shikadai Nara of the Hidden Leaf
versus Yodo of the Hidden Sand!

1951
02:09:17,025 --> 02:09:17,735
Begin!

1952
02:09:21,071 --> 02:09:21,989
Stand ready!

1953
02:09:22,406 --> 02:09:24,116
Don't look down on me!

1954
02:09:27,494 --> 02:09:29,538
Damn it. You have such
a bad attitude.

1955
02:09:30,706 --> 02:09:32,791
Fine. It's going to be a drag,
but I'll attack first!

1956
02:09:37,546 --> 02:09:38,756
Like I'd let you get away!

1957
02:09:49,401 --> 02:09:51,820
C'mon, what are you doing?!

1958
02:09:52,686 --> 02:09:55,856
We're always the ones who create
an opening with a diversion...

1959
02:09:56,945 --> 02:09:59,280
At least now,
he can appreciate what we do.

1960
02:09:59,751 --> 02:10:03,629
Yeah, see what happens when
you slack off during taijutsu practice?

1961
02:10:05,032 --> 02:10:06,700
Still, that one...

1962
02:10:06,867 --> 02:10:08,660
She has sharp eyes.

1963
02:10:09,036 --> 02:10:11,663
To be able to dodge an attack
like that so easily.

1964
02:10:12,247 --> 02:10:15,042
Yeah... There's something about her.

1965
02:10:15,460 --> 02:10:16,419
Like what?

1966
02:10:16,627 --> 02:10:17,586
Just watch...

1967
02:10:17,586 --> 02:10:19,421
I think Shikadai's going to test
something out next.

1968
02:10:21,757 --> 02:10:23,801
<i>Damn it.
Acting so calm and cool.</i>

1969
02:10:24,176 --> 02:10:24,968
<i>Well then...</i>

1970
02:10:29,223 --> 02:10:30,349
<i>How about this?</i>

1971
02:10:31,767 --> 02:10:32,476
<i>What?!</i>

1972
02:10:45,364 --> 02:10:46,532
That didn't work either, huh?

1973
02:10:47,115 --> 02:10:48,283
Watch it, Shikadai!

1974
02:10:48,440 --> 02:10:49,627
Aim properly!

1975
02:10:58,293 --> 02:10:59,545
That Yodo...

1976
02:10:59,962 --> 02:11:01,630
Can she read shadows?

1977
02:11:01,876 --> 02:11:04,545
Shikadai, don't waste your chakra!

1978
02:11:07,010 --> 02:11:08,470
She's moving around so much.

1979
02:11:09,429 --> 02:11:10,681
Are you done?

1980
02:11:11,181 --> 02:11:12,933
All right, it's my turn.

1981
02:11:18,438 --> 02:11:19,815
This is where it gets serious...

1982
02:11:20,858 --> 02:11:22,150
Here I go.

1983
02:11:32,035 --> 02:11:34,121
What was that attack just now?

1984
02:11:34,921 --> 02:11:37,006
Was it Wind Style? Or not?

1985
02:11:37,207 --> 02:11:38,125
One more time!

1986
02:11:46,008 --> 02:11:47,634
Those are high frequencies, huh?

1987
02:11:48,135 --> 02:11:49,845
If that hits me, I'm out.

1988
02:11:52,306 --> 02:11:53,140
But...

1989
02:11:53,140 --> 02:11:55,642
I can't afford to lose this early on
in the game!

1990
02:12:03,567 --> 02:12:05,694
Oh! That was so close!

1991
02:12:06,445 --> 02:12:09,823
<i>Why? Just now, her reaction
was slightly delayed.</i>

1992
02:12:16,741 --> 02:12:18,952
Gum? Gross!

1993
02:12:19,917 --> 02:12:20,834
Damn it...

1994
02:12:23,703 --> 02:12:24,996
<i>Damn that guy!</i>

1995
02:12:27,716 --> 02:12:28,675
I get it!

1996
02:12:32,050 --> 02:12:34,135
It's sound... right?

1997
02:12:34,943 --> 02:12:37,947
At first, I thought you had sharp eyes.

1998
02:12:38,275 --> 02:12:39,777
But in that smoke bomb...

1999
02:12:39,978 --> 02:12:41,229
and that feint...

2000
02:12:41,313 --> 02:12:42,731
You countered easily.

2001
02:12:43,591 --> 02:12:46,974
Which means you weren't relying
on your eyes.

2002
02:12:48,070 --> 02:12:52,642
When you took your hood off, your
earphones were gone, so it crossed my mind...

2003
02:12:53,450 --> 02:12:55,661
but who would've imagined
that you could hear

2004
02:12:55,702 --> 02:12:57,746
the slight sound of me shifting
my weight

2005
02:12:57,771 --> 02:13:00,024
as I turned to control my shadow!

2006
02:13:00,832 --> 02:13:03,585
That explains why your reaction
was a beat delayed

2007
02:13:03,610 --> 02:13:05,904
when I stepped on the gum earlier.

2008
02:13:07,016 --> 02:13:09,226
Your hearing is frighteningly good.

2009
02:13:10,175 --> 02:13:12,427
Perhaps I should commend you
for taking notice...

2010
02:13:13,136 --> 02:13:15,088
But shifting one's weight is
a subconscious habit...

2011
02:13:16,139 --> 02:13:18,934
Realizing it doesn't mean
you can control it.

2012
02:13:19,935 --> 02:13:23,480
You use headphones to keep your
sensitive ears in check, don't you?

2013
02:13:24,064 --> 02:13:24,898
Are you nervous?

2014
02:13:25,232 --> 02:13:25,941
Huh?

2015
02:13:26,415 --> 02:13:29,835
Your quickening heartbeat...
shallow breathing...

2016
02:13:30,278 --> 02:13:32,072
It's so obvious.

2017
02:13:32,406 --> 02:13:33,740
So what?!

2018
02:13:35,242 --> 02:13:37,119
Don't let her manipulate you!

2019
02:13:39,663 --> 02:13:40,330
Too late!

2020
02:13:50,465 --> 02:13:51,466
Shikadai!

2021
02:13:52,259 --> 02:13:56,013
I thought, since you were Lady
Temari's son, you'd have some skill.

2022
02:13:56,430 --> 02:13:58,390
But the Hidden Sand
is the best—

2023
02:13:58,415 --> 02:13:59,833
You see, when you say stuff
like that,

2024
02:14:00,826 --> 02:14:02,661
you're slinging mud at my mom,

2025
02:14:02,686 --> 02:14:04,771
who's now a citizen of
the Hidden Leaf.

2026
02:14:11,069 --> 02:14:14,031
You... deliberately set off
a paper bomb—!

2027
02:14:14,573 --> 02:14:18,118
There was no other way to muffle
the sound of my shoes...

2028
02:14:23,540 --> 02:14:25,333
Shall we call it a match?

2029
02:14:26,626 --> 02:14:27,544
I give up...

2030
02:14:30,288 --> 02:14:32,248
The winner... Shikadai Nara!

2031
02:14:32,966 --> 02:14:34,301
Yeah!

2032
02:14:34,760 --> 02:14:35,552
All right!

2033
02:14:47,064 --> 02:14:48,940
Uh, pardon me!

2034
02:14:56,441 --> 02:14:57,827
She gave you a hard time.

2035
02:14:58,283 --> 02:14:59,367
So what?

2036
02:15:00,035 --> 02:15:02,287
Sarada... Go all out.

2037
02:15:03,538 --> 02:15:04,206
Three seconds...

2038
02:15:06,625 --> 02:15:07,334
Watch me.

2039
02:15:08,585 --> 02:15:09,211
Huh?

2040
02:15:10,796 --> 02:15:14,382
I hear you've been dreaming
about becoming the Hokage?

2041
02:15:15,092 --> 02:15:17,511
Well, let me give you
a glimpse of reality...

2042
02:15:20,703 --> 02:15:21,746
Match Three!

2043
02:15:22,516 --> 02:15:25,519
Sarada Uchiha of
the Hidden Leaf

2044
02:15:25,852 --> 02:15:27,479
versus Tarui of
the Hidden Rock!

2045
02:15:28,031 --> 02:15:28,656
Begin!

2046
02:15:34,611 --> 02:15:35,195
<i>One!</i>

2047
02:15:36,983 --> 02:15:37,692
<i>Two!</i>

2048
02:15:39,157 --> 02:15:39,825
<i>Three!</i>

2049
02:15:45,598 --> 02:15:47,392
The winner... Sarada Uchiha!

2050
02:15:48,208 --> 02:15:50,460
– Cha!
– Cha!

2051
02:15:52,546 --> 02:15:53,630
Amazing!

2052
02:15:53,839 --> 02:15:56,299
All right...
We got three straight wins.

2053
02:15:56,800 --> 02:15:57,634
Piece of cake!

2054
02:15:58,009 --> 02:15:59,803
Good thing your opponent
was weak.

2055
02:16:01,388 --> 02:16:04,523
Look, she wasn't weak.

2056
02:16:04,724 --> 02:16:06,309
I was just strong!

2057
02:16:15,668 --> 02:16:18,379
Okay, I guess I'll make it
four in a row.

2058
02:16:20,157 --> 02:16:21,408
Match Four!

2059
02:16:21,947 --> 02:16:25,370
Inojin Yamanaka versus Araya
of the Hidden Sand!

2060
02:16:25,787 --> 02:16:28,432
Inojin, stay focused!

2061
02:16:36,381 --> 02:16:38,633
Oh... That's a long weapon
you have there.

2062
02:16:39,843 --> 02:16:41,136
This is my weapon.

2063
02:16:42,012 --> 02:16:44,222
Like they say, the pen is mightier
than the sword.

2064
02:16:48,143 --> 02:16:49,894
You think that makes you
look cool?

2065
02:16:51,043 --> 02:16:53,337
Well, I'll pull that pretentious mask
off your face.

2066
02:16:57,110 --> 02:16:58,904
<i>Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll!</i>

2067
02:17:15,629 --> 02:17:16,379
How's that?

2068
02:17:17,505 --> 02:17:19,382
Those were specially made with
paper bombs planted inside!

2069
02:17:25,180 --> 02:17:27,057
No reaction to the explosions?

2070
02:17:31,728 --> 02:17:32,479
No way!

2071
02:17:36,485 --> 02:17:38,904
The winner is Araya
of the Hidden Sand!

2072
02:17:47,202 --> 02:17:48,036
You were close.

2073
02:17:58,380 --> 02:18:02,008
This is my Lightning Style:
Overdrive!

2074
02:18:02,801 --> 02:18:06,012
Electrical signals sent from the brain
are what make muscles move.

2075
02:18:06,471 --> 02:18:10,517
I'm able to speed up those signals
with Lightning Style, y'see?

2076
02:18:23,506 --> 02:18:25,300
Wh-What's that?

2077
02:18:29,452 --> 02:18:30,203
This is...

2078
02:18:36,042 --> 02:18:38,753
<i>Oops... I'm not supposed
to use this.</i>

2079
02:18:40,505 --> 02:18:41,673
Show me what's up next.

2080
02:18:42,507 --> 02:18:44,301
What was that just now?!

2081
02:18:46,094 --> 02:18:47,679
You trying to scare me?!

2082
02:18:49,889 --> 02:18:50,974
Snakes?!

2083
02:18:57,147 --> 02:18:59,441
I... give... up!

2084
02:19:00,817 --> 02:19:03,486
The winner...
Mitsuki of the Hidden Leaf!

2085
02:19:09,492 --> 02:19:11,677
Okay, I'm loaded up with calories.

2086
02:19:12,662 --> 02:19:13,705
Nice!

2087
02:19:14,289 --> 02:19:16,499
Okay, I'll do this nice and easy.

2088
02:19:16,958 --> 02:19:18,460
Do you best, Cho-Cho!

2089
02:19:18,629 --> 02:19:19,546
Of course!

2090
02:19:23,131 --> 02:19:23,631
Hand!

2091
02:19:23,965 --> 02:19:24,382
Huh?

2092
02:19:24,758 --> 02:19:26,134
Give me your hand!

2093
02:19:26,676 --> 02:19:27,427
Yay!

2094
02:19:29,554 --> 02:19:31,014
Do your best, Chubs!

2095
02:19:31,473 --> 02:19:33,516
Chubs is off!

2096
02:19:35,602 --> 02:19:36,936
So, Cho-Cho's the last one.

2097
02:19:42,901 --> 02:19:45,612
It's the last match of
the first elimination round.

2098
02:19:46,321 --> 02:19:48,615
That boy's the ace from
your village, isn't he, Gaara?

2099
02:19:49,032 --> 02:19:49,699
Is he strong?

2100
02:19:50,533 --> 02:19:51,785
You'll soon see.

2101
02:19:57,274 --> 02:19:59,985
Would you happen to be
one of those shy boys?

2102
02:20:00,377 --> 02:20:03,213
Did you turn away because
you're so enthralled by my charm?

2103
02:20:04,141 --> 02:20:05,475
I should apologize in advance.

2104
02:20:05,965 --> 02:20:07,801
Wh-What does that mean?

2105
02:20:08,802 --> 02:20:11,596
I'm not good...
at holding back...

2106
02:20:18,728 --> 02:20:21,231
The final match of
the first round!

2107
02:20:21,811 --> 02:20:24,439
Cho-Cho Akimichi of
the Hidden Leaf versus

2108
02:20:24,801 --> 02:20:26,803
Shinki of the Hidden Sand...

2109
02:20:27,445 --> 02:20:28,738
Go for it, Cho-Cho!

2110
02:20:28,905 --> 02:20:30,615
Make sure you finish strong!

2111
02:20:31,006 --> 02:20:31,966
Don't you dare do
anything careless—

2112
02:20:31,991 --> 02:20:34,744
L-O-V-E!

2113
02:20:34,869 --> 02:20:37,288
Fight, Cho-Cho!

2114
02:20:38,070 --> 02:20:41,282
If you win, you can eat all
the Thunder burgers you want!

2115
02:20:41,477 --> 02:20:46,523
All-you-can-eat burgers with Dad!
Of course, Mom too!

2116
02:20:47,715 --> 02:20:49,467
Burgers, huh?

2117
02:20:49,880 --> 02:20:51,718
That's not very exciting...

2118
02:20:52,151 --> 02:20:53,986
The match has already started!

2119
02:20:54,389 --> 02:20:55,640
What are you waiting for?
Stand ready!

2120
02:20:55,762 --> 02:20:56,424
Huh?

2121
02:20:56,749 --> 02:20:58,250
Oh, okay!

2122
02:20:59,322 --> 02:21:01,824
Your parents are quite funny...

2123
02:21:03,648 --> 02:21:05,316
I feel kind of bad

2124
02:21:05,486 --> 02:21:09,990
they'll be witnessing
their daughter's miserable defeat.

2125
02:21:10,238 --> 02:21:13,408
Huh? Just who do you think you are?

2126
02:21:14,826 --> 02:21:16,286
You'll soon find out.

2127
02:21:19,330 --> 02:21:22,500
Just how skilled is
Cho-Cho anyway?

2128
02:21:22,792 --> 02:21:24,627
She's got great talent.

2129
02:21:25,102 --> 02:21:27,604
It's just that
she lacks motivation...

2130
02:21:32,927 --> 02:21:34,304
Hurry and attack.

2131
02:21:35,280 --> 02:21:38,391
Neither you nor those guys from
Round Two are suited to be shinobi.

2132
02:21:39,058 --> 02:21:42,395
I'll show you what reality's like.

2133
02:21:42,604 --> 02:21:43,563
Huh?

2134
02:21:44,149 --> 02:21:46,151
You just ticked me off!

2135
02:21:46,524 --> 02:21:48,443
<i>Partial Expansion Jutsu!</i>

2136
02:21:51,212 --> 02:21:52,714
Brute strength right
from the start?

2137
02:21:52,739 --> 02:21:53,740
Not refined at all.

2138
02:21:53,781 --> 02:21:56,034
The way you look down
on people...

2139
02:21:56,034 --> 02:21:58,411
makes me really mad!

2140
02:22:19,541 --> 02:22:21,960
What is that jutsu?

2141
02:22:22,393 --> 02:22:25,605
That's the one Metal and the others
were helpless against, right?

2142
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:27,690
Look down on people?

2143
02:22:28,215 --> 02:22:30,384
Well, I don't think
you're wrong about that.

2144
02:22:40,411 --> 02:22:42,372
Will she be okay... Mama?

2145
02:22:42,566 --> 02:22:44,739
What's the point of you
getting scared?

2146
02:22:44,888 --> 02:22:46,723
Cho-Cho is no idiot.

2147
02:22:46,793 --> 02:22:49,379
If close combat doesn't work,
she'll switch to long-distance tactics.

2148
02:22:49,629 --> 02:22:50,755
You're right!

2149
02:22:51,130 --> 02:22:52,423
Distance! Distance!

2150
02:22:52,642 --> 02:22:54,268
Move away from him!

2151
02:22:56,594 --> 02:23:00,932
You should be grateful that you have
parents who are concerned about you.

2152
02:23:00,974 --> 02:23:02,100
Excuse me?

2153
02:23:02,141 --> 02:23:05,019
I don't understand
what you're getting at.

2154
02:23:09,148 --> 02:23:11,192
Hurry up and give up.

2155
02:23:13,194 --> 02:23:15,863
I told you,
I'm not good at holding back...

2156
02:23:22,203 --> 02:23:23,788
Ouch!

2157
02:23:23,871 --> 02:23:26,165
I just had my nails done too.

2158
02:23:26,249 --> 02:23:27,584
How are you going
to make it up to me?

2159
02:23:27,834 --> 02:23:31,004
If you're toying with me,
you'll pay big time.

2160
02:23:34,424 --> 02:23:37,302
Cho-Cho's eyes
suddenly got intense.

2161
02:23:37,594 --> 02:23:38,469
Yes.

2162
02:23:38,511 --> 02:23:41,014
Don't try to sneak up close to him!

2163
02:23:45,212 --> 02:23:46,861
<i>Partial Expansion Jutsu!</i>

2164
02:23:47,829 --> 02:23:49,831
The same tactic won't work!

2165
02:23:55,989 --> 02:23:57,950
<i>Hollow...</i>

2166
02:23:58,318 --> 02:23:59,444
<i>Boom!</i>

2167
02:24:03,094 --> 02:24:04,178
I knew it!

2168
02:24:04,276 --> 02:24:07,196
You infused chakra into
the Iron Sand to manipulate it.

2169
02:24:07,665 --> 02:24:11,419
Knowing that doesn't change
the situation.

2170
02:24:13,656 --> 02:24:15,590
Your boy is pretty skilled.

2171
02:24:15,840 --> 02:24:17,342
Where'd you find him?

2172
02:24:20,762 --> 02:24:22,013
He was...

2173
02:25:19,404 --> 02:25:22,365
<i>I'll teach you
how to use your power.</i>

2174
02:25:23,408 --> 02:25:24,450
<i>What's your name?</i>

2175
02:25:27,495 --> 02:25:28,629
<i>Shinki...</i>

2176
02:26:03,865 --> 02:26:07,034
That's right... Show me more
of your desperation.

2177
02:26:07,160 --> 02:26:10,621
Wh-Why you!

2178
02:26:30,433 --> 02:26:33,102
Cho-Cho...
You don't have to get up.

2179
02:26:33,144 --> 02:26:34,771
You've done more than enough!

2180
02:26:41,861 --> 02:26:44,071
You know it's hopeless,
but you still stand?

2181
02:26:46,449 --> 02:26:49,744
You know, in the rare edition
series of potato chips,

2182
02:26:50,912 --> 02:26:55,458
there's a spicy
codfish roe-flavored one.

2183
02:26:56,834 --> 02:26:59,796
That can't possibly
taste good, right?

2184
02:27:00,457 --> 02:27:05,128
But, I'll still try it.

2185
02:27:06,219 --> 02:27:09,765
Sink or swim,
I have to taste them.

2186
02:27:10,598 --> 02:27:12,183
Otherwise, you'll never know
until you try it, right?

2187
02:27:14,560 --> 02:27:15,853
That sign!

2188
02:27:16,020 --> 02:27:18,689
Dear, she can't do that one yet!

2189
02:27:18,892 --> 02:27:20,685
That's not true...

2190
02:27:21,359 --> 02:27:22,652
It's just that...

2191
02:27:23,091 --> 02:27:25,677
She really hates using it.

2192
02:27:29,242 --> 02:27:33,162
With the chakra you have left,
nothing you do will work.

2193
02:27:36,014 --> 02:27:37,747
Like I said...

2194
02:27:38,775 --> 02:27:41,445
You never know until you try it!

2195
02:27:43,089 --> 02:27:44,465
Why are you going this far?

2196
02:27:45,456 --> 02:27:47,416
I really hate using this, but...

2197
02:27:48,667 --> 02:27:50,210
<i>Human Boulder!</i>

2198
02:28:17,790 --> 02:28:20,835
– Go—!
– Go, Cho-Cho!

2199
02:28:21,502 --> 02:28:24,964
<i>Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll!</i>

2200
02:28:34,098 --> 02:28:38,060
<i>Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll!</i>

2201
02:28:53,098 --> 02:28:54,224
Hey you...

2202
02:28:54,535 --> 02:28:57,663
Did your opinion of me change
a little at least?

2203
02:28:59,021 --> 02:29:00,105
Well...

2204
02:29:00,500 --> 02:29:03,086
Just that I was much better
than you, after all.

2205
02:29:04,149 --> 02:29:05,525
I see.

2206
02:29:05,921 --> 02:29:09,109
How frustrating!

2207
02:29:12,461 --> 02:29:14,764
The winner is Shinki
of the Hidden Sand!

2208
02:29:15,681 --> 02:29:16,807
He's strong...

2209
02:29:16,974 --> 02:29:19,810
Cho-Cho was using her true power.

2210
02:29:20,107 --> 02:29:21,150
And still....

2211
02:29:21,479 --> 02:29:23,397
She couldn't put a scratch on him.

2212
02:29:23,898 --> 02:29:25,650
It's a jutsu similar to
the Kazekage's,

2213
02:29:25,733 --> 02:29:28,361
but the properties and intensity
of his Iron Sand exceeds it.

2214
02:29:29,683 --> 02:29:30,684
<i>Damn it.</i>

2215
02:29:30,712 --> 02:29:33,298
<i>Boruto and the others don't
have a chance against him.</i>

2216
02:29:36,177 --> 02:29:37,178
Cho-Cho!

2217
02:29:37,203 --> 02:29:38,204
Get a hold of yourself!

2218
02:29:38,204 --> 02:29:39,789
Oh, she seems okay.

2219
02:29:40,247 --> 02:29:41,540
Since she's got a silly grin
on her face.

2220
02:29:41,707 --> 02:29:42,500
Huh?!

2221
02:29:44,293 --> 02:29:45,002
So heavy!

2222
02:29:45,327 --> 02:29:46,662
Your name's Mitsuki, right?

2223
02:29:47,668 --> 02:29:49,152
You'd better learn
from what you just saw.

2224
02:29:49,882 --> 02:29:50,841
What do you mean?

2225
02:29:51,437 --> 02:29:53,147
No matter what the reason,

2226
02:29:53,517 --> 02:29:56,228
to ease up on an opponent is
to show contempt towards him.

2227
02:29:56,931 --> 02:29:58,808
In the next match,

2228
02:29:59,135 --> 02:30:01,429
I shall bring you down,
on my father's honor.

2229
02:30:01,978 --> 02:30:04,730
You'll be sorry, if you try to pull
what you did in the first round.

2230
02:30:05,091 --> 02:30:07,018
On your father's honor, you say?

2231
02:30:07,247 --> 02:30:08,414
Don't make me laugh.

2232
02:30:08,780 --> 02:30:12,284
In a battle, you fight for yourself.

2233
02:30:13,847 --> 02:30:15,974
I'll defeat you in the match
after that.

2234
02:30:17,410 --> 02:30:19,203
That's if you're still in the running.

2235
02:30:19,370 --> 02:30:20,413
Fine with me.

2236
02:30:20,637 --> 02:30:23,848
But you should talk after
you beat Mitsuki!

2237
02:30:25,960 --> 02:30:26,794
Cho-Cho!

2238
02:30:28,379 --> 02:30:29,463
Cho-Cho...

2239
02:30:29,964 --> 02:30:31,799
She just used too much chakra.

2240
02:30:31,924 --> 02:30:33,342
I don't think there's anything
to worry about.

2241
02:30:33,634 --> 02:30:34,593
I see.

2242
02:30:34,844 --> 02:30:36,262
Thank you, Sarada.

2243
02:30:39,485 --> 02:30:41,487
Papa... Mama...

2244
02:30:42,018 --> 02:30:42,893
Cho-Cho!

2245
02:30:43,310 --> 02:30:45,354
What is it? Are you in pain?

2246
02:30:46,197 --> 02:30:47,240
That guy...

2247
02:30:48,441 --> 02:30:51,152
He's... pretty handsome, isn't he?

2248
02:30:52,570 --> 02:30:54,488
He's not bad at all.

2249
02:30:56,073 --> 02:30:58,325
Didn't I tell you there's
no need to worry?

2250
02:30:58,867 --> 02:31:00,994
Well, I won't allow it!

2251
02:31:01,019 --> 02:31:03,230
Papa's handsome too, okay?!

2252
02:31:06,893 --> 02:31:09,062
This marks the end of
the elimination matches.

2253
02:31:09,486 --> 02:31:11,029
The first match of
the semifinals will be

2254
02:31:11,088 --> 02:31:13,382
Boruto Uzumaki against
Shikadai Nara.

2255
02:31:13,758 --> 02:31:16,761
The match will begin after
a 30-minute break!

2256
02:31:17,970 --> 02:31:20,890
This has turned out to be a drag...

2257
02:31:21,682 --> 02:31:24,978
This is the first time we're
fighting all proper like this, huh?

2258
02:31:25,478 --> 02:31:29,065
I hear you can produce up to
four Shadow Clones?

2259
02:31:29,732 --> 02:31:30,733
Oh, what?

2260
02:31:30,900 --> 02:31:33,611
I was planning to shock you
during our match.

2261
02:31:34,403 --> 02:31:37,364
Let's do this fair and square
with no hard feelings, okay?

2262
02:31:39,241 --> 02:31:40,701
Don't cry after you lose.

2263
02:31:50,586 --> 02:31:53,547
<i>Let's do this fair and square
with no hard feelings, okay?</i>

2264
02:31:59,220 --> 02:32:02,264
Oh well, I don't need
this thing to win anyway.

2265
02:32:03,849 --> 02:32:06,143
You really didn't have
to take time to come.

2266
02:32:06,852 --> 02:32:08,938
What kind of remark is that?

2267
02:32:09,021 --> 02:32:10,314
So not cute.

2268
02:32:10,523 --> 02:32:12,858
Just don't get
your hopes up too high.

2269
02:32:13,192 --> 02:32:13,984
Seriously?

2270
02:32:14,485 --> 02:32:17,238
Do you have to be
so much like your dad?

2271
02:32:18,489 --> 02:32:20,950
Well, being able to relax
is a good thing.

2272
02:32:22,409 --> 02:32:25,079
Listen, you have just one chance.

2273
02:32:26,163 --> 02:32:26,789
Yeah...

2274
02:32:27,873 --> 02:32:28,916
I know.

2275
02:32:30,417 --> 02:32:32,294
I don't mean to
pressure you, but...

2276
02:32:33,003 --> 02:32:34,171
Don't lose to Boruto.

2277
02:32:34,505 --> 02:32:36,090
What's that supposed to mean?

2278
02:32:36,215 --> 02:32:37,716
That's putting pressure
on him, though...

2279
02:32:37,741 --> 02:32:40,244
Well, I didn't mean it to be.
Anyway, just win!

2280
02:32:40,269 --> 02:32:41,103
Yup, just win.

2281
02:32:41,128 --> 02:32:42,046
Just leave!

2282
02:32:48,561 --> 02:32:50,855
The semi-final match
will begin shortly.

2283
02:32:51,486 --> 02:32:54,030
All right...
I guess I'll go win a match.

2284
02:32:57,278 --> 02:32:58,612
You're late, Shikamaru.

2285
02:32:58,863 --> 02:33:00,406
Oh, sorry.

2286
02:33:01,115 --> 02:33:02,116
Where've you been?

2287
02:33:03,617 --> 02:33:04,451
Just out.

2288
02:33:08,205 --> 02:33:13,043
Boruto Uzumaki of the Leaf,
and Shikadai Nara of the Leaf!

2289
02:33:19,550 --> 02:33:21,177
Oh, it's Big Brother!

2290
02:33:31,061 --> 02:33:33,606
Match one of the semi-finals... Begin!

2291
02:33:36,078 --> 02:33:37,871
Do your best, Big Brother!

2292
02:33:50,706 --> 02:33:52,583
They've both improved so much!

2293
02:33:52,666 --> 02:33:54,919
It's too bad
this isn't the final match.

2294
02:33:58,255 --> 02:34:00,174
They're both doing great!

2295
02:34:00,382 --> 02:34:03,219
Well, Shikadai's serious
for a change.

2296
02:34:06,722 --> 02:34:08,182
<i>Wind Style: Gale Palm!</i>

2297
02:34:08,182 --> 02:34:08,682
Whoa!

2298
02:34:12,770 --> 02:34:13,812
That was dangerous.

2299
02:34:14,313 --> 02:34:18,275
I wanted to end this before
you used your Shadow Paralysis!

2300
02:34:19,568 --> 02:34:21,237
Don't get smart with me!

2301
02:34:29,245 --> 02:34:30,454
See?

2302
02:34:30,746 --> 02:34:33,123
Your Shadow Paralysis has
gotten much sharper!

2303
02:34:33,624 --> 02:34:35,793
Shut up, and let me catch you!

2304
02:34:38,712 --> 02:34:40,422
<i>Don't panic, Shikadai...</i>

2305
02:34:40,756 --> 02:34:42,800
<i>Show us the fruits
of your training.</i>

2306
02:34:43,717 --> 02:34:44,885
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

2307
02:34:45,761 --> 02:34:46,679
Hey little Shikadai...

2308
02:34:46,720 --> 02:34:47,888
Over here!

2309
02:34:47,913 --> 02:34:49,122
Over here!

2310
02:34:49,184 --> 02:34:50,310
Where are you looking?!

2311
02:34:50,335 --> 02:34:51,795
Hey, hey!
Over here! Over here!

2312
02:34:52,017 --> 02:34:53,686
Quit jumping around.

2313
02:34:54,019 --> 02:34:54,979
Over here! Over here!

2314
02:35:00,818 --> 02:35:01,986
<i>I got his back.</i>

2315
02:35:02,403 --> 02:35:04,989
<i>With the clones as my insurance,
I can do it now!</i>

2316
02:35:07,793 --> 02:35:08,627
Gotcha!

2317
02:35:17,376 --> 02:35:18,210
Yes!

2318
02:35:18,252 --> 02:35:20,462
H-Hey! What's that?

2319
02:35:20,546 --> 02:35:23,215
How can he spread
his shadow that far?!

2320
02:35:24,758 --> 02:35:27,803
It just means Boruto wasn't the only one
getting special training.

2321
02:35:30,514 --> 02:35:31,557
No way...

2322
02:35:34,601 --> 02:35:38,272
I already figured that
you'd resort to your Shadow Clones...

2323
02:35:38,647 --> 02:35:41,650
So, I practiced a counter-strategy
with my dad.

2324
02:35:44,153 --> 02:35:48,032
So anyway, I really wish
you'd give up graciously.

2325
02:35:49,158 --> 02:35:50,326
Looks like that's the match.

2326
02:35:54,496 --> 02:35:56,915
Damn... it...

2327
02:36:04,187 --> 02:36:10,512
<i>I heard you passed
the Second Round today...</i>

2328
02:36:11,055 --> 02:36:13,640
<i>Oh... yeah.</i>

2329
02:36:14,933 --> 02:36:16,643
<i>You did great.</i>

2330
02:36:19,164 --> 02:36:20,582
<i>I can't lose!</i>

2331
02:36:27,696 --> 02:36:28,489
Wha—?!

2332
02:36:33,035 --> 02:36:33,744
Damn it!

2333
02:36:37,873 --> 02:36:38,916
Still want to do this?

2334
02:36:45,881 --> 02:36:46,965
I lose.

2335
02:36:51,387 --> 02:36:52,554
Good grief...

2336
02:36:52,721 --> 02:36:54,598
Doesn't this scene
look familiar?

2337
02:36:57,851 --> 02:37:00,646
Boruto Uzumaki advances
to the finals!

2338
02:37:03,569 --> 02:37:06,094
Big Brother, you looked
so cool out there!

2339
02:37:12,783 --> 02:37:13,784
Young Lord!

2340
02:37:13,885 --> 02:37:16,179
Congratulations on making it
to the finals!

2341
02:37:17,761 --> 02:37:20,097
Oh, it's you, Katasuke.

2342
02:37:20,185 --> 02:37:21,728
You are amazing...

2343
02:37:22,501 --> 02:37:25,650
It's still in the development stage,
and only one Shadow Clone is possible...

2344
02:37:25,754 --> 02:37:28,841
yet you used it so ingeniously.
So marvelous!

2345
02:37:32,095 --> 02:37:33,596
This is a supplement.

2346
02:37:34,430 --> 02:37:37,891
I look forward to another
impressive showing in the final.

2347
02:37:40,436 --> 02:37:42,271
Yeah, I know.

2348
02:37:44,398 --> 02:37:45,649
You and I, Young Lord...

2349
02:37:45,674 --> 02:37:50,220
Let us breathe new life into
this stuffy old world of shinobi!

2350
02:37:57,911 --> 02:37:59,079
Oh, there he is.

2351
02:37:59,705 --> 02:38:00,998
There we go.

2352
02:38:02,791 --> 02:38:03,792
That was a close one.

2353
02:38:04,168 --> 02:38:07,588
Yup. All three of us
were almost there.

2354
02:38:10,385 --> 02:38:11,761
I didn't think losing...

2355
02:38:12,998 --> 02:38:14,750
would hurt like this.

2356
02:38:17,389 --> 02:38:18,182
Yum!

2357
02:38:18,682 --> 02:38:19,683
Really?

2358
02:38:21,351 --> 02:38:23,520
You should hurt a little more.

2359
02:38:24,188 --> 02:38:26,356
Potato chips that have been finished
aren't worth wasting time over.

2360
02:38:26,732 --> 02:38:30,152
So that's why
I open up another bag!

2361
02:38:30,319 --> 02:38:33,113
Even her brain is greasy!

2362
02:38:33,780 --> 02:38:34,531
I really...

2363
02:38:35,103 --> 02:38:36,563
did my best.

2364
02:38:37,784 --> 02:38:41,121
I thought I could win, you know?

2365
02:38:44,958 --> 02:38:46,251
So, let's do our best
in the next one.

2366
02:38:46,668 --> 02:38:48,253
Our future's just beginning.

2367
02:38:48,504 --> 02:38:52,341
We're like lounge pants with
an elastic waistband.

2368
02:38:52,716 --> 02:38:55,135
There's lots and lots of room
for us to grow...

2369
02:38:55,219 --> 02:38:56,845
to the max!

2370
02:38:57,054 --> 02:38:59,765
I can never get
your questionable metaphors!

2371
02:39:01,433 --> 02:39:02,518
What the hell...

2372
02:39:02,964 --> 02:39:04,674
Is this your idea of
consoling me?

2373
02:39:07,898 --> 02:39:09,024
I guess you're right...

2374
02:39:09,608 --> 02:39:11,902
I guess becoming chunin isn't
really our thing.

2375
02:39:12,194 --> 02:39:13,278
Yup! Yup!

2376
02:39:13,570 --> 02:39:15,531
Besides... first things first...

2377
02:39:15,781 --> 02:39:17,491
We should run crying
to Moegi-sensei

2378
02:39:17,574 --> 02:39:19,493
and get her to treat us
to barbecue.

2379
02:39:19,868 --> 02:39:20,702
– That's right!
– That's right!

2380
02:39:21,161 --> 02:39:22,746
Okay, we'll have
a pity party tonight.

2381
02:39:32,381 --> 02:39:33,173
Boruto...

2382
02:39:34,049 --> 02:39:34,591
Hmm?

2383
02:39:35,384 --> 02:39:38,512
You'd better not mess up
in the finals!

2384
02:39:40,297 --> 02:39:42,924
Y-Yeah... leave it me!

2385
02:39:43,157 --> 02:39:45,159
What? That sounds so unconvincing.

2386
02:39:46,098 --> 02:39:47,767
We'll be watching the matches.

2387
02:39:48,051 --> 02:39:49,219
Do your best!

2388
02:39:49,623 --> 02:39:51,041
Yeah! Thanks!

2389
02:39:51,118 --> 02:39:53,708
Oh! I don't think Moegi-sensei is going to
be able to afford BBQ,

2390
02:39:53,733 --> 02:39:54,901
with her salary and all...

2391
02:39:54,926 --> 02:39:58,262
What? But I'm in the mood
for their extra special kalbi!

2392
02:39:58,287 --> 02:40:01,290
Just endure for a bit with the extra
special kalbi-flavored potato chips.

2393
02:40:08,098 --> 02:40:08,723
All right!

2394
02:40:09,293 --> 02:40:10,207
Sarada!

2395
02:40:10,919 --> 02:40:14,256
I'm handing over the role
of heroine to you today!

2396
02:40:14,965 --> 02:40:15,882
Thank you!

2397
02:40:16,091 --> 02:40:19,177
Sorry for getting into
the finals before you.

2398
02:40:19,386 --> 02:40:22,055
It's fine, I'll be right there
with you soon.

2399
02:40:22,264 --> 02:40:24,141
Don't get careless
and let him slip you up.

2400
02:40:24,516 --> 02:40:26,893
Be extra careful around
that Araya guy!

2401
02:40:27,546 --> 02:40:29,923
He doesn't even blink if
an explosion goes off near him.

2402
02:40:30,188 --> 02:40:33,650
His composure shows he's gone
through considerable training.

2403
02:40:33,972 --> 02:40:35,598
That guy's not normal.

2404
02:40:35,944 --> 02:40:37,904
Who do you think
you're talking to here?

2405
02:40:38,349 --> 02:40:40,435
I'm going to become the Hokage!

2406
02:40:40,699 --> 02:40:42,284
I won't let it end here.

2407
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:50,709
Hey...

2408
02:40:51,918 --> 02:40:54,630
Good job, you guys,
you were all so close too!

2409
02:40:54,796 --> 02:40:56,923
Well, no use getting depressed
about it.

2410
02:40:57,299 --> 02:40:58,967
You guys experienced
the same thing, right?

2411
02:40:59,259 --> 02:41:01,303
Let's just cheer for them and
give them our full support.

2412
02:41:01,486 --> 02:41:02,195
– Yeah!
– Right.

2413
02:41:02,531 --> 02:41:03,323
It's starting!

2414
02:41:04,300 --> 02:41:05,801
Match Two of the semi-finals...

2415
02:41:06,266 --> 02:41:10,103
Sarada Uchiha of the Hidden Leaf
versus Araya of the Hidden Sand.

2416
02:41:10,729 --> 02:41:11,364
Begin!

2417
02:41:23,593 --> 02:41:24,135
<i>Go!</i>

2418
02:41:32,882 --> 02:41:36,177
You're keeping calm
and just observing?

2419
02:41:36,556 --> 02:41:38,057
In that case,
I'll do that too!

2420
02:41:55,206 --> 02:41:56,916
<i>I can't keep up with
my Sharingan!</i>

2421
02:42:02,932 --> 02:42:04,767
Sarada is amazing!

2422
02:42:05,140 --> 02:42:07,767
She's using her Sharingan to
anticipate her opponent's moves!

2423
02:42:08,292 --> 02:42:11,337
But that Araya guy is
countering everything!

2424
02:42:15,156 --> 02:42:17,450
As expected, the Uchiha's Sharingan
is quite something.

2425
02:42:28,740 --> 02:42:30,617
You can talk?

2426
02:42:30,875 --> 02:42:33,544
You've been so quiet,
I thought maybe you couldn't!

2427
02:42:33,682 --> 02:42:34,850
Nonsense!

2428
02:42:38,978 --> 02:42:39,646
Watch out!

2429
02:42:41,778 --> 02:42:42,904
It's not over yet.

2430
02:42:50,860 --> 02:42:51,861
Sarada!

2431
02:43:00,063 --> 02:43:04,734
Did Sarada try to use genjutsu
to stop her foe's moves?

2432
02:43:04,843 --> 02:43:05,635
Yeah...

2433
02:43:05,660 --> 02:43:07,370
But it seems like
it didn't work out.

2434
02:43:07,763 --> 02:43:08,805
That's impossible!

2435
02:43:09,150 --> 02:43:10,652
Surprise attacks don't even faze him...

2436
02:43:10,773 --> 02:43:12,066
Genjutsu don't even work...

2437
02:43:12,300 --> 02:43:13,468
What's going on?!

2438
02:43:13,631 --> 02:43:15,466
Is he really human?!

2439
02:43:16,271 --> 02:43:18,148
<i>Why won't genjutsu work on him?</i>

2440
02:43:21,876 --> 02:43:24,838
<i>My timing was perfect.
But still...</i>

2441
02:43:29,190 --> 02:43:31,734
<i>As one would expect
for a Sand shinobi.</i>

2442
02:43:32,180 --> 02:43:33,431
<i>Is he just stronger than me?!</i>

2443
02:43:35,418 --> 02:43:37,128
<i>No, it can't be!</i>

2444
02:43:37,785 --> 02:43:40,079
<i>At the very least, someone who
isn't affected when faced</i>

2445
02:43:40,104 --> 02:43:42,690
<i>with a Sharingan-based genjutsu
for the first time would...</i>

2446
02:43:45,049 --> 02:43:47,635
<i>Isn't the Hidden Sand Village...?</i>

2447
02:43:59,189 --> 02:44:00,899
If this continues,
it's going to be bad...

2448
02:44:01,233 --> 02:44:02,025
Sarada!

2449
02:44:02,134 --> 02:44:03,094
Move away from him!

2450
02:44:03,714 --> 02:44:05,966
Seems you can still move,
even with that wound.

2451
02:44:08,272 --> 02:44:09,399
But it's useless.

2452
02:44:09,647 --> 02:44:12,858
I've done my research on
the shinobi of the Hidden Leaf.

2453
02:44:17,707 --> 02:44:20,377
I know you're really smart too.

2454
02:44:21,006 --> 02:44:22,508
It'll be a drag if
this gets drawn out,

2455
02:44:22,712 --> 02:44:24,631
so why don't we wrap
this up quickly?

2456
02:44:34,933 --> 02:44:36,768
Did you use up
all your strength?

2457
02:44:37,407 --> 02:44:38,324
Well then...

2458
02:44:39,273 --> 02:44:40,900
<i>Lightning Style: Lightning Ball!</i>

2459
02:44:48,530 --> 02:44:50,156
<i>Leaf Hurricane!</i>

2460
02:44:54,411 --> 02:44:56,121
Where was she aiming at?

2461
02:44:56,288 --> 02:44:56,955
No...

2462
02:44:57,539 --> 02:44:58,206
Look.

2463
02:44:58,707 --> 02:44:59,624
What the hell?

2464
02:45:00,025 --> 02:45:01,568
Thank you, Metal!

2465
02:45:02,002 --> 02:45:04,129
That was nothi—!

2466
02:45:05,246 --> 02:45:06,205
Everyone!

2467
02:45:06,230 --> 02:45:08,685
– Uh... it's not... ah!
– What's going on?

2468
02:45:12,115 --> 02:45:13,116
All right.

2469
02:45:13,263 --> 02:45:14,931
You can't run away anymore.

2470
02:45:21,512 --> 02:45:22,847
There's someone all
the way up there!

2471
02:45:23,019 --> 02:45:23,603
Wha—?!

2472
02:45:23,628 --> 02:45:24,128
Huh?

2473
02:45:24,153 --> 02:45:25,571
What? A twin?

2474
02:45:27,105 --> 02:45:27,815
No way!

2475
02:45:30,470 --> 02:45:32,180
You're the real one, aren't you?

2476
02:45:32,333 --> 02:45:33,376
You Puppet User!

2477
02:45:34,133 --> 02:45:34,968
What?!

2478
02:45:36,836 --> 02:45:37,962
Did she say puppet?

2479
02:45:39,581 --> 02:45:42,709
Wh-When did you f-figure it out?

2480
02:45:42,876 --> 02:45:45,253
I sensed something wasn't right
from the very beginning.

2481
02:45:46,212 --> 02:45:47,714
No matter how disciplined,

2482
02:45:48,006 --> 02:45:50,800
when something suddenly
happens before your eyes,

2483
02:45:50,825 --> 02:45:53,244
humans react unconsciously.

2484
02:45:54,219 --> 02:45:55,887
But you definitely didn't...

2485
02:45:56,765 --> 02:46:01,181
Also, your almost inhuman,
machine-like movements that

2486
02:46:01,628 --> 02:46:05,273
my Sharingan couldn't keep up with,
that were unaffected by genjutsu...

2487
02:46:05,665 --> 02:46:06,875
That's when I remembered.

2488
02:46:07,649 --> 02:46:11,487
That the Sand Village possesses
an outstanding puppet technique.

2489
02:46:11,829 --> 02:46:13,789
I-is t-that all?

2490
02:46:14,115 --> 02:46:15,700
Oh, and one more thing.

2491
02:46:16,054 --> 02:46:19,557
When I was at a disadvantage,
you rushed to finish the fight.

2492
02:46:20,830 --> 02:46:22,082
Don't you get it?

2493
02:46:22,332 --> 02:46:24,376
If you did research on me,

2494
02:46:24,440 --> 02:46:26,984
you should know about
the Sharingan's weakness...

2495
02:46:27,390 --> 02:46:30,226
The Sharingan consumes
an enormous amount of chakra.

2496
02:46:30,812 --> 02:46:32,605
So Sarada's weakness is...

2497
02:46:33,266 --> 02:46:34,267
– Stamina, huh?
– It's stamina.

2498
02:46:34,928 --> 02:46:37,514
If you intended to beat me,
the smartest move would've been

2499
02:46:37,539 --> 02:46:39,791
to prolong the battle and
force me to run out of chakra.

2500
02:46:40,234 --> 02:46:42,945
Instead, you tried to end it all at once.

2501
02:46:44,187 --> 02:46:46,064
And that's what convinced me that

2502
02:46:47,094 --> 02:46:50,973
you were afraid of a long,
drawn-out battle, weren't you?

2503
02:46:51,474 --> 02:46:52,975
Because if I were to
observe you carefully,

2504
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:54,418
you wouldn't be able to
keep your secret hidden.

2505
02:46:57,329 --> 02:46:59,874
Those chakra threads you use
to control your puppet!

2506
02:47:00,203 --> 02:47:05,150
Hey! If a competitor isn't in the battle
arena, isn't that a disqualification?

2507
02:47:05,314 --> 02:47:08,759
Sure, if you leave in the middle
of a match, you're disqualified.

2508
02:47:08,891 --> 02:47:11,502
If you weren't there from the very start,
there's no cause for disqualification.

2509
02:47:11,958 --> 02:47:13,668
Right, Lord Kazekage?

2510
02:47:14,092 --> 02:47:15,927
Do you have a complaint?

2511
02:47:16,759 --> 02:47:19,220
We need to amend the rules,
you know.

2512
02:47:22,197 --> 02:47:23,462
He hasn't moved for a while.

2513
02:47:23,970 --> 02:47:26,347
What's he after this time?

2514
02:47:27,313 --> 02:47:28,064
No...

2515
02:47:28,467 --> 02:47:30,344
He's... trembling.

2516
02:47:31,034 --> 02:47:32,994
Wh-What am I s-supposed to d-do?

2517
02:47:33,019 --> 02:47:36,022
I-I... don't like...
being the c-center of attention...

2518
02:47:36,154 --> 02:47:39,157
Is he nervous because
we're all looking at him?

2519
02:47:39,353 --> 02:47:40,688
He's just like Metal.

2520
02:47:40,713 --> 02:47:43,007
A-Am I... like that?

2521
02:47:43,551 --> 02:47:45,595
No wonder he uses
a puppet to fight!

2522
02:47:46,247 --> 02:47:47,832
There's his bad habit...

2523
02:47:51,316 --> 02:47:52,066
Araya...

2524
02:47:59,587 --> 02:48:00,588
Shinki...?

2525
02:48:02,258 --> 02:48:03,885
I-It's too late!

2526
02:48:04,062 --> 02:48:06,648
You can't turn the tide...
in the condition you're in!

2527
02:48:10,975 --> 02:48:12,226
I wonder about that.

2528
02:48:14,889 --> 02:48:16,704
<i>Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!</i>

2529
02:48:32,812 --> 02:48:33,604
The match ends here!

2530
02:48:33,962 --> 02:48:35,922
The winner is Sarada Uchiha!

2531
02:48:41,698 --> 02:48:42,907
You didn't do enough research!

2532
02:48:43,431 --> 02:48:45,475
We're progressing every day!

2533
02:48:45,820 --> 02:48:47,780
Don't you dare underestimate
Leaf shinobi!

2534
02:48:49,044 --> 02:48:50,253
You did it, Sarada!

2535
02:48:50,544 --> 02:48:51,295
Yeah well...

2536
02:48:51,454 --> 02:48:52,580
Those were amazing jutsu!

2537
02:48:53,279 --> 02:48:54,739
I haven't mastered it yet,

2538
02:48:54,907 --> 02:48:58,410
so I can only use it against
someone coming straight at me.

2539
02:49:00,161 --> 02:49:02,872
But never mind me.
Mitsuki, you're up next.

2540
02:49:03,242 --> 02:49:04,077
You know, right?

2541
02:49:04,478 --> 02:49:06,605
The finals will be between Team 7!

2542
02:49:07,898 --> 02:49:11,568
Mitsuki, in the next one,
show 'em how serious you are!

2543
02:49:17,467 --> 02:49:21,429
We will now move on
to match three of the semi-finals.

2544
02:49:22,254 --> 02:49:25,633
Mitsuki of the Leaf
versus Shinki of the Sand!

2545
02:49:25,807 --> 02:49:26,683
Begin!

2546
02:49:28,912 --> 02:49:29,913
Amazing...

2547
02:49:30,645 --> 02:49:31,912
<i>Wind Style: Breakthrough.</i>

2548
02:49:43,658 --> 02:49:44,701
I've got you.

2549
02:49:51,833 --> 02:49:53,209
Interesting magic trick.

2550
02:49:53,626 --> 02:49:54,961
What will you pull out next?

2551
02:49:55,170 --> 02:49:55,962
A pigeon?

2552
02:49:56,671 --> 02:49:58,548
I can only produce snakes.

2553
02:50:00,758 --> 02:50:02,635
You use unusual jutsu as well.

2554
02:50:03,120 --> 02:50:05,330
How do you manipulate
Iron Sand like that anyway?

2555
02:50:05,954 --> 02:50:09,166
It's probably the same type of
technique that Uncle Gaara uses.

2556
02:50:09,480 --> 02:50:10,397
That's right...

2557
02:50:10,613 --> 02:50:13,115
He's the adopted son of
the Kazekage, isn't he?

2558
02:50:14,685 --> 02:50:17,688
Well, he may have the Kazekage,
but we have guts!

2559
02:50:17,713 --> 02:50:18,756
Mitsuki!

2560
02:50:18,900 --> 02:50:21,778
My father personally
taught me this jutsu.

2561
02:50:22,367 --> 02:50:24,036
Although you couldn't
possibly understand.

2562
02:50:24,618 --> 02:50:25,410
Hmm...

2563
02:50:25,631 --> 02:50:28,175
I see... Well, I don't really
care either way.

2564
02:50:28,956 --> 02:50:30,207
<i>Wind Style: Wind Scythe.</i>

2565
02:50:30,538 --> 02:50:31,456
It's pointless.

2566
02:50:34,118 --> 02:50:35,202
Dodge it, Mitsuki!

2567
02:50:55,396 --> 02:50:58,066
Snakes again... Was it a clone?

2568
02:50:58,604 --> 02:50:59,772
<i>Striking Shadow Snake Assault.</i>

2569
02:51:10,662 --> 02:51:12,372
That's what I call
an impenetrable iron wall...

2570
02:51:12,683 --> 02:51:14,060
But how about this?

2571
02:51:16,501 --> 02:51:17,877
<i>Striking Shadow Snake Burial.</i>

2572
02:51:27,266 --> 02:51:28,183
Hey, c'mon...

2573
02:51:28,208 --> 02:51:29,793
I know a battle's a battle, but...

2574
02:51:29,999 --> 02:51:31,417
he might die.

2575
02:51:38,459 --> 02:51:39,377
Yeah, you're right.

2576
02:51:39,723 --> 02:51:41,100
I felt no resistance in my hands.

2577
02:51:45,398 --> 02:51:46,691
An Iron Sand Clone?!

2578
02:51:46,926 --> 02:51:47,593
Damn it...

2579
02:51:47,697 --> 02:51:49,157
I thought he had him!

2580
02:51:49,381 --> 02:51:51,675
To think that surprise attack
had no effect on him!

2581
02:51:52,066 --> 02:51:54,234
I've taught Shinki everything
I know.

2582
02:51:54,896 --> 02:51:57,774
His true skills are
much greater than this.

2583
02:51:58,338 --> 02:52:01,950
You didn't even take a step until
now, and you resorted to a clone?

2584
02:52:03,807 --> 02:52:05,184
So, did I surprise you a little?

2585
02:52:05,905 --> 02:52:06,586
Yeah.

2586
02:52:07,586 --> 02:52:09,796
But Father taught me to
never let my guard down,

2587
02:52:09,821 --> 02:52:11,197
especially in a situation
like this.

2588
02:52:12,254 --> 02:52:14,215
He said his former rivals
long ago were like that.

2589
02:52:14,240 --> 02:52:15,908
That's what he taught me.

2590
02:52:16,752 --> 02:52:18,712
What about you, Mitsuki?

2591
02:52:19,838 --> 02:52:22,758
Show me more...
of your strength!

2592
02:52:24,295 --> 02:52:25,922
Mitsuki, go for it!

2593
02:52:26,842 --> 02:52:29,261
<i>Cheap tricks won't
affect him anymore.</i>

2594
02:52:30,251 --> 02:52:32,753
<i>What would Boruto do
in a situation like this?</i>

2595
02:52:39,375 --> 02:52:41,127
<i>Lightning Style: Snake Lightning!</i>

2596
02:53:01,328 --> 02:53:02,872
Damn it, he got him!

2597
02:53:03,854 --> 02:53:06,691
He deliberately let Mitsuki
destroy his Iron Sand wall

2598
02:53:06,861 --> 02:53:10,031
and made him think he had
an opening to attack.

2599
02:53:10,406 --> 02:53:13,826
Yeah, in that situation,
anyone would have done that.

2600
02:53:14,853 --> 02:53:16,813
<i>He's using a considerable amount
of jutsu.</i>

2601
02:53:16,951 --> 02:53:18,744
<i>He only has a slight amount
of chakra left!</i>

2602
02:53:19,365 --> 02:53:21,242
<i>What are you going to do, Mitsuki?!</i>

2603
02:53:22,819 --> 02:53:23,946
Is this it?

2604
02:53:24,417 --> 02:53:27,212
I know you have something
more up your sleeve...

2605
02:53:30,626 --> 02:53:34,421
I understand where
your complacency comes from.

2606
02:53:35,157 --> 02:53:36,325
I'm going to make you show me.

2607
02:53:39,296 --> 02:53:42,616
With that attack earlier, I placed
an Iron Sand Marking on you.

2608
02:53:43,113 --> 02:53:45,073
I take it that you know about
the properties of the Iron Sand.

2609
02:53:46,298 --> 02:53:47,090
Magnetic force.

2610
02:53:47,592 --> 02:53:48,217
That's right.

2611
02:53:48,919 --> 02:53:51,380
My inescapable spear will
pierce right through you.

2612
02:53:53,667 --> 02:53:56,920
<i>It's true, I have no choices
left in this situation.</i>

2613
02:53:57,934 --> 02:53:59,393
<i>For me to defeat him,</i>

2614
02:53:59,470 --> 02:54:00,971
<i>I'll have to undergo
Sage Transformation...</i>

2615
02:54:11,602 --> 02:54:12,936
<i>Now, show me!</i>

2616
02:54:13,564 --> 02:54:14,732
<i>That power!</i>

2617
02:54:18,881 --> 02:54:19,631
I give up.

2618
02:54:26,689 --> 02:54:28,316
Did I hear you correctly?

2619
02:54:29,357 --> 02:54:30,150
You heard me correctly.

2620
02:54:30,880 --> 02:54:32,340
I just said, "I give up."

2621
02:54:34,764 --> 02:54:36,474
Mitsuki, what did you just say?

2622
02:54:37,294 --> 02:54:38,087
I submit.

2623
02:54:39,373 --> 02:54:39,998
But...!

2624
02:54:40,361 --> 02:54:41,695
It's fine... this way.

2625
02:54:43,165 --> 02:54:43,958
I understand.

2626
02:54:47,066 --> 02:54:49,402
The winner,
Shinki of the Sand!

2627
02:54:50,110 --> 02:54:50,861
What?

2628
02:54:51,205 --> 02:54:52,539
What happened to Mitsuki?

2629
02:54:53,050 --> 02:54:54,177
Did he get injured somewhere?

2630
02:54:54,488 --> 02:54:56,824
Don't ask me! I don't know!

2631
02:55:01,726 --> 02:55:02,393
Wait!

2632
02:55:03,717 --> 02:55:05,469
Damn you, why?

2633
02:55:08,776 --> 02:55:12,363
If we had continued any further,
it might inconvenience my parent.

2634
02:55:15,417 --> 02:55:17,544
It's because I want
to stay here longer...

2635
02:55:18,378 --> 02:55:19,546
Compared to that desire,

2636
02:55:19,808 --> 02:55:22,394
I don't really care about
the outcome of this match.

2637
02:55:26,973 --> 02:55:28,968
It seems I was
totally wrong about you...

2638
02:55:32,059 --> 02:55:32,726
<i>Well...</i>

2639
02:55:33,122 --> 02:55:36,150
<i>I still don't know if I would've
won even if I'd gone all out.</i>

2640
02:55:37,067 --> 02:55:38,736
What are you doing, Mitsuki?!

2641
02:55:39,050 --> 02:55:40,385
Did you get hurt somewhere?

2642
02:55:43,287 --> 02:55:44,872
Wh-What is it?

2643
02:55:46,622 --> 02:55:47,289
Sorry!

2644
02:55:47,574 --> 02:55:48,283
– Huh?
– Huh?

2645
02:55:48,567 --> 02:55:50,152
No, that's not right.

2646
02:55:50,724 --> 02:55:52,810
It's more like I look forward to working
with you from now on?

2647
02:55:53,247 --> 02:55:54,957
Yup. I have a feeling
it's going to be like that.

2648
02:55:56,364 --> 02:55:58,074
What happened to him?

2649
02:56:02,918 --> 02:56:05,170
The finals will be held tomorrow.

2650
02:56:06,121 --> 02:56:07,539
They are... Shinki of the Sand,

2651
02:56:07,984 --> 02:56:09,903
Sarada Uchiha of the Leaf,

2652
02:56:10,398 --> 02:56:13,025
and also from the Leaf,
Boruto Uzumaki.

2653
02:56:13,591 --> 02:56:16,427
Finalists! Please bring
your absolute best to the matches!

2654
02:56:16,765 --> 02:56:17,474
– Sir!
– Sir!

2655
02:56:24,286 --> 02:56:25,704
What is this?

2656
02:56:25,875 --> 02:56:28,444
I brought you here because you
said you were craving barbecue...

2657
02:56:28,726 --> 02:56:31,645
Sure, it's too bad that you lost, but...

2658
02:56:31,949 --> 02:56:35,473
you guys put your all into it
and I'm sure everyone saw that.

2659
02:56:36,262 --> 02:56:38,723
The meat is... so thin.

2660
02:56:38,904 --> 02:56:39,447
Huh?

2661
02:56:39,907 --> 02:56:41,200
Well, it can't be helped.

2662
02:56:41,225 --> 02:56:42,684
Payday hasn't rolled around yet!

2663
02:56:42,709 --> 02:56:43,710
Moegi-sensei...

2664
02:56:44,736 --> 02:56:46,947
Are we lacking something?

2665
02:56:48,124 --> 02:56:49,208
Well...

2666
02:56:49,636 --> 02:56:52,514
You know, you don't have to
know the answer to that yet.

2667
02:56:53,606 --> 02:56:57,818
Just now, were you thinking
of how to beat Boruto in a rematch?

2668
02:57:00,752 --> 02:57:01,628
Okay then.

2669
02:57:02,209 --> 02:57:04,878
Your training for the next Chunin Exams
has already begun.

2670
02:57:05,536 --> 02:57:07,455
And from tomorrow,
we'll begin special training again!

2671
02:57:08,795 --> 02:57:09,421
Right!

2672
02:57:10,895 --> 02:57:12,062
Thanks for waiting!

2673
02:57:12,087 --> 02:57:12,880
Yay!

2674
02:57:13,475 --> 02:57:15,477
Our special combo platter...

2675
02:57:15,512 --> 02:57:16,930
– 20 servings!
– The meat's here!

2676
02:57:17,080 --> 02:57:18,040
Huh?!

2677
02:57:20,127 --> 02:57:22,171
Wh-What's the meaning of this?

2678
02:57:22,656 --> 02:57:24,408
I think you have the wrong table!

2679
02:57:24,782 --> 02:57:26,909
You guys were deep
in conversation,

2680
02:57:27,079 --> 02:57:28,914
so I went ahead and
ordered for us.

2681
02:57:30,272 --> 02:57:32,274
Well, we can't let it go to waste.

2682
02:57:32,543 --> 02:57:33,836
Let's eat.

2683
02:57:34,442 --> 02:57:36,026
Hey Cho-Cho...
Don't you want some?

2684
02:57:37,473 --> 02:57:38,933
You guys!

2685
02:57:39,216 --> 02:57:41,093
– And here's your bill!
– Cho-cho, give me some meat too.

2686
02:57:43,049 --> 02:57:44,134
Don't you want any?

2687
02:57:44,639 --> 02:57:46,098
If you don't want any,

2688
02:57:46,123 --> 02:57:47,249
– I'll eat it for you!
– Hey, don't eat it!

2689
02:57:48,765 --> 02:57:50,350
Are you okay, Sarada?

2690
02:57:50,759 --> 02:57:52,553
Yeah, it doesn't hurt anymore.

2691
02:57:53,235 --> 02:57:54,903
You were pretty reckless
out there.

2692
02:57:55,617 --> 02:57:58,036
Well, I am your daughter,
after all.

2693
02:57:58,903 --> 02:57:59,820
Seriously!

2694
02:58:00,236 --> 02:58:02,613
So, when did you learn
the Fireball Jutsu?

2695
02:58:03,300 --> 02:58:05,094
I asked Dad to teach me.

2696
02:58:05,551 --> 02:58:07,595
I can't do it that well yet, though.

2697
02:58:09,736 --> 02:58:12,364
Hey, Dad's not coming home
tonight again?

2698
02:58:12,611 --> 02:58:16,281
He should just relax
at home since he's back.

2699
02:58:17,022 --> 02:58:19,149
It's fine this way for him.

2700
02:58:20,070 --> 02:58:23,991
And besides, he comes home
to sleep late at night once in a while...

2701
02:58:24,867 --> 02:58:26,702
when you aren't aware.

2702
02:58:28,097 --> 02:58:30,849
Your father's been helping
Lord Seventh all this time,

2703
02:58:30,874 --> 02:58:32,459
and the work he does
is very difficult.

2704
02:58:33,205 --> 02:58:36,625
It's hard, but his work is for
the benefit of this world.

2705
02:58:37,733 --> 02:58:38,901
Hmm...

2706
02:58:39,443 --> 02:58:41,195
That's very brave of you, Mom.

2707
02:58:41,570 --> 02:58:43,781
Hey, don't tease your mother!

2708
02:58:44,323 --> 02:58:45,324
Okay!

2709
02:58:46,360 --> 02:58:46,902
<i>Chidori!</i>

2710
02:58:49,829 --> 02:58:51,163
Amazing!

2711
02:58:51,265 --> 02:58:53,309
That's Old Man Kakashi's jutsu, huh?!

2712
02:58:54,625 --> 02:58:56,544
Hey, teach me that jutsu!

2713
02:58:56,919 --> 02:58:57,670
I can't.

2714
02:58:57,837 --> 02:58:59,088
Aw, meanie!

2715
02:58:59,596 --> 02:59:00,879
This jutsu is only complete

2716
02:59:00,904 --> 02:59:03,819
when you have the visual insight
of the Sharingan.

2717
02:59:04,485 --> 02:59:06,612
Then why did
you show it to me?

2718
02:59:07,522 --> 02:59:10,150
Your chakra has
a strong Lightning Nature.

2719
02:59:11,171 --> 02:59:13,991
Work to improve the precision of
seals that configure the Lightning Style.

2720
02:59:14,937 --> 02:59:17,356
In time, you'll be able to
use powerful techniques.

2721
02:59:18,123 --> 02:59:20,209
Start off by trying the basics.

2722
02:59:20,943 --> 02:59:22,111
Yes sir...

2723
02:59:22,136 --> 02:59:24,138
So, you're saying
if I work hard at it,

2724
02:59:24,163 --> 02:59:26,665
I'll be able to use techniques
like the Chidori, right?

2725
02:59:26,907 --> 02:59:28,284
I got it.

2726
02:59:29,744 --> 02:59:33,664
There once was a man who
refused to heed the words of others,

2727
02:59:33,904 --> 02:59:36,490
and sought power regardless
of the method...

2728
02:59:36,798 --> 02:59:39,301
and tried to change
the world all by himself.

2729
02:59:40,129 --> 02:59:41,255
Yeah?

2730
02:59:41,297 --> 02:59:43,007
And what happened to him?

2731
02:59:43,716 --> 02:59:45,092
He paid for it dearly.

2732
02:59:45,539 --> 02:59:48,208
However, in the end,
a friend saved him.

2733
02:59:48,893 --> 02:59:51,062
So, in short,
friends are important, right?

2734
02:59:52,881 --> 02:59:54,767
I'm all good when it comes to that.

2735
02:59:56,259 --> 02:59:58,970
I have great people all around me!

2736
03:00:00,411 --> 03:00:01,204
I see.

2737
03:00:05,322 --> 03:00:08,117
And now, we'll begin the finals!

2738
03:00:15,414 --> 03:00:17,708
<i>You definitely can
win this, Boruto!</i>

2739
03:00:17,792 --> 03:00:19,710
<i>Give it everything
you've got, Boruto!</i>

2740
03:00:19,812 --> 03:00:22,606
<i>Don't lose to Shinki,
or Sarada either!</i>

2741
03:00:23,056 --> 03:00:26,393
<i>You beat me,
so you'd better keep on winning.</i>

2742
03:00:26,592 --> 03:00:30,221
<i>And if you don't, you'll be paying
for the pity party, okay?</i>

2743
03:00:31,388 --> 03:00:32,515
<i>You guys...</i>

2744
03:00:36,268 --> 03:00:38,145
<i>Yeah! Leave it to me!</i>

2745
03:00:49,865 --> 03:00:53,160
We will now begin the final round
of the Chunin Exams!

2746
03:00:55,204 --> 03:00:56,705
I made it all the way here.

2747
03:00:58,207 --> 03:01:01,252
I can't lose.
I definitely can't!

2748
03:01:08,175 --> 03:01:10,678
The final match will be held
in battle royale format.

2749
03:01:11,095 --> 03:01:12,346
Of these three,

2750
03:01:12,346 --> 03:01:16,141
the last one standing
shall be declared the winner!

2751
03:01:16,744 --> 03:01:17,745
And now...

2752
03:01:18,227 --> 03:01:19,000
Begin!

2753
03:01:24,400 --> 03:01:27,903
Ahhh...
He's going to attack two at once?

2754
03:01:28,612 --> 03:01:29,947
Is he an idiot?

2755
03:01:30,155 --> 03:01:33,534
It's a 3-way battle.
He's only inviting defeat.

2756
03:01:33,585 --> 03:01:37,839
Or, it must mean
he's that confident about himself.

2757
03:01:40,916 --> 03:01:44,086
My jutsu is good for facing
multiple opponents simultaneously.

2758
03:01:44,336 --> 03:01:47,715
I'll easily take you two on
at the same time!

2759
03:01:48,674 --> 03:01:50,050
He's really underestimating us.

2760
03:01:50,075 --> 03:01:51,076
Hey, Boruto!

2761
03:01:54,763 --> 03:01:57,641
He's strong. Do you want to
join forces for this?

2762
03:01:58,225 --> 03:02:00,019
And get some payback for Mitsuki?

2763
03:02:00,311 --> 03:02:01,437
There's that too...

2764
03:02:02,813 --> 03:02:05,107
But for me personally...
This is our home ground.

2765
03:02:05,190 --> 03:02:07,985
It would be disgraceful
for two Leaf shinobi to lose.

2766
03:02:08,068 --> 03:02:10,029
We can't let
the Five Kage see that!

2767
03:02:10,054 --> 03:02:12,348
I could care less about that, but...

2768
03:02:14,158 --> 03:02:15,701
I'm with you on that...

2769
03:02:16,619 --> 03:02:17,912
I can't lose either!

2770
03:02:20,497 --> 03:02:23,626
But we could end up attacking
at the same time.

2771
03:02:23,959 --> 03:02:26,253
If there's an opening,
just take it.

2772
03:02:26,712 --> 03:02:29,715
So, I guess we have a united front.

2773
03:02:31,008 --> 03:02:32,259
Fine with me.

2774
03:02:33,135 --> 03:02:36,555
I'll show you that,
you can't destroy my Iron Wall.

2775
03:02:37,389 --> 03:02:40,017
Oh yeah?
Then let's just test it and see!

2776
03:02:40,809 --> 03:02:42,102
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

2777
03:02:51,028 --> 03:02:53,030
<i>Fire Style! Fireball Jutsu!</i>

2778
03:03:01,789 --> 03:03:05,292
Wow!
Those two have some flashy moves!

2779
03:03:05,501 --> 03:03:06,710
But they're up against a strong foe

2780
03:03:06,752 --> 03:03:08,587
who made it this far without
so much as a scratch.

2781
03:03:09,153 --> 03:03:12,407
But those two have teamed up,
so I'm sure they'll manage!

2782
03:03:12,925 --> 03:03:16,220
They'd better.
Otherwise, I'd lose face.

2783
03:03:23,727 --> 03:03:24,853
What is that?

2784
03:03:28,440 --> 03:03:29,817
I already told you...

2785
03:03:30,460 --> 03:03:31,628
My Iron Wall is impenetrable.

2786
03:03:36,782 --> 03:03:39,410
I see... It's more than I expected...

2787
03:03:39,785 --> 03:03:42,371
That absolute defense
reminds me of someone.

2788
03:03:44,342 --> 03:03:45,969
The Black Iron Fist...

2789
03:03:46,792 --> 03:03:50,337
Shinki's favorite jutsu
that can both attack and defend.

2790
03:03:50,838 --> 03:03:52,256
Attack and defend?

2791
03:03:52,715 --> 03:03:53,757
Which means—!

2792
03:04:04,143 --> 03:04:05,227
What?!

2793
03:04:05,978 --> 03:04:07,646
<i>Black Iron Fist...</i>

2794
03:04:08,050 --> 03:04:08,870
<i>Eject!</i>

2795
03:04:40,888 --> 03:04:41,972
Sarada!

2796
03:04:42,222 --> 03:04:43,432
Is she okay?

2797
03:04:43,599 --> 03:04:46,101
Of course she is!
The battle's just begun.

2798
03:04:46,435 --> 03:04:48,812
It's the two of them,

2799
03:04:48,896 --> 03:04:50,481
so they're definitely
trying to think of something!

2800
03:04:53,317 --> 03:04:54,318
Damn it!

2801
03:04:54,485 --> 03:04:57,780
What's that stringy thing
that's connected to it?

2802
03:05:02,659 --> 03:05:04,286
I get it!
An electromagnetic field!

2803
03:05:04,536 --> 03:05:05,829
E-Electro what...?

2804
03:05:06,095 --> 03:05:07,847
We learned it at the Academy.

2805
03:05:08,295 --> 03:05:10,506
About manipulating Iron Sand
in a magnetic field,

2806
03:05:10,709 --> 03:05:13,212
and changing its shape
and controlling it.

2807
03:05:13,378 --> 03:05:16,006
Where did you find
such a Magnet Style user?

2808
03:05:16,507 --> 03:05:18,133
An electromagnetic field?

2809
03:05:18,509 --> 03:05:21,661
Then if we hit it with the
Lightning Style, wouldn't it work?

2810
03:05:22,137 --> 03:05:24,014
You watched his match
with Mitsuki, didn't you?

2811
03:05:26,141 --> 03:05:27,851
<i>Lightning Style: Snake Lightning!</i>

2812
03:05:33,315 --> 03:05:34,983
A superficial Lightning Style...

2813
03:05:35,234 --> 03:05:36,235
wouldn't even make him blink.

2814
03:05:37,986 --> 03:05:39,738
But how about this?

2815
03:05:41,073 --> 03:05:42,241
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

2816
03:05:44,910 --> 03:05:45,911
<i>Lightning Style:</i>

2817
03:05:47,538 --> 03:05:48,914
Sarada, you too!

2818
03:05:49,206 --> 03:05:50,624
I get it...

2819
03:05:51,333 --> 03:05:53,001
<i>Lightning Style:
Lightning Ball!</i>

2820
03:05:56,213 --> 03:05:57,214
I'm going to call this...

2821
03:05:57,339 --> 03:05:58,632
Improvised Secret Technique!

2822
03:05:58,841 --> 03:06:00,592
Lightning Ball Shuriken Jutsu!

2823
03:06:11,482 --> 03:06:12,483
With one hand?!

2824
03:06:12,688 --> 03:06:14,231
The concept isn't bad.

2825
03:06:14,648 --> 03:06:19,278
But one hand is enough
for that level of Lightning Style.

2826
03:06:23,198 --> 03:06:24,199
No way?!

2827
03:06:24,395 --> 03:06:27,648
Let me show you the difference
in absolute power.

2828
03:06:37,098 --> 03:06:40,310
Oh man.
That could be the match!

2829
03:06:40,462 --> 03:06:43,407
– No way!
– Fight back, Boruto!

2830
03:06:43,792 --> 03:06:45,335
This is bad...

2831
03:06:47,055 --> 03:06:50,350
Oh my...
Is this a Sand victory?

2832
03:06:50,809 --> 03:06:54,396
And it's two against one?
How pitiful.

2833
03:06:54,938 --> 03:06:58,859
As you just saw...
Naruto, I feel bad, but...

2834
03:07:03,614 --> 03:07:05,908
I said nothing would
suit me better, didn't I?

2835
03:07:06,241 --> 03:07:08,869
The difference in my power
compared to yours is unmistakable,

2836
03:07:08,911 --> 03:07:11,413
and I am proving it to
the Five Villages, for all to see.

2837
03:07:11,872 --> 03:07:14,875
My father overestimates
the Hidden Leaf.

2838
03:07:15,542 --> 03:07:18,962
Because of his respect for
his friend, the Seventh Hokage.

2839
03:07:19,338 --> 03:07:20,964
Because of D-Dad?!

2840
03:07:21,381 --> 03:07:23,342
I'm just proving it to him...

2841
03:07:23,842 --> 03:07:27,387
That more than the Hidden Leaf...
more than the son of the Hokage...

2842
03:07:27,471 --> 03:07:30,307
That I, whom my father
passed on all his knowledge to...

2843
03:07:30,332 --> 03:07:31,750
am the one who truly excels.

2844
03:07:34,811 --> 03:07:36,939
L-Like hell you are!

2845
03:07:40,943 --> 03:07:43,278
What are you doing, Young Lord?

2846
03:07:43,612 --> 03:07:44,696
Now...

2847
03:07:45,697 --> 03:07:46,949
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu...</i>

2848
03:07:50,077 --> 03:07:51,078
Sarada!

2849
03:07:52,829 --> 03:07:54,248
<i>Fireball Jutsu!</i>

2850
03:07:55,832 --> 03:07:56,833
I see!

2851
03:07:56,875 --> 03:07:58,752
If it's now, when the Iron Sand hands
are both occupied...

2852
03:08:04,675 --> 03:08:05,676
We're free...

2853
03:08:06,176 --> 03:08:07,427
But what do we do next?

2854
03:08:07,897 --> 03:08:09,023
My chakra's already...

2855
03:08:09,304 --> 03:08:10,514
Don't be such a weakling!

2856
03:08:10,712 --> 03:08:12,380
He's in the same situation
as us now.

2857
03:08:12,724 --> 03:08:14,268
So one more time, like before...

2858
03:08:18,397 --> 03:08:19,940
Is he going to use that?!

2859
03:08:21,191 --> 03:08:22,567
Unfortunately...

2860
03:08:22,943 --> 03:08:24,611
There won't be another time!

2861
03:08:28,686 --> 03:08:30,188
With my father watching,

2862
03:08:30,382 --> 03:08:33,177
I will prove that I am superior
to the Hidden Leaf.

2863
03:08:33,662 --> 03:08:34,913
First, you...

2864
03:08:34,938 --> 03:08:36,356
daughter of Uchiha!

2865
03:08:37,634 --> 03:08:40,220
<i>Iron Sand: Black Iron Wings!</i>

2866
03:08:42,440 --> 03:08:44,383
Don't underestimate me!

2867
03:08:50,721 --> 03:08:51,430
That's—?!

2868
03:09:02,774 --> 03:09:03,652
Sarada!

2869
03:09:25,505 --> 03:09:26,506
No way...

2870
03:09:26,715 --> 03:09:28,342
That can't be true...

2871
03:09:30,844 --> 03:09:32,888
Sarada Uchiha is unable to continue!

2872
03:09:33,513 --> 03:09:37,809
The Iron Sand I cemented to your body
acts as a homing beacon.

2873
03:09:38,435 --> 03:09:39,436
As you can see...

2874
03:09:39,744 --> 03:09:41,538
there's no way you can dodge it.

2875
03:09:41,946 --> 03:09:44,073
How dare you!

2876
03:09:44,185 --> 03:09:45,603
Now it's one on one.

2877
03:09:46,068 --> 03:09:47,152
Just as I thought...

2878
03:09:47,454 --> 03:09:50,197
the Hidden Leaf is nothing more than
rabble without their Lord Seventh.

2879
03:09:50,238 --> 03:09:51,156
What did you say?!

2880
03:09:51,656 --> 03:09:54,117
The ones I faced up to the semifinals
were the same.

2881
03:09:54,743 --> 03:09:57,454
When you grow up under
the warm protection of the Hokage,

2882
03:09:57,496 --> 03:09:58,747
I guess this is what happens.

2883
03:09:59,039 --> 03:10:01,041
Shut up! You don't know anything!

2884
03:10:02,501 --> 03:10:04,127
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

2885
03:10:10,675 --> 03:10:13,011
Is he going to do his Boruto Stream?!

2886
03:10:13,053 --> 03:10:15,138
Th-That's too reckless, Boruto!

2887
03:10:15,472 --> 03:10:17,766
He's almost used up his chakra too...

2888
03:10:23,063 --> 03:10:24,606
You want to keep struggling
until the end?

2889
03:10:25,440 --> 03:10:26,274
Fine with me.

2890
03:10:27,275 --> 03:10:29,736
Then I will show you what
devastating defeat is like.

2891
03:10:30,070 --> 03:10:31,071
Take this!

2892
03:10:33,573 --> 03:10:34,449
<i>Boruto...</i>

2893
03:10:34,491 --> 03:10:35,575
<i>Black Iron...</i>

2894
03:10:35,909 --> 03:10:37,244
<i>Stream!</i>

2895
03:10:37,244 --> 03:10:38,286
<i>Wings!</i>

2896
03:10:52,801 --> 03:10:53,510
Boruto!

2897
03:10:53,844 --> 03:10:54,511
Boruto...

2898
03:10:55,011 --> 03:10:55,804
Boruto...

2899
03:10:57,305 --> 03:10:58,432
Boruto...

2900
03:10:59,328 --> 03:11:00,138
Boruto!

2901
03:11:08,024 --> 03:11:09,943
I'm not going to let you look down...

2902
03:11:40,974 --> 03:11:42,225
on us!

2903
03:11:49,858 --> 03:11:52,569
<i>With the strength I have now...
this guy is...</i>

2904
03:11:53,612 --> 03:11:55,989
<i>More strength is required
from here on out.</i>

2905
03:11:57,073 --> 03:11:58,241
<i>Don't let this get you down.</i>

2906
03:11:58,283 --> 03:12:00,911
<i>Take your time and
build up your strength.</i>

2907
03:12:01,332 --> 03:12:03,761
<i>In time, you'll be able to
use powerful jutsu.</i>

2908
03:12:37,739 --> 03:12:38,782
"In time"...

2909
03:12:39,366 --> 03:12:40,492
isn't going to work...

2910
03:12:41,284 --> 03:12:42,035
Now!

2911
03:12:42,827 --> 03:12:45,539
I have to show my dad...
right now!

2912
03:12:46,164 --> 03:12:47,415
That I...

2913
03:12:47,582 --> 03:12:49,376
can do this!

2914
03:12:50,418 --> 03:12:51,294
<i>Purple Lightning!</i>

2915
03:12:52,337 --> 03:12:53,088
What?!

2916
03:12:53,588 --> 03:12:54,339
Purple Lightning?

2917
03:13:32,109 --> 03:13:32,985
The match ends here!

2918
03:13:34,147 --> 03:13:35,398
The winner, uh...

2919
03:13:36,006 --> 03:13:38,341
the champion is Boruto Uzumaki!

2920
03:13:41,803 --> 03:13:44,180
He did it! Boruto won!

2921
03:13:45,557 --> 03:13:46,933
way to go!

2922
03:13:46,975 --> 03:13:50,061
I had faith that he could do it!

2923
03:13:51,104 --> 03:13:52,147
He did it!

2924
03:13:52,355 --> 03:13:55,775
Imagine that...
He defeated him, instead of Sarada.

2925
03:13:56,610 --> 03:13:58,903
How many tricks does he
have up his sleeve anyway?

2926
03:13:59,529 --> 03:14:02,115
But when did he master
Lord Sixth's technique?

2927
03:14:02,407 --> 03:14:05,702
Big Brother won! He won!

2928
03:14:05,949 --> 03:14:07,742
Yes... he did...

2929
03:14:09,863 --> 03:14:11,782
I won?

2930
03:14:35,482 --> 03:14:38,568
Huh? What's with the Hokage?

2931
03:14:39,110 --> 03:14:42,155
He probably couldn't contain himself
since his son won.

2932
03:14:42,781 --> 03:14:44,658
Now there's a doting parent for you.

2933
03:14:51,665 --> 03:14:55,210
Dad! Did you see my big win?!

2934
03:15:13,142 --> 03:15:15,311
What's the meaning of this?

2935
03:15:22,654 --> 03:15:23,571
This is...

2936
03:15:29,452 --> 03:15:31,788
He's used a Scientific Ninja Tool,

2937
03:15:31,830 --> 03:15:35,500
something that's prohibited
in the Chunin Exams.

2938
03:15:36,251 --> 03:15:37,627
Scientific... Ninja Tool?

2939
03:15:38,002 --> 03:15:41,881
This shinobi gauntlet
allows one to use ninjutsu

2940
03:15:42,212 --> 03:15:45,343
without using one's own chakra,
in addition to other people's jutsu!

2941
03:15:45,927 --> 03:15:48,722
It defeats the purpose of showing
your true strength in the Exams.

2942
03:15:49,013 --> 03:15:51,725
For that, Boruto Uzumaki is disqualified.

2943
03:15:52,225 --> 03:15:55,562
We'll have to deliberate on how
we'll revise the results up to now.

2944
03:15:56,266 --> 03:15:59,645
What happened to Big Brother?
Did he do something bad?

2945
03:16:03,653 --> 03:16:04,612
Boruto...

2946
03:16:06,114 --> 03:16:07,991
I guess it's now or never!

2947
03:16:09,850 --> 03:16:14,330
Boruto Uzumaki has been disqualified
for using an illegal ninja tool!

2948
03:16:14,998 --> 03:16:17,250
I can't believe
he'd do such a thing...

2949
03:16:19,919 --> 03:16:23,256
Talk about the idiot son
who disgraces the Hokage...

2950
03:16:25,008 --> 03:16:25,717
Boruto!

2951
03:16:28,595 --> 03:16:29,888
Why did you do this?

2952
03:16:31,055 --> 03:16:35,143
You didn't...
when we fought, did you?

2953
03:16:36,895 --> 03:16:38,938
It's not like that! I—!

2954
03:16:43,401 --> 03:16:44,319
Boruto...

2955
03:16:49,240 --> 03:16:50,950
Quit! You fraud!

2956
03:16:50,975 --> 03:16:52,727
Trying to win by cheating?!

2957
03:16:52,869 --> 03:16:54,454
You're a disgrace to the Leaf!

2958
03:16:59,125 --> 03:17:02,003
So what will you do now?

2959
03:17:08,593 --> 03:17:10,512
You're disqualified as a ninja too.

2960
03:17:12,180 --> 03:17:14,891
Let's go. We'll talk later.

2961
03:17:17,715 --> 03:17:19,842
We'll talk later?

2962
03:17:21,064 --> 03:17:23,775
Do you really have time for that, Dad?

2963
03:17:24,067 --> 03:17:25,819
If you'd talked to me before...

2964
03:17:27,570 --> 03:17:28,321
I...

2965
03:17:30,106 --> 03:17:33,943
I... wouldn't have ended up
in this situation now!

2966
03:17:39,374 --> 03:17:41,084
He's right, you know.

2967
03:17:41,324 --> 03:17:43,087
Boruto wasn't able to win,

2968
03:17:43,275 --> 03:17:46,695
and we're so disappointed...
Lord Seventh.

2969
03:17:47,882 --> 03:17:51,678
To be honest, I wanted to make
this announcement after he won.

2970
03:17:51,970 --> 03:17:52,846
You guys!

2971
03:17:53,638 --> 03:17:55,431
Listen, everyone!

2972
03:17:55,456 --> 03:17:58,334
Boruto used
a Scientific Ninja Tool!

2973
03:17:58,852 --> 03:18:00,395
It was prohibited here...

2974
03:18:00,436 --> 03:18:02,689
But, there is no denying that
this Scientific Ninja Tool

2975
03:18:02,730 --> 03:18:04,983
made it possible for him
to reach this point!

2976
03:18:06,447 --> 03:18:07,573
Katasuke!

2977
03:18:08,119 --> 03:18:11,206
That is why, Five Kage and
everyone from the villages...

2978
03:18:11,558 --> 03:18:13,751
This was the perfect venue to demonstrate
this amazing Scientific Ninja Tool and—

2979
03:18:19,664 --> 03:18:21,916
Get behind me, quick!

2980
03:18:23,582 --> 03:18:25,959
Hey, hey!
What's with you guys?!

2981
03:18:26,004 --> 03:18:27,338
Don't approach them!

2982
03:18:28,214 --> 03:18:30,758
This arena is where
I demonstrate my...

2983
03:18:48,610 --> 03:18:50,361
Our top priority is
to prevent any casualties.

2984
03:19:13,567 --> 03:19:16,403
I can see the fox with
my Byakugan.

2985
03:19:17,221 --> 03:19:19,599
It's dangerous here,
go to where the others are—!

2986
03:19:32,795 --> 03:19:34,881
This child is the last one remaining.

2987
03:19:34,948 --> 03:19:36,574
Take care of her.

2988
03:19:36,616 --> 03:19:38,493
I'm going to check over there.

2989
03:19:40,453 --> 03:19:41,329
Sarada!

2990
03:19:52,590 --> 03:19:53,508
Dad?!

2991
03:19:53,591 --> 03:19:54,968
You don't look like you're hurt.

2992
03:19:57,095 --> 03:19:58,346
This is for last time!

2993
03:20:41,264 --> 03:20:42,724
That was close!

2994
03:20:44,183 --> 03:20:45,727
Boruto! Are you all right?

2995
03:20:45,977 --> 03:20:47,353
Yeah, what about you?

2996
03:20:49,105 --> 03:20:50,356
How trivial.

2997
03:20:55,361 --> 03:20:56,529
It was sucked in?!

2998
03:20:57,155 --> 03:20:58,239
Kinshiki.

2999
03:20:58,698 --> 03:20:59,574
Yes!

3000
03:21:03,453 --> 03:21:05,496
We can't use our powers here.

3001
03:21:05,580 --> 03:21:07,165
We'll end up dragging
everyone into this.

3002
03:21:07,290 --> 03:21:09,542
It seems like I'm their target.

3003
03:21:09,876 --> 03:21:11,044
I'll lure them.

3004
03:21:12,462 --> 03:21:13,671
Looks like it's safe now.

3005
03:21:14,297 --> 03:21:15,298
Hurry and go over there.

3006
03:21:15,548 --> 03:21:16,257
Uh-huh.

3007
03:21:20,689 --> 03:21:22,566
If I use this power here,

3008
03:21:23,264 --> 03:21:25,099
I won't be able to stay here
any longer.

3009
03:21:26,017 --> 03:21:26,851
But...

3010
03:21:27,523 --> 03:21:29,442
At this point,
it doesn't really matter anyway.

3011
03:21:40,323 --> 03:21:43,659
I've never seen chakra
used like that.

3012
03:21:48,331 --> 03:21:49,582
Otsutsuki!

3013
03:21:51,442 --> 03:21:53,027
That's a dangerous power.

3014
03:21:53,269 --> 03:21:55,146
I will not let you use it.

3015
03:22:00,322 --> 03:22:01,741
Boru... to...

3016
03:22:04,021 --> 03:22:05,689
This is amazing.

3017
03:22:05,974 --> 03:22:08,351
Our techniques don't possess
this kind of power...

3018
03:22:09,523 --> 03:22:13,360
The creatures of this planet
are quite amusing.

3019
03:22:22,033 --> 03:22:24,118
Oh, so it's you.

3020
03:22:24,565 --> 03:22:27,317
It seems you're good
at surprising people...

3021
03:22:27,367 --> 03:22:29,995
but not too good at
being taken by surprise.

3022
03:22:30,564 --> 03:22:32,357
Big words coming from you.

3023
03:22:38,131 --> 03:22:41,092
How can he see right through
our attacks?

3024
03:22:45,555 --> 03:22:47,390
I already know...

3025
03:22:47,640 --> 03:22:51,978
You're currently using your weapon,
your sand for search and rescue...

3026
03:22:52,377 --> 03:22:55,464
As for you,
you didn't bring your real weapon.

3027
03:22:56,065 --> 03:22:57,567
What are you trying to say?

3028
03:22:57,817 --> 03:23:00,903
Investigation is my specialty.

3029
03:23:01,154 --> 03:23:03,362
If you were at full strength
that's another matter...

3030
03:23:03,387 --> 03:23:05,348
But as you are now...!

3031
03:23:07,333 --> 03:23:10,154
You see? That happens when
you don't have enough sand.

3032
03:23:11,412 --> 03:23:14,040
I don't fall for the same trick twice!

3033
03:23:15,607 --> 03:23:17,009
My turn!

3034
03:23:18,087 --> 03:23:19,839
This is the Kazekage's—!

3035
03:23:27,471 --> 03:23:28,708
You see?

3036
03:23:28,733 --> 03:23:32,779
Your real weapon wouldn't break...
but with that sword...

3037
03:23:33,436 --> 03:23:35,646
He's certainly underestimated us.

3038
03:23:35,897 --> 03:23:36,814
Yes.

3039
03:23:45,656 --> 03:23:46,991
What?

3040
03:23:47,531 --> 03:23:49,700
You consider power as a mere tool...

3041
03:23:49,903 --> 03:23:52,906
You wouldn't understand with
your borrowed weapons...

3042
03:23:53,331 --> 03:23:56,000
It's strength honed through
long training.

3043
03:23:56,417 --> 03:23:58,920
And it's always dependable,
at any time.

3044
03:23:59,424 --> 03:24:00,425
Oh...?

3045
03:24:00,450 --> 03:24:03,828
Then I'll just have to teach you,
that your assumptions...

3046
03:24:04,175 --> 03:24:05,843
are wrong!

3047
03:24:08,095 --> 03:24:09,847
You're so naïve!

3048
03:24:17,150 --> 03:24:20,612
I got that jutsu earlier
from that boy.

3049
03:24:24,695 --> 03:24:26,739
I can already see through
your moves!

3050
03:24:26,822 --> 03:24:29,728
Your jutsu will no longer
work on me!

3051
03:24:35,777 --> 03:24:37,904
Didn't I already say
you were naïve?

3052
03:24:39,627 --> 03:24:41,587
Are you at your wit's end yet?

3053
03:24:42,630 --> 03:24:45,049
Then I'll end this now!

3054
03:24:46,550 --> 03:24:48,886
<i>Ameno Subaruboshinomikoto!</i>

3055
03:24:56,772 --> 03:24:59,942
Can you guess why I dug into
the earth with my sand?

3056
03:25:00,564 --> 03:25:01,649
<i>This is...!</i>

3057
03:25:02,525 --> 03:25:04,110
<i>An underground reservoir
of groundwater?!</i>

3058
03:25:04,443 --> 03:25:08,864
You can see through all our moves
with your Byakugan.

3059
03:25:09,073 --> 03:25:11,867
So, I just turned an act that looked
meaningless to you...

3060
03:25:11,951 --> 03:25:13,369
into a saturation attack.

3061
03:25:13,619 --> 03:25:15,788
<i>Water Style: Giant Vortex Jutsu!</i>

3062
03:25:32,263 --> 03:25:34,932
You were the naïve one, it seems.

3063
03:25:59,550 --> 03:26:01,135
Who are you?!

3064
03:26:01,995 --> 03:26:04,205
I am Kinshiki Otsutsuki...

3065
03:26:04,426 --> 03:26:06,557
This is Lord Momoshiki Otsutsuki.

3066
03:26:07,256 --> 03:26:08,966
What do you want with me?

3067
03:26:09,008 --> 03:26:11,510
We will turn the scattered chakra
into one fruit,

3068
03:26:11,633 --> 03:26:15,303
and finish what Kaguya failed
to do in this seedbed.

3069
03:26:16,015 --> 03:26:17,308
According to the scroll...

3070
03:26:17,350 --> 03:26:20,144
It was recorded that these guys would
come to steal the fruit of the chakra...

3071
03:26:21,162 --> 03:26:24,165
That's why Kaguya was amassing
an army of White Zetsu...

3072
03:26:24,190 --> 03:26:26,942
First Kaguya, and now this...

3073
03:26:27,693 --> 03:26:29,195
What do they plan to do
with the fruit?

3074
03:26:29,278 --> 03:26:30,946
They plan on making pills.

3075
03:26:31,113 --> 03:26:32,239
Pills?

3076
03:26:32,514 --> 03:26:33,723
Medicine.

3077
03:26:34,021 --> 03:26:36,148
Precisely. As long as we have this,

3078
03:26:36,173 --> 03:26:39,885
we are eternally young,
immortal, and invincible!

3079
03:26:40,556 --> 03:26:42,500
You poor, inferior creatures...

3080
03:26:42,625 --> 03:26:47,650
Unless you train and persevere
senselessly, you get nowhere.

3081
03:26:48,255 --> 03:26:49,548
Watch me!

3082
03:26:49,573 --> 03:26:53,201
With this pill, instantly,
with no effort, and so easily...

3083
03:26:53,226 --> 03:26:55,270
I acquire true power.

3084
03:26:55,388 --> 03:26:56,680
Quit kidding around!

3085
03:26:56,847 --> 03:26:58,808
That's not true power!

3086
03:27:00,226 --> 03:27:03,062
Vulgar creatures like you
wouldn't understand...

3087
03:27:04,551 --> 03:27:05,594
What will you do?

3088
03:27:06,390 --> 03:27:09,810
I didn't want to soil my garments,
but I shall do it anyway.

3089
03:27:10,456 --> 03:27:15,086
I'll have to rearrange this seedbed
and make it beautiful anyway.

3090
03:27:18,353 --> 03:27:21,106
There's also the jutsu I acquired earlier.

3091
03:27:29,839 --> 03:27:30,840
No...

3092
03:28:00,703 --> 03:28:01,912
It's meaningless.

3093
03:28:19,597 --> 03:28:20,848
What is this?

3094
03:28:22,243 --> 03:28:24,162
<i>I didn't know
Dad had power like this...</i>

3095
03:28:31,692 --> 03:28:32,526
Here!

3096
03:28:32,902 --> 03:28:33,694
Here!

3097
03:28:38,908 --> 03:28:42,453
If the real you goes down,
it's all over!

3098
03:28:42,912 --> 03:28:44,497
Thanks, Sasuke.

3099
03:29:02,181 --> 03:29:03,140
Naruto...

3100
03:29:21,617 --> 03:29:23,327
It will all be over after this.

3101
03:29:24,286 --> 03:29:26,539
But you must not die, Fox.

3102
03:29:32,628 --> 03:29:35,256
Sasuke... Take care of them both.

3103
03:29:40,719 --> 03:29:41,679
I got it.

3104
03:29:44,848 --> 03:29:46,308
– Uncle!
– Dad!

3105
03:29:47,476 --> 03:29:49,019
Let's do this, Kurama!

3106
03:29:49,103 --> 03:29:51,021
You'd better not be out of shape!

3107
03:29:51,647 --> 03:29:52,815
<i>Don't be stupid!</i>

3108
03:29:52,898 --> 03:29:54,483
<i>I'm ready to go anytime!</i>

3109
03:29:54,984 --> 03:29:55,734
Right!

3110
03:30:29,518 --> 03:30:30,603
<i>Listen...</i>

3111
03:30:30,686 --> 03:30:33,897
<i>He was full of weaknesses.
He was a good-for-nothing.</i>

3112
03:30:34,648 --> 03:30:36,942
<i>But he pulled himself up
with his own strength...</i>

3113
03:30:37,026 --> 03:30:38,360
<i>and became the Hokage.</i>

3114
03:30:39,320 --> 03:30:42,656
<i>You don't need to understand
who Naruto is now.</i>

3115
03:30:42,823 --> 03:30:45,075
<i>You need to know the Naruto
who made it all the way here.</i>

3116
03:30:50,205 --> 03:30:51,123
Dad!

3117
03:31:01,114 --> 03:31:02,282
You're awake.

3118
03:31:05,638 --> 03:31:06,722
Is this the hospital?

3119
03:31:06,972 --> 03:31:09,892
Everyone's been
transported here.

3120
03:31:10,601 --> 03:31:12,686
Lord Seventh protected us all.

3121
03:31:14,014 --> 03:31:15,015
I see.

3122
03:31:16,378 --> 03:31:17,182
So everyone's safe?

3123
03:31:17,207 --> 03:31:17,874
Mama!

3124
03:31:18,525 --> 03:31:19,443
Himawari?!

3125
03:31:22,041 --> 03:31:22,655
Hinata!

3126
03:31:22,764 --> 03:31:24,432
It's me. Can you hear me?

3127
03:31:25,157 --> 03:31:26,116
Mom!

3128
03:31:26,659 --> 03:31:28,410
It's all right. She'll be okay.

3129
03:31:29,203 --> 03:31:30,621
What happened, Mom?!

3130
03:31:31,747 --> 03:31:33,248
She charged after him.

3131
03:31:33,707 --> 03:31:35,125
Why'd she do something
crazy like that?!

3132
03:31:36,335 --> 03:31:38,003
She tried to get Naruto back...

3133
03:31:42,963 --> 03:31:43,792
Dad...

3134
03:32:03,779 --> 03:32:04,863
Boruto...

3135
03:32:08,617 --> 03:32:09,702
Boruto...

3136
03:33:16,744 --> 03:33:18,412
<i>And when Dad was a kid,</i>

3137
03:33:18,437 --> 03:33:21,523
<i>Grandpa Hokage wasn't even alive!</i>

3138
03:33:22,024 --> 03:33:24,401
<i>So I guess Dad's lucky
he never experienced</i>

3139
03:33:24,443 --> 03:33:27,068
<i>the "joy" of having
a parent around!</i>

3140
03:33:27,863 --> 03:33:29,948
<i>Why does my dad have
to be the Hokage?!</i>

3141
03:33:30,947 --> 03:33:33,866
<i>He just sits at his desk all day
and acts bossy!</i>

3142
03:33:34,077 --> 03:33:35,454
<i>Anyone can do that!</i>

3143
03:34:22,876 --> 03:34:24,294
<i>This is so uncool!</i>

3144
03:34:26,672 --> 03:34:29,341
I'm the one who's... uncool.

3145
03:34:29,591 --> 03:34:31,051
You got that right...

3146
03:34:31,760 --> 03:34:32,761
Sasuke!

3147
03:34:33,220 --> 03:34:34,680
You got caught cheating,

3148
03:34:34,721 --> 03:34:36,348
and everyone scorned you.

3149
03:34:36,831 --> 03:34:38,624
You had your headband taken away,

3150
03:34:38,978 --> 03:34:40,769
and you can't even call yourself
a shinobi right now.

3151
03:34:41,462 --> 03:34:43,630
On top of that, your father is gone.

3152
03:34:44,648 --> 03:34:47,651
You're in the same situation
your dad used to be in.

3153
03:34:48,527 --> 03:34:49,862
But you're lucky.

3154
03:34:49,887 --> 03:34:51,597
You have a sister who adores you

3155
03:34:51,622 --> 03:34:54,333
and a mother who worries
so much about you.

3156
03:34:57,870 --> 03:35:00,747
<i>Maybe instead of the Naruto of today,</i>

3157
03:35:00,881 --> 03:35:02,800
<i>you should study
who Naruto was in the past.</i>

3158
03:35:05,618 --> 03:35:06,578
So...

3159
03:35:09,047 --> 03:35:11,174
what did my dad do
at times like these?

3160
03:35:16,504 --> 03:35:20,717
Seems you want to know more
than just his weaknesses now.

3161
03:35:23,937 --> 03:35:26,356
Well, ask him yourself.

3162
03:35:27,190 --> 03:35:28,191
We're going to rescue him.

3163
03:35:28,859 --> 03:35:30,360
My dad is alive?!

3164
03:35:31,570 --> 03:35:33,447
I can sense his chakra...

3165
03:35:34,072 --> 03:35:38,744
I can't tell if he's hurt or not,
but at the very least, he's not dead.

3166
03:35:41,121 --> 03:35:43,916
If you're going to rescue the Hokage...

3167
03:35:46,793 --> 03:35:49,212
Let us pitch in and help!

3168
03:35:51,173 --> 03:35:54,927
We can't ignore
the Otsutsuki Clan either.

3169
03:35:55,093 --> 03:35:57,846
Standing idly by when our sworn friend
has been kidnapped

3170
03:35:58,001 --> 03:35:59,878
would disgrace the Five Kage's name.

3171
03:36:00,307 --> 03:36:04,686
Let's make them regret ever
making us their enemy.

3172
03:36:07,147 --> 03:36:09,733
What was written in the scroll?

3173
03:36:10,108 --> 03:36:12,669
It warned of pursuers personally
coming to this land

3174
03:36:12,694 --> 03:36:16,990
because Kaguya stopped supplying chakra
to the Otsutsuki Clan.

3175
03:36:17,240 --> 03:36:22,829
And Kaguya was in preparations to attack
once they arrived, more or less.

3176
03:36:23,388 --> 03:36:27,767
So what they're after is
massive amounts of chakra.

3177
03:36:28,543 --> 03:36:30,796
So that's why Eight-Tails was targeted.

3178
03:36:31,046 --> 03:36:37,302
It's clear the Hokage was taken
in order to extract the Nine-Tails.

3179
03:36:38,303 --> 03:36:40,597
But the timing of their attack...

3180
03:36:41,269 --> 03:36:44,313
They ruined the crucial Chunin Exams.

3181
03:36:44,910 --> 03:36:48,205
I was attacked by the one
that sucks up that chakra.

3182
03:36:49,166 --> 03:36:50,668
<i>That's a dangerous power.</i>

3183
03:36:51,012 --> 03:36:53,056
<i>I will not let you use it!</i>

3184
03:36:56,240 --> 03:37:00,119
He steals our jutsu with that fishhook.

3185
03:37:00,450 --> 03:37:02,911
If the Otsutsuki Clan is our enemy...

3186
03:37:03,016 --> 03:37:04,851
Ordinary methods won't work.

3187
03:37:05,998 --> 03:37:07,958
We have to be prepared
for the worst.

3188
03:37:08,489 --> 03:37:11,367
We must never let something that
takes chakra away from people,

3189
03:37:11,718 --> 03:37:14,429
the Divine Tree,
regenerate ever again.

3190
03:37:16,107 --> 03:37:18,151
The one called Kinshiki
possesses the ability

3191
03:37:18,176 --> 03:37:19,970
to use stolen chakra to forge weapons.

3192
03:37:20,220 --> 03:37:23,098
He attacked with ferocious power
and speed.

3193
03:37:23,849 --> 03:37:26,309
The other one called Momoshiki...

3194
03:37:26,779 --> 03:37:31,158
Not only does he absorb his foe's jutsu
with the Rinnegan in his palm,

3195
03:37:31,396 --> 03:37:33,523
he returns it with
an even greater intensity.

3196
03:37:34,686 --> 03:37:39,524
Using any jutsu against Momoshiki
will rebound to you.

3197
03:37:42,725 --> 03:37:44,060
How troublesome...

3198
03:37:45,113 --> 03:37:47,866
We'd better brace ourselves
for this one.

3199
03:37:48,411 --> 03:37:49,996
So, where is Naruto?

3200
03:37:50,535 --> 03:37:53,413
The scroll revealed their whereabouts.

3201
03:37:54,122 --> 03:37:56,208
Naruto is probably there too.

3202
03:37:56,577 --> 03:37:58,537
I've already analyzed it
with my Rinnegan.

3203
03:37:59,169 --> 03:38:00,754
Then shall we go?

3204
03:38:05,247 --> 03:38:06,665
What are you doing, Boruto?

3205
03:38:07,260 --> 03:38:07,886
Huh?

3206
03:38:10,055 --> 03:38:12,140
Do you intend on bringing him?

3207
03:38:12,395 --> 03:38:14,454
Hey, c'mon... you must be kidding!

3208
03:38:14,810 --> 03:38:17,062
Even I think it's too dangerous.

3209
03:38:17,325 --> 03:38:20,620
Yes, I think he should stay home...

3210
03:38:20,756 --> 03:38:22,340
I'm absolutely not joking.

3211
03:38:22,820 --> 03:38:25,614
He is none other than his son.

3212
03:38:26,026 --> 03:38:27,403
And he's my student.

3213
03:38:32,577 --> 03:38:33,495
Maybe...

3214
03:38:33,708 --> 03:38:34,417
I—

3215
03:38:35,051 --> 03:38:36,511
I'm saying it's okay.

3216
03:38:37,624 --> 03:38:39,626
Listen carefully, Boruto.

3217
03:38:41,086 --> 03:38:42,462
Those guys are dangerous.

3218
03:38:42,909 --> 03:38:44,035
But knowing that,

3219
03:38:44,060 --> 03:38:46,813
I'm still taking you for a reason.

3220
03:38:47,250 --> 03:38:47,875
Huh?

3221
03:38:49,052 --> 03:38:52,472
If several of us should fall,
or in the worst case...

3222
03:38:52,497 --> 03:38:54,916
if we're all driven into a corner...

3223
03:38:58,054 --> 03:38:59,764
If that time comes,
you must take over.

3224
03:39:00,939 --> 03:39:02,858
That's why I'm taking you.

3225
03:39:04,317 --> 03:39:05,944
If even you say that...

3226
03:39:07,237 --> 03:39:09,489
You're actually a strong shinobi.

3227
03:39:10,031 --> 03:39:13,535
I lost to him,
but if you put your mind to it,

3228
03:39:13,617 --> 03:39:15,660
you can become the shinobi
who can defeat him.

3229
03:39:16,402 --> 03:39:17,403
I can't!

3230
03:39:18,039 --> 03:39:18,999
You definitely can.

3231
03:39:19,374 --> 03:39:19,916
Huh?

3232
03:39:20,584 --> 03:39:24,212
Because you're a bigger loser
than Naruto ever was.

3233
03:39:24,887 --> 03:39:27,473
A loser? What does—?

3234
03:39:27,498 --> 03:39:29,208
I mean that you hate to lose.

3235
03:39:30,319 --> 03:39:31,987
I'm saying you can do it.

3236
03:39:32,387 --> 03:39:33,889
Trust my words.

3237
03:39:36,600 --> 03:39:38,059
I'll go.

3238
03:39:38,646 --> 03:39:39,438
All right.

3239
03:39:39,686 --> 03:39:42,188
But before that,
I have something to give you.

3240
03:39:46,693 --> 03:39:48,528
Isn't this yours?

3241
03:39:50,280 --> 03:39:52,699
I threw it away long ago,

3242
03:39:53,385 --> 03:39:56,722
but your father kept it safe
for me all this time.

3243
03:39:57,466 --> 03:39:59,217
We made a promise then.

3244
03:40:00,081 --> 03:40:02,876
That I would keep it until the day
we could have a real fight.

3245
03:40:04,082 --> 03:40:05,417
I'm giving it to you.

3246
03:40:38,310 --> 03:40:39,352
All right, let's go!

3247
03:40:48,046 --> 03:40:49,047
Dad...

3248
03:40:49,662 --> 03:40:50,413
Take me too!

3249
03:40:50,715 --> 03:40:51,549
Sarada...

3250
03:40:52,074 --> 03:40:54,952
You're the only one in the village
who possesses the Sharingan.

3251
03:40:55,470 --> 03:40:58,181
Stay with Kakashi and Shikamaru
and protect this place.

3252
03:41:00,549 --> 03:41:01,466
I got it.

3253
03:41:01,810 --> 03:41:03,311
Be careful, Dad.

3254
03:41:03,770 --> 03:41:05,146
You better come back.

3255
03:41:05,605 --> 03:41:06,523
Of course.

3256
03:41:06,815 --> 03:41:08,233
Leave everything here to us.

3257
03:41:08,942 --> 03:41:11,277
Bring Naruto back home.

3258
03:41:19,369 --> 03:41:21,079
Shikadai... I...

3259
03:41:21,386 --> 03:41:24,473
You've got something right now
that you need to do.

3260
03:41:25,633 --> 03:41:27,468
Explanations are a drag.

3261
03:41:28,044 --> 03:41:29,295
Get it done!

3262
03:41:29,567 --> 03:41:31,694
I'll listen to what you have to say
when you get back.

3263
03:41:34,538 --> 03:41:35,330
Okay!

3264
03:41:39,014 --> 03:41:41,516
We'll use this to get to them.

3265
03:41:49,774 --> 03:41:51,526
– Boruto!
– Big Brother!

3266
03:41:53,361 --> 03:41:54,237
Mom!

3267
03:41:57,490 --> 03:41:58,324
Boruto...

3268
03:42:11,421 --> 03:42:13,423
Naruto...

3269
03:42:14,007 --> 03:42:15,300
I'm going to go now.

3270
03:42:25,393 --> 03:42:28,813
I leave your father
in your hands, Boruto!

3271
03:42:29,147 --> 03:42:29,939
Yeah!

3272
03:42:30,565 --> 03:42:32,609
You're finally acting like a shinobi.

3273
03:42:33,276 --> 03:42:33,902
Let's go!

3274
03:42:34,611 --> 03:42:37,280
Sarada, Shikadai...
Take care of everyone!

3275
03:43:07,035 --> 03:43:11,999
How does it feel to be nourishing
this seedbed that I created?

3276
03:43:12,583 --> 03:43:14,126
It's nice, isn't it?

3277
03:43:14,646 --> 03:43:17,729
That Divine Tree was created
from one like you,

3278
03:43:17,754 --> 03:43:20,424
who harbored a beast.

3279
03:43:21,425 --> 03:43:22,718
<i>Old Man Bee...!</i>

3280
03:43:25,471 --> 03:43:29,183
In a short while,
you'll become a Divine Tree too....

3281
03:43:32,102 --> 03:43:34,605
What a ridiculous amount of chakra.

3282
03:43:34,752 --> 03:43:37,255
We've finally just reached
the halfway point.

3283
03:43:44,951 --> 03:43:46,202
It's taking too long.

3284
03:43:48,427 --> 03:43:49,762
Sorry about that.

3285
03:43:51,205 --> 03:43:58,587
You see, we ninja don't like
to make things easy, ya know?

3286
03:44:01,273 --> 03:44:02,399
Let's go!

3287
03:44:09,181 --> 03:44:10,349
These guys?!

3288
03:44:10,849 --> 03:44:13,227
<i>It's the man in the black cape
with the Rinnegan!</i>

3289
03:44:15,938 --> 03:44:16,980
Dad!

3290
03:44:26,521 --> 03:44:29,274
Don't think that you can escape from us.

3291
03:44:30,386 --> 03:44:32,471
Stop babbling, you vulgar creatures!

3292
03:44:32,829 --> 03:44:33,747
Let's do this!

3293
03:44:39,378 --> 03:44:41,046
Are you okay, Dad?

3294
03:44:41,588 --> 03:44:42,464
Boruto!

3295
03:44:42,747 --> 03:44:44,040
What are you doing here?

3296
03:44:45,717 --> 03:44:47,469
Your clothes...

3297
03:44:50,264 --> 03:44:51,765
A lot has happened...

3298
03:44:53,016 --> 03:44:55,852
In short, he's become a ninja.

3299
03:45:00,952 --> 03:45:03,830
I feel like I'm looking at
my own Shadow Clone.

3300
03:45:04,190 --> 03:45:07,114
Do I look at least a little cooler?

3301
03:45:08,448 --> 03:45:10,284
Yeah, more than before.

3302
03:45:14,663 --> 03:45:18,250
So, you were paying
a little attention to me before?

3303
03:45:24,548 --> 03:45:28,802
Boruto... I'm sorry for
everything up until now.

3304
03:45:31,013 --> 03:45:35,142
By trying to protect you
and everyone in the village...

3305
03:45:35,302 --> 03:45:37,263
I ended up ignoring my family...

3306
03:45:38,312 --> 03:45:40,689
And I didn't even try to understand you.

3307
03:45:41,567 --> 03:45:42,401
Dad...

3308
03:45:43,066 --> 03:45:44,651
When I was a kid...

3309
03:45:44,944 --> 03:45:47,779
I wanted attention too,
and kept pulling pranks.

3310
03:45:48,655 --> 03:45:52,117
I'm the last guy who has
the right to lecture you.

3311
03:45:52,576 --> 03:45:54,536
You used to... pull pranks?

3312
03:45:54,784 --> 03:45:55,451
Huh?

3313
03:45:55,746 --> 03:45:56,747
Oh yeah...

3314
03:45:56,872 --> 03:46:00,792
I also painted words like "stupid" and
"idiot" on the Great Stone Faces...

3315
03:46:00,876 --> 03:46:03,211
and Iruka-sensei yelled at me a lot.

3316
03:46:03,712 --> 03:46:04,796
No kidding...

3317
03:46:10,094 --> 03:46:14,473
Y'know, I don't know anything
about you, Dad.

3318
03:46:15,175 --> 03:46:15,880
Boruto...

3319
03:46:16,850 --> 03:46:18,185
No, that's not it...

3320
03:46:20,020 --> 03:46:22,606
Actually... I wanted to know
all the time.

3321
03:46:24,191 --> 03:46:26,652
But my pride held me back...

3322
03:46:27,486 --> 03:46:32,032
and I didn't try to see your side...
and kept pushing back at you...

3323
03:46:33,867 --> 03:46:36,244
But now... I want to know.

3324
03:46:38,413 --> 03:46:39,331
So...

3325
03:46:40,165 --> 03:46:41,291
It's fine the way it's been.

3326
03:46:42,838 --> 03:46:43,548
Yeah...

3327
03:46:44,461 --> 03:46:46,213
It's okay to keep things
just as they were...

3328
03:46:47,881 --> 03:46:48,882
Just...

3329
03:46:50,506 --> 03:46:52,758
When you have time,
instead of lecturing me...

3330
03:46:53,512 --> 03:46:56,139
I want you to tell me
stories from your past.

3331
03:47:01,645 --> 03:47:02,562
Okay.

3332
03:47:03,480 --> 03:47:05,691
But are you sure about that?

3333
03:47:05,982 --> 03:47:06,608
Huh?

3334
03:47:06,971 --> 03:47:10,225
It's a really long story!

3335
03:47:12,406 --> 03:47:15,158
All right,
if we're going to protect everyone...

3336
03:47:15,183 --> 03:47:16,392
We'd better get going.

3337
03:47:22,582 --> 03:47:24,584
Protect everyone, huh?

3338
03:47:25,085 --> 03:47:25,794
Hmm?

3339
03:47:26,253 --> 03:47:27,212
Oh, nothing...

3340
03:47:27,337 --> 03:47:30,882
You always say you have to
protect everyone in the village...

3341
03:47:31,586 --> 03:47:34,339
You really mean it, don't you?

3342
03:47:35,725 --> 03:47:37,184
Of course, ya know!

3343
03:47:38,682 --> 03:47:42,269
I never go back on my word.

3344
03:48:00,829 --> 03:48:04,499
Because that's my... ninja way!

3345
03:48:07,502 --> 03:48:10,589
All right, let's go!

3346
03:48:11,423 --> 03:48:14,092
Yeah... Let's do this!

3347
03:48:31,610 --> 03:48:34,196
You're quite nimble
and fast for your size.

3348
03:48:35,491 --> 03:48:40,830
I'll soon make you regret your insolence,
you inferior creature!

3349
03:48:44,623 --> 03:48:46,208
You're wide open!

3350
03:48:46,291 --> 03:48:47,793
As are you!

3351
03:48:54,257 --> 03:48:56,134
Why you impudent—!

3352
03:48:58,913 --> 03:48:59,830
<i>Chidori!</i>

3353
03:49:06,436 --> 03:49:08,897
<i>Bloody Mist Sword Art:
Bone Mutilation!</i>

3354
03:49:08,939 --> 03:49:09,940
Tsuchikage!

3355
03:49:10,190 --> 03:49:11,233
Leave it to me!

3356
03:49:12,108 --> 03:49:12,900
<i>Lava Style:</i>

3357
03:49:12,925 --> 03:49:14,427
<i>Ash Stone Sealing Jutsu!</i>

3358
03:49:22,452 --> 03:49:24,079
Leave this one to us!

3359
03:49:24,538 --> 03:49:26,122
You go for the other one!

3360
03:49:28,959 --> 03:49:32,879
Attacking when the Five Kage
were all assembled...

3361
03:49:33,102 --> 03:49:34,906
You guys have such bad luck...

3362
03:49:48,875 --> 03:49:50,210
Sorry we're late!

3363
03:49:50,711 --> 03:49:51,670
Dad, wait!

3364
03:49:52,754 --> 03:49:54,130
What is it, Boruto?

3365
03:49:54,506 --> 03:49:56,550
You can't use ninjutsu on him!

3366
03:50:00,011 --> 03:50:05,392
He absorbed every jutsu I threw at him
when I used the Scientific Ninja Tool.

3367
03:50:05,976 --> 03:50:08,318
And he magnified the
intensity of those jutsu

3368
03:50:08,342 --> 03:50:10,689
many times over and
threw it back at us.

3369
03:50:15,193 --> 03:50:16,319
What a pain.

3370
03:50:20,699 --> 03:50:22,617
Simply put...

3371
03:50:22,680 --> 03:50:26,475
You absorb jutsu, then release it... right?

3372
03:50:26,788 --> 03:50:31,084
But once your ammo is used up,
the jutsu is useless.

3373
03:50:32,085 --> 03:50:35,213
Just like the Scientific
Ninja Team's toys...

3374
03:50:35,672 --> 03:50:37,716
Then that makes things easy.

3375
03:50:37,788 --> 03:50:41,751
We'll proceed without jutsu,
and take you down with brute force.

3376
03:50:42,387 --> 03:50:43,513
Although that's kinda dull.

3377
03:50:53,557 --> 03:50:55,567
Your partner is already done...

3378
03:50:56,199 --> 03:50:57,517
Surrender.

3379
03:51:02,032 --> 03:51:05,076
Is that your child, Fox?

3380
03:51:07,078 --> 03:51:08,872
What a pity, Fox...

3381
03:51:09,581 --> 03:51:11,875
That you possess so much power,

3382
03:51:11,916 --> 03:51:15,462
yet not the means to pass it down
to the next generation...

3383
03:51:15,962 --> 03:51:18,590
You bastard, what the hell
are you talking about?!

3384
03:51:18,761 --> 03:51:20,179
Get back, Boruto!

3385
03:51:22,469 --> 03:51:23,970
Let me show you...

3386
03:51:24,012 --> 03:51:26,473
how my clan does things!

3387
03:51:34,439 --> 03:51:35,440
No way!

3388
03:51:35,815 --> 03:51:38,318
Now, Lord Momoshiki!

3389
03:51:38,485 --> 03:51:41,613
It seems the time has come
for you to consume my chakra...

3390
03:51:41,971 --> 03:51:45,683
The same way that my guardian
entrusted me with their power!

3391
03:51:46,034 --> 03:51:47,994
Do not waver!

3392
03:51:48,203 --> 03:51:49,412
Of course!

3393
03:52:00,924 --> 03:52:01,716
Damn it!

3394
03:52:02,634 --> 03:52:03,593
<i>This is bad.</i>

3395
03:52:07,430 --> 03:52:08,890
It's too late.

3396
03:52:34,082 --> 03:52:36,376
Your own brethren...

3397
03:52:36,624 --> 03:52:38,585
H-He ate him!

3398
03:52:39,043 --> 03:52:40,253
That fiend!

3399
03:52:40,422 --> 03:52:44,384
It was Kinshiki's wish to
be useful to me.

3400
03:52:44,551 --> 03:52:46,511
The transfer of power...

3401
03:52:46,712 --> 03:52:49,901
is the law of our clan!

3402
03:52:55,161 --> 03:52:57,580
This playtime has gone on too long.

3403
03:52:58,189 --> 03:53:01,860
Well then...
How about we end this now?

3404
03:53:02,819 --> 03:53:06,239
You fools who dare defy a god!

3405
03:53:08,533 --> 03:53:09,659
Not good!

3406
03:53:33,600 --> 03:53:34,517
He's fast!

3407
03:53:41,900 --> 03:53:43,026
Humph...

3408
03:53:45,653 --> 03:53:46,988
<i>Sand—!</i>

3409
03:54:01,044 --> 03:54:02,212
Lord Kazekage!

3410
03:54:17,519 --> 03:54:20,021
<i>He knocked out all of the Five Kage,
in that instant?!</i>

3411
03:54:20,355 --> 03:54:22,148
<i>This is really bad!</i>

3412
03:54:26,719 --> 03:54:29,096
You're next, Fox...

3413
03:54:34,410 --> 03:54:35,328
Boruto...

3414
03:54:35,578 --> 03:54:36,621
Here you are!

3415
03:54:41,835 --> 03:54:42,752
Oh?

3416
03:54:55,473 --> 03:54:56,599
<i>Chakra points?</i>

3417
03:54:56,766 --> 03:54:58,393
That's not the only thing.

3418
03:55:22,500 --> 03:55:23,459
<i>Dad!</i>

3419
03:55:26,796 --> 03:55:28,256
I see.

3420
03:55:28,908 --> 03:55:31,661
So, you're completely different from
what you were a moment ago.

3421
03:55:32,176 --> 03:55:34,387
Nah, rather...

3422
03:55:34,412 --> 03:55:36,414
You're just a monster.

3423
03:55:36,491 --> 03:55:37,658
Oh please...

3424
03:55:37,790 --> 03:55:40,209
We're both monsters.

3425
03:55:43,146 --> 03:55:44,230
<i>Dad...</i>

3426
03:55:44,791 --> 03:55:48,169
Dad!

3427
03:55:54,991 --> 03:55:57,285
This is getting fun.

3428
03:55:57,827 --> 03:56:01,539
Let's teach him, Sasuke!

3429
03:56:02,248 --> 03:56:03,207
Yeah!

3430
03:56:10,423 --> 03:56:11,049
Come!

3431
03:56:26,856 --> 03:56:28,107
Why you—!

3432
03:57:00,098 --> 03:57:01,557
Here we go, Naruto!

3433
03:57:01,724 --> 03:57:02,475
Yeah!

3434
03:57:43,224 --> 03:57:43,975
What?!

3435
03:57:53,068 --> 03:57:54,861
<i>Planetary Devastation!</i>

3436
03:58:14,213 --> 03:58:17,383
<i>Inukai Takeru no Mikoto!</i>

3437
03:58:23,890 --> 03:58:25,725
Damn it!

3438
03:58:33,900 --> 03:58:34,692
Sasuke!

3439
03:58:37,445 --> 03:58:38,863
Die!

3440
03:58:52,126 --> 03:58:54,212
Are you okay, Sasuke?

3441
03:58:55,671 --> 03:58:57,298
Yeah, I'm fine.

3442
03:58:58,299 --> 03:59:01,594
There you are...
Nine-Tailed Fox Demon...

3443
03:59:02,220 --> 03:59:04,138
His power...

3444
03:59:04,163 --> 03:59:05,956
<i>shall be mine!</i>

3445
03:59:07,308 --> 03:59:08,851
I won't let you!

3446
03:59:21,823 --> 03:59:23,991
I'll lend you the power
of the Susano'o.

3447
03:59:24,016 --> 03:59:24,735
Do it!

3448
03:59:24,760 --> 03:59:27,054
I get it...
That's a good idea!

3449
03:59:37,839 --> 03:59:40,633
<i>You inferior creatures!</i>

3450
03:59:56,274 --> 03:59:57,483
Amazing...

3451
04:00:03,447 --> 04:00:05,867
Hey, Hokage...
Did you get him?

3452
04:00:05,950 --> 04:00:08,578
No... It's not over yet.

3453
04:00:09,360 --> 04:00:11,487
Ugh, he's so stubborn.

3454
04:00:11,899 --> 04:00:14,683
Let's finish him with some flashy jutsu
and get it over with.

3455
04:00:14,789 --> 04:00:17,541
Please don't say
such reckless things!

3456
04:00:17,795 --> 04:00:21,257
If he absorbs our chakra again,
we'll be back to square one.

3457
04:00:21,591 --> 04:00:22,675
Yeah, yeah...

3458
04:00:24,093 --> 04:00:26,095
Looks like everyone's okay.

3459
04:00:36,272 --> 04:00:38,741
All right!
Somehow, we made it in time!

3460
04:00:40,193 --> 04:00:41,277
Katasuke!

3461
04:00:41,572 --> 04:00:43,039
How did they—?!

3462
04:00:43,082 --> 04:00:45,459
They must have snuck in with us!

3463
04:00:48,784 --> 04:00:52,502
Make sure you record the power
of this Scientific Ninja Tool!

3464
04:00:52,527 --> 04:00:53,257
Yes!

3465
04:00:53,598 --> 04:00:56,575
I'll finish you off with
my Scientific Ninja Tool!

3466
04:00:56,834 --> 04:00:57,919
You idiot, stop!

3467
04:00:58,189 --> 04:01:00,605
Old Man Katasuke!
Don't use that!

3468
04:01:00,796 --> 04:01:02,298
Take this!

3469
04:01:11,515 --> 04:01:14,769
Damn it, now you've done it,
you bastard.

3470
04:01:17,146 --> 04:01:20,066
Did he just absorb the chakra?

3471
04:01:27,323 --> 04:01:28,824
I see...

3472
04:01:29,200 --> 04:01:32,328
That thing is just like our pills.

3473
04:01:32,870 --> 04:01:35,081
Although it's much more crude
and inferior.

3474
04:01:35,122 --> 04:01:38,729
Still, you have my gratitude,
you fools!

3475
04:02:03,067 --> 04:02:05,695
<i>This is Shikamaru's
Shadow Paralysis!</i>

3476
04:02:07,280 --> 04:02:10,116
Isn't this the Nara Clan's?!

3477
04:02:10,283 --> 04:02:11,826
I can't move!

3478
04:02:15,454 --> 04:02:16,580
Naruto!

3479
04:02:16,831 --> 04:02:17,999
This is bad!

3480
04:02:19,792 --> 04:02:22,503
I'm putting extra effort into you.

3481
04:02:24,463 --> 04:02:25,840
Damn it...

3482
04:02:25,865 --> 04:02:27,700
This isn't looking too good.

3483
04:02:28,467 --> 04:02:30,261
That's right.

3484
04:02:30,286 --> 04:02:32,413
You get it. Now die!

3485
04:02:36,164 --> 04:02:38,458
<i>Damn it...
What do I—?!</i>

3486
04:02:40,271 --> 04:02:41,272
<i>Boruto...</i>

3487
04:02:43,899 --> 04:02:45,735
<i>What's your ninja way?</i>

3488
04:02:45,860 --> 04:02:47,069
<i>Ninja way?</i>

3489
04:02:47,903 --> 04:02:49,530
<i>I never really thought about it.</i>

3490
04:02:49,743 --> 04:02:51,203
<i>It's so old-fashioned,</i>

3491
04:02:51,291 --> 04:02:53,585
<i>and I figure it all depends
on your feelings.</i>

3492
04:02:54,118 --> 04:02:55,077
<i>I see...</i>

3493
04:02:55,911 --> 04:02:58,497
<i>And you're right.
It may be old-fashioned,</i>

3494
04:02:58,581 --> 04:03:04,545
<i>but during this battle,
and in the battles to come,</i>

3495
04:03:04,974 --> 04:03:07,352
<i>you'll be confronted with it
time and time again.</i>

3496
04:03:09,258 --> 04:03:11,635
<i>I don't really understand...</i>

3497
04:03:12,094 --> 04:03:14,138
<i>You'll understand
when the time comes.</i>

3498
04:03:14,450 --> 04:03:16,494
<i>You'll need to do it, Boruto.</i>

3499
04:03:18,351 --> 04:03:20,311
<i>I'm saying you can do it.</i>

3500
04:03:20,394 --> 04:03:22,104
<i>Trust my words.</i>

3501
04:03:23,397 --> 04:03:25,024
<i>I'll do it...</i>

3502
04:03:25,499 --> 04:03:27,084
I can't wimp out now!

3503
04:03:27,402 --> 04:03:31,031
I have to trust my teacher... Sasuke...

3504
04:03:31,594 --> 04:03:33,282
who believed in me!

3505
04:03:35,368 --> 04:03:36,911
Now, Boruto!

3506
04:03:39,705 --> 04:03:41,707
I just have to do this!

3507
04:03:41,916 --> 04:03:44,585
Rasengan?!
When did he learn that?!

3508
04:03:46,295 --> 04:03:48,297
Go!

3509
04:03:50,591 --> 04:03:53,219
You should've just stayed
out of sight.

3510
04:04:00,442 --> 04:04:03,028
What? It's not going to reach?

3511
04:04:05,157 --> 04:04:09,119
What a joke.
It didn't even get close to me!

3512
04:04:09,568 --> 04:04:11,821
Well, don't worry.

3513
04:04:12,119 --> 04:04:15,122
You are all going
to the same place—

3514
04:04:17,743 --> 04:04:18,994
The Shadow Paralysis...

3515
04:04:19,019 --> 04:04:19,853
is undone!

3516
04:04:19,934 --> 04:04:20,810
Dad!

3517
04:04:21,122 --> 04:04:23,582
Boruto! When did you—?

3518
04:04:26,043 --> 04:04:28,425
I told him I'd only accept him
as my pupil

3519
04:04:28,450 --> 04:04:31,494
if he mastered the Rasengan.

3520
04:04:32,358 --> 04:04:35,652
And he managed to do it
in just a few days' time.

3521
04:04:37,132 --> 04:04:39,143
He applied his forte,
the Lightning Style,

3522
04:04:39,168 --> 04:04:42,546
and unconsciously changed
its chakra nature, creating a new jutsu...

3523
04:04:43,087 --> 04:04:45,020
a Vanishing Rasengan.

3524
04:04:47,148 --> 04:04:49,275
A Vanishing Rasengan?

3525
04:04:49,358 --> 04:04:50,734
A jutsu like that?

3526
04:04:50,943 --> 04:04:53,696
I did that? Sasuke?!

3527
04:04:58,325 --> 04:05:00,035
You cheeky brat!

3528
04:05:01,098 --> 04:05:04,601
I don't even know how I did it, though...

3529
04:05:05,207 --> 04:05:07,126
Still, the results were great.

3530
04:05:07,418 --> 04:05:09,170
Good job, Boruto.

3531
04:05:09,253 --> 04:05:11,672
Wh-What...

3532
04:05:11,697 --> 04:05:13,192
As if that will—!

3533
04:05:15,718 --> 04:05:17,270
Momoshiki Otsutsuki...

3534
04:05:17,883 --> 04:05:20,201
At first, you look invincible...

3535
04:05:20,598 --> 04:05:23,726
But it seems that you can't take jutsu
that you can't see.

3536
04:05:26,131 --> 04:05:28,817
Don't misunderstand,
you garbage...

3537
04:05:28,909 --> 04:05:31,370
So what if I cannot see it?

3538
04:05:32,124 --> 04:05:34,876
As long as I have these...
I can continue!

3539
04:05:39,283 --> 04:05:42,161
He was hiding more pills!

3540
04:05:42,239 --> 04:05:45,367
The bastard intends to finish us
with his next attack.

3541
04:05:47,708 --> 04:05:49,960
Boruto, you ready for
another Rasengan?

3542
04:05:51,186 --> 04:05:53,981
But Dad, I'm not strong enough to...

3543
04:05:54,381 --> 04:05:55,758
It's all right.

3544
04:06:38,509 --> 04:06:40,094
<i>It's so heavy!</i>

3545
04:06:40,261 --> 04:06:41,971
<i>So, this is Dad's...</i>

3546
04:06:43,097 --> 04:06:44,723
<i>This weight...</i>

3547
04:06:46,016 --> 04:06:49,353
<i>What did it take to get it this big?</i>

3548
04:06:53,899 --> 04:06:55,526
I don't feel like losing today!

3549
04:06:57,319 --> 04:06:59,321
I see you.
There won't be a second time.

3550
04:07:00,114 --> 04:07:03,867
You probably know this, but...
we've only got one chance.

3551
04:07:03,951 --> 04:07:05,244
– Let's go!
– Right!

3552
04:07:17,548 --> 04:07:19,550
Such trivial moves!

3553
04:07:32,313 --> 04:07:33,397
Damn you!

3554
04:07:38,861 --> 04:07:40,821
The rest is up to you now...

3555
04:07:41,030 --> 04:07:42,364
Boruto!

3556
04:07:46,129 --> 04:07:49,132
Such impudence!
Well, too bad for you!

3557
04:07:49,455 --> 04:07:51,123
I don't know about that!

3558
04:07:56,712 --> 04:07:57,796
Are you the real one?

3559
04:08:06,805 --> 04:08:07,723
I'm...

3560
04:08:07,848 --> 04:08:09,183
over here!

3561
04:08:13,437 --> 04:08:15,022
Do it, Boruto!

3562
04:08:15,272 --> 04:08:16,649
<i>Rasengan!</i>

3563
04:08:20,069 --> 04:08:22,363
Yeah, that was very close.

3564
04:08:22,488 --> 04:08:25,658
Like I said,
there won't be a second time!

3565
04:08:25,783 --> 04:08:27,701
I'm not done yet!

3566
04:08:34,208 --> 04:08:38,379
This is nothing!
I am Momoshiki Otsutsuki!

3567
04:08:59,066 --> 04:09:00,275
Boruto!

3568
04:09:14,540 --> 04:09:16,917
He actually did it!

3569
04:09:19,086 --> 04:09:20,212
Magnificent.

3570
04:09:28,548 --> 04:09:30,216
O-Oww!

3571
04:09:31,705 --> 04:09:33,916
Did I do it?

3572
04:09:42,049 --> 04:09:43,967
It ended up like
I told you before, huh?

3573
04:09:45,622 --> 04:09:50,168
Even if times change,
the soul of a shinobi never changes.

3574
04:09:50,974 --> 04:09:51,975
You're right.

3575
04:09:53,268 --> 04:09:55,646
He's just like you.

3576
04:09:57,356 --> 04:09:58,315
No kidding!

3577
04:09:59,316 --> 04:10:01,819
I told you so, loser.

3578
04:10:04,771 --> 04:10:06,240
You don't look so good.

3579
04:10:06,782 --> 04:10:08,117
Neither do you.

3580
04:10:08,283 --> 04:10:10,244
Don't lump me in with you...

3581
04:10:10,269 --> 04:10:12,605
I'm still able to stand
on my own two feet.

3582
04:10:17,000 --> 04:10:19,962
I win... this match.

3583
04:10:20,697 --> 04:10:22,699
Looks like it.

3584
04:10:22,840 --> 04:10:28,346
So counting all the matches until today,
let's call it even.

3585
04:10:50,367 --> 04:10:51,743
Yeah, that's right.

3586
04:10:52,453 --> 04:10:55,414
I'm the son of Naruto Uzumaki...

3587
04:10:55,622 --> 04:10:57,332
Boruto Uzumaki!

3588
04:11:20,063 --> 04:11:21,106
Thank goodness!

3589
04:11:22,357 --> 04:11:23,066
Yeah.

3590
04:11:24,276 --> 04:11:25,527
Thank you, Boruto!

3591
04:11:25,569 --> 04:11:27,196
Stop, Mom!

3592
04:11:27,237 --> 04:11:27,738
Daddy!

3593
04:11:27,779 --> 04:11:28,405
Oh!

3594
04:11:30,741 --> 04:11:31,867
– Welcome back, Dad!
– Welcome back.

3595
04:11:35,329 --> 04:11:36,747
Are you okay, Big Brother?

3596
04:11:37,539 --> 04:11:38,832
Oh, this is nothing!

3597
04:11:44,087 --> 04:11:47,007
<i>The attack by the gang calling
themselves the Otsutsuki Clan</i>

3598
04:11:47,167 --> 04:11:49,085
<i>caused a lot of damage
in the village...</i>

3599
04:11:49,615 --> 04:11:51,909
<i>and resulted in the cancellation
of the Chunin Exams.</i>

3600
04:11:52,930 --> 04:11:54,974
<i>It was officially reported that
the Five Kage joined forces</i>

3601
04:11:54,999 --> 04:11:57,335
<i>and put an end to the incident,</i>

3602
04:11:57,935 --> 04:12:01,313
<i>and things began to return
to normal in the village.</i>

3603
04:12:02,503 --> 04:12:06,466
<i>Dad also went back to
his hectic daily schedule.</i>

3604
04:12:07,143 --> 04:12:09,061
<i>Being the Hokage is really hard.</i>

3605
04:12:12,574 --> 04:12:13,742
<i>And as for me...</i>

3606
04:12:38,642 --> 04:12:39,935
– Shikadai—!
– I'm sorry!

3607
04:12:40,718 --> 04:12:41,302
Huh?

3608
04:12:41,728 --> 04:12:43,897
Why are you apologizing?

3609
04:12:44,184 --> 04:12:44,768
I mean...

3610
04:12:45,158 --> 04:12:47,285
I told you I'd hear you out,

3611
04:12:47,494 --> 04:12:49,621
but I've been so busy
and made you wait.

3612
04:12:50,244 --> 04:12:52,309
That doesn't matter
at a time like this.

3613
04:12:52,656 --> 04:12:53,657
Sure it does.

3614
04:12:54,074 --> 04:12:56,285
I'm the one saying sorry now!

3615
04:12:56,493 --> 04:12:57,995
No, I'm apologizing too!

3616
04:13:02,916 --> 04:13:04,293
Hey, Shikadai!

3617
04:13:04,334 --> 04:13:05,502
Don't laugh at me.

3618
04:13:05,527 --> 04:13:07,403
You're so slow.
You only noticed now?

3619
04:13:07,745 --> 04:13:08,329
Shut up!

3620
04:13:20,475 --> 04:13:22,394
Anyway, in the end,

3621
04:13:22,436 --> 04:13:25,230
you had to take on
a lot of stuff all alone...

3622
04:13:26,148 --> 04:13:27,858
So, let me apologize for that.

3623
04:13:31,236 --> 04:13:32,029
I'm sorry.

3624
04:13:32,988 --> 04:13:34,782
I said, don't apologize first.

3625
04:13:35,241 --> 04:13:36,617
Oh, right.

3626
04:13:37,451 --> 04:13:38,244
Anyway...

3627
04:13:39,325 --> 04:13:40,493
I feel bad I cheated...

3628
04:13:40,954 --> 04:13:41,496
I'm sorry.

3629
04:13:42,080 --> 04:13:42,664
All right!

3630
04:13:46,566 --> 04:13:49,569
Well? How was the power
of the Five Kage?

3631
04:13:50,380 --> 04:13:52,132
They were strong, like monsters!

3632
04:13:53,133 --> 04:13:54,801
Especially my dad!

3633
04:13:57,748 --> 04:14:00,251
S-Still, I haven't lost to him yet!

3634
04:14:01,097 --> 04:14:04,100
I swear I'm going to become
a greater shinobi than my dad.

3635
04:14:07,356 --> 04:14:08,440
Hey, Boruto...

3636
04:14:09,032 --> 04:14:11,784
Do you remember
all the faces of the guys

3637
04:14:11,809 --> 04:14:12,977
who took part in
the Chunin Exams?

3638
04:14:13,289 --> 04:14:13,790
Huh?

3639
04:14:14,067 --> 04:14:16,278
You remember what kinda guys
were there?

3640
04:14:16,657 --> 04:14:18,325
That's easy.

3641
04:14:18,895 --> 04:14:20,438
Shinki used the Iron Sand and...

3642
04:14:20,827 --> 04:14:21,912
And the others were...

3643
04:14:22,920 --> 04:14:23,588
Hold on...

3644
04:14:25,222 --> 04:14:27,057
You weren't watching them
at all!

3645
04:14:28,043 --> 04:14:30,170
There were lots of amazing guys,
you know.

3646
04:14:31,046 --> 04:14:33,465
If you keep looking up,
they'll end up getting a leg up on you.

3647
04:14:33,840 --> 04:14:35,050
What's that supposed to mean?

3648
04:14:35,300 --> 04:14:38,178
It means I didn't like losing
to you either.

3649
04:14:40,430 --> 04:14:43,517
I've decided to be a shinobi
on my own terms.

3650
04:14:44,726 --> 04:14:48,313
What my parents or
the Nara Clan say won't affect me.

3651
04:14:49,231 --> 04:14:50,732
I'm the same way.

3652
04:14:52,442 --> 04:14:55,278
We said we wouldn't follow
our parents' footsteps...

3653
04:14:58,156 --> 04:15:00,534
But we've been following them
without realizing it.

3654
04:15:05,664 --> 04:15:09,918
That's why I'm going to go farther
than my dad ever imagined!

3655
04:15:10,085 --> 04:15:12,129
There you go talking big again!

3656
04:15:12,963 --> 04:15:15,424
But before that,
I'm going to beat you!

3657
04:15:16,258 --> 04:15:19,594
Even if you use that
Scientific Ninja Tool again.

3658
04:15:20,303 --> 04:15:22,264
I'm never using
that thing again, ya know!

3659
04:15:32,457 --> 04:15:33,083
Boruto!

3660
04:15:35,842 --> 04:15:36,343
Oh!

3661
04:15:36,990 --> 04:15:38,533
Here, I'm returning this.

3662
04:15:39,843 --> 04:15:41,725
You hang on to that.

3663
04:15:43,000 --> 04:15:43,501
Huh?

3664
04:15:44,079 --> 04:15:45,664
It's proof that you're my pupil.

3665
04:15:47,646 --> 04:15:49,106
O-Okay!

3666
04:15:50,679 --> 04:15:53,474
When you come back to the village,
please train me again!

3667
04:15:54,087 --> 04:15:58,508
Sure... only if you've mastered
the basics that I've taught you.

3668
04:15:59,968 --> 04:16:01,553
You can count on that!

3669
04:16:04,347 --> 04:16:06,850
What were you and Boruto
talking about, Dad?

3670
04:16:08,059 --> 04:16:09,478
Nothing much.

3671
04:16:13,273 --> 04:16:15,734
Hey, Dad... How long are you
staying in the village?

3672
04:16:16,777 --> 04:16:19,571
It will take another day
to analyze the data.

3673
04:16:20,280 --> 04:16:23,116
Then keep me company
while you're waiting!

3674
04:16:23,617 --> 04:16:24,785
What do you want to do?

3675
04:16:25,911 --> 04:16:29,915
I want to perfect
my Fireball Jutsu!

3676
04:16:30,314 --> 04:16:31,649
For the future, just in case...

3677
04:16:32,559 --> 04:16:33,226
Sounds good.

3678
04:16:34,087 --> 04:16:36,339
Yes! Let's go!

3679
04:16:37,547 --> 04:16:38,882
Oh yeah!

3680
04:16:39,129 --> 04:16:41,989
Tonight, Mom said she'll be waiting
and making something special for dinner!

3681
04:16:42,928 --> 04:16:43,887
Let's go, Dad!

3682
04:16:48,116 --> 04:16:48,847
I'm home!

3683
04:16:50,727 --> 04:16:51,478
Dad!

3684
04:16:52,562 --> 04:16:53,271
Hey!

3685
04:16:53,355 --> 04:16:54,481
Welcome home!

3686
04:16:54,874 --> 04:16:56,876
Your father bought this for us.

3687
04:16:57,724 --> 04:16:58,599
Dad did?

3688
04:17:02,633 --> 04:17:04,677
Sorry it's late!

3689
04:17:06,056 --> 04:17:07,475
Thank you, Daddy!

3690
04:17:08,392 --> 04:17:09,101
Dad...

3691
04:17:13,391 --> 04:17:16,060
Seems you're not a Shadow Clone.

3692
04:17:16,586 --> 04:17:18,588
What's the big idea doing that,
all of a sudden?!

3693
04:17:19,579 --> 04:17:21,706
But it's your fault to begin with!

3694
04:17:21,816 --> 04:17:22,817
What did you say?!

3695
04:17:23,162 --> 04:17:24,872
Daddy, Big Brother... Me too!

3696
04:17:24,970 --> 04:17:26,721
Watch out, Himawari!

3697
04:17:26,972 --> 04:17:29,349
Hey, cut it out, everybody!

3698
04:17:30,016 --> 04:17:31,518
I'm going to put the cake away!

3699
04:17:33,478 --> 04:17:35,522
– You can't do that!
– Sorry, Mom!

3700
04:17:35,547 --> 04:17:36,340
I'm sorry!

3701
04:17:40,899 --> 04:17:42,692
Let's eat the cake now!

3702
04:17:43,280 --> 04:17:45,156
Yeah, you're right!

3703
04:17:45,282 --> 04:17:46,908
I'm starving.

3704
04:17:47,534 --> 04:17:48,228
Me too!

3705
04:17:48,743 --> 04:17:50,787
Boruto, go and wash
your hands first.

3706
04:17:51,538 --> 04:17:52,747
I know.

3707
04:17:53,498 --> 04:17:55,750
Mommy, I'll help you!

3708
04:17:56,376 --> 04:17:57,252
All right!

3709
04:17:57,544 --> 04:17:59,963
Could you bring out
the plates to the table?

3710
04:18:00,630 --> 04:18:01,381
Okay!

3711
04:18:02,090 --> 04:18:04,885
I'll help too.

3712
04:18:05,594 --> 04:18:07,470
Dad, you just sit down.

3713
04:18:07,495 --> 04:18:11,123
You must be tired,
especially at your age.

3714
04:18:11,975 --> 04:18:14,686
Don't treat me like an old man,
ya know!

3715
04:18:19,482 --> 04:18:21,234
Happy birthday!

3716
04:18:24,946 --> 04:18:26,281
– Cheers!
– Cheers!

3717
04:18:36,249 --> 04:18:38,752
It's rare for you
to come in person.

3718
04:18:39,595 --> 04:18:42,098
I understand you almost
used Sage Jutsu

3719
04:18:42,256 --> 04:18:44,550
in front of everyone
in the village.

3720
04:18:45,675 --> 04:18:49,387
Do you understand what
that would have meant?

3721
04:18:50,221 --> 04:18:52,974
That power cannot be used
in front of others.

3722
04:18:53,600 --> 04:18:55,977
The average person won't know
what to make of a power

3723
04:18:56,019 --> 04:18:57,771
that is beyond their comprehension.

3724
04:18:58,464 --> 04:19:00,049
I don't care about that.

3725
04:19:00,963 --> 04:19:04,091
What's worse to me is the light
of the sun disappearing.

3726
04:19:05,153 --> 04:19:07,822
Is Boruto truly the sun?

3727
04:19:08,555 --> 04:19:10,056
In order to ascertain that,

3728
04:19:10,081 --> 04:19:13,167
you need to stay and live
among the people.

3729
04:19:14,378 --> 04:19:16,881
However, if you are okay
with this,

3730
04:19:16,944 --> 04:19:19,447
I have nothing more to say.

3731
04:19:21,659 --> 04:19:22,685
I'm sorry I bothered you.

3732
04:19:23,380 --> 04:19:27,509
If I stay too long,
who knows what people will say...

3733
04:19:27,692 --> 04:19:29,235
So I should be leaving.

3734
04:19:33,682 --> 04:19:35,350
<i>Come home once in a while.</i>

3735
04:19:35,934 --> 04:19:39,396
<i>Let me see in person,
the changes that occur in you.</i>

3736
04:19:51,992 --> 04:19:53,785
It's okay, Mom...
You can leave it.

3737
04:19:55,829 --> 04:19:57,038
It looks cool like that.

3738
04:20:04,170 --> 04:20:05,380
Mom, my jacket.

3739
04:20:10,510 --> 04:20:11,886
I have to go now.

3740
04:20:14,915 --> 04:20:16,708
How are you doing on time, Dad?

3741
04:20:18,110 --> 04:20:19,570
Oh, yeah.

3742
04:20:20,311 --> 04:20:21,563
Papa, your lunch!

3743
04:20:21,612 --> 04:20:23,239
Oops.

3744
04:20:23,565 --> 04:20:25,025
Thank you, Himawari

3745
04:20:26,484 --> 04:20:28,236
Oh no, Boruto forgot too.

3746
04:20:31,072 --> 04:20:32,365
I'm off!

3747
04:20:32,574 --> 04:20:33,658
I'll be going now!

3748
04:20:33,700 --> 04:20:35,535
– Have a good day.
– Have a good day.

3749
04:20:37,597 --> 04:20:39,599
Boruto, are you off on a mission?

3750
04:20:39,873 --> 04:20:42,625
Yeah. Do your best at work, Dad!

3751
04:20:43,043 --> 04:20:43,710
Got it!

3752
04:20:59,392 --> 04:21:02,228
<i>What's important is to study hard
and learn, you know?</i>

3753
04:21:02,228 --> 04:21:04,314
<i>So although you're still a genin,</i>

3754
04:21:04,397 --> 04:21:07,067
<i>that's how you fought
alongside the Five Kage</i>

3755
04:21:07,108 --> 04:21:09,110
<i>and helped save us from danger?</i>

3756
04:21:11,196 --> 04:21:14,574
<i>What's the most important thing
for a shinobi?</i>

3757
04:21:15,116 --> 04:21:16,743
<i>Teamwork and perseverance!</i>

3758
04:21:16,785 --> 04:21:18,620
<i>Oh, how wonderful!</i>

3759
04:21:19,265 --> 04:21:20,600
<i>My dad said...</i>

3760
04:21:20,789 --> 04:21:22,445
<i>It's not up here that counts...</i>

3761
04:21:22,470 --> 04:21:24,848
<i>It's what you know and feel here.</i>

3762
04:21:25,335 --> 04:21:26,461
<i>I see.</i>

3763
04:21:26,961 --> 04:21:28,630
<i>Finally, any thoughts
on the resumption</i>

3764
04:21:28,671 --> 04:21:30,215
<i>of the Chunin Selection Exams?</i>

3765
04:21:30,590 --> 04:21:32,509
<i>I'm going to make it this time,
you know!</i>

3766
04:21:34,928 --> 04:21:37,180
<i>This has been a live broadcast.</i>

3767
04:21:38,640 --> 04:21:39,974
A Shadow Clone?

3768
04:21:40,433 --> 04:21:42,519
I hope you're the real one.

3769
04:21:42,602 --> 04:21:43,812
Of course!

3770
04:21:44,604 --> 04:21:47,440
You've been busy with all
those television interviews.

3771
04:21:47,816 --> 04:21:48,983
Even though you cheated.

3772
04:21:49,484 --> 04:21:52,570
How many times have I
apologized for that?

3773
04:21:52,612 --> 04:21:53,822
Give me a break already!

3774
04:22:01,621 --> 04:22:03,832
<i>A panda's escaped from the zoo!</i>

3775
04:22:03,873 --> 04:22:06,177
<i>No, that's a bear!</i>

3776
04:22:06,334 --> 04:22:07,794
Anyway, it's headed your way.

3777
04:22:08,378 --> 04:22:09,170
Roger that!

3778
04:22:09,629 --> 04:22:11,005
Not again... eh?

3779
04:22:11,381 --> 04:22:14,134
I'll be the decoy,
so you guys capture it.

3780
04:22:14,676 --> 04:22:15,677
– Roger!
– Right!

3781
04:22:17,595 --> 04:22:20,014
Do it right this time, you two.

3782
04:22:20,932 --> 04:22:23,685
Boruto, you're the son of
the Seventh Hokage

3783
04:22:23,726 --> 04:22:24,686
and the grandson
of the Fourth Hokage—

3784
04:22:24,769 --> 04:22:25,979
Hey, Boruto...

3785
04:22:28,815 --> 04:22:30,859
Deep down inside, don't you want
to become the Hokage too?

3786
04:22:33,486 --> 04:22:34,863
Me, the Hokage?

3787
04:22:36,865 --> 04:22:37,949
I don't want to!

3788
04:22:38,867 --> 04:22:41,870
But... when you become
the Hokage,

3789
04:22:41,953 --> 04:22:43,580
I'll be your right-hand man.

3790
04:22:43,913 --> 04:22:45,582
I'll guard you well!

3791
04:22:48,251 --> 04:22:50,837
To me,
the Hokage is just a path.

3792
04:22:51,254 --> 04:22:53,715
Just because my grandpa
and dad are Hokage

3793
04:22:53,756 --> 04:22:55,925
doesn't mean I have to walk
the same path.

3794
04:22:57,135 --> 04:22:58,136
Sarada...

3795
04:22:58,803 --> 04:23:00,255
What I'm really aiming for

3796
04:23:00,659 --> 04:23:02,742
is to become a shinobi
like your dad.

3797
04:23:06,556 --> 04:23:08,683
I'm going to follow
my own ninja way!

3798
04:23:24,287 --> 04:23:25,580
All right, here it comes.

3799
04:23:25,789 --> 04:23:27,541
Let's do this, Boruto! Mitsuki!

3800
04:23:27,665 --> 04:23:28,291
– Right!
– Okay!

3801
04:32:42,935 --> 04:32:49,191
<i>Long ago, there was a fox spirit.
This fox had nine tails.</i>

3802
04:32:49,487 --> 04:32:52,570
<i>The fox was sealed inside
a shinobi's child</i>

3803
04:32:52,653 --> 04:32:57,950
<i>and over time,
they became close friends.</i>

3804
04:32:58,284 --> 04:33:01,662
<i>Then a new calamity occurred.
The Ten-Tails was resurrected.</i>

3805
04:33:01,746 --> 04:33:04,790
<i>But the child grew up to be a shinobi,</i>

3806
04:33:04,815 --> 04:33:10,362
<i>and the fox spirit, the child, and the
clans joined to seal away the Ten-Tails.</i>

3807
04:33:11,172 --> 04:33:13,936
<i>This son of the Fourth Hokage</i>

3808
04:33:13,961 --> 04:33:17,298
<i>in whom the fox spirit
was sealed, was named...</i>

3809
04:33:17,511 --> 04:33:20,473
<i>Naruto Uzumaki.</i>
