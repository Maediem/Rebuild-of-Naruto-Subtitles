1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:09,586
<i>In the past, the strongest
shinobi was chosen as a leader,</i>

2
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:13,393
<i>and there were many
who dreamt of becoming a leader.</i>

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,647
<i>This is a dream
that is known as the will of fire.</i>

4
00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:20,964
<i>The will of fire is passed on
from generation to generation.</i>

5
00:00:21,846 --> 00:00:22,930
<i>The will of fire is...</i>

6
00:00:30,678 --> 00:00:33,848
– It will be all right!
– We need to cap this night off with...

7
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:47,964
Naruto's late...

8
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,842
The inauguration ceremony starts
early tomorrow morning.

9
00:00:56,629 --> 00:00:57,630
Oh dear!

10
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,268
– There you go...
– There you go...

11
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,897
Hey, you're home now.

12
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,400
Sorry, Hinata...

13
00:01:07,626 --> 00:01:09,611
He got wasted.

14
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:12,697
Oh Naruto...

15
00:01:12,922 --> 00:01:15,091
You know you're
not a strong drinker...

16
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:18,302
At last, tomorrow is the day when
Naruto takes center stage!

17
00:01:18,595 --> 00:01:22,916
All of us, his friends,
will cheer him at full power!

18
00:01:23,758 --> 00:01:28,138
Well, if you ask me,
I gave up the Hokage's seat to him.

19
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,939
You weren't even a candidate,

20
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,967
so to make such a claim
isn't logical, Kiba.

21
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,386
– Besides...
– Shut up, Shino!

22
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:39,766
Hey, the kids are probably asleep,
so keep it down, guys.

23
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,686
Iruka-sensei...

24
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:49,984
I'll show you...
I'll definitely become the Hokage...

25
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,512
Can you two go
and wake your father up?

26
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:18,805
Okay!

27
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,391
What? Is he seriously
still sleeping?

28
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,376
He's so hopeless!

29
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,650
Daddy, wake up!

30
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,367
Wake up!

31
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,289
Wake... up!

32
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:48,501
"Cutesy coaxing" isn't going to
work on him, Himawari.

33
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:50,269
This is how you do it.

34
00:02:53,155 --> 00:02:55,574
Get up!

35
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,305
– Thank you for the food!
– Thank you for the food!

36
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,974
Thank... you for the food.

37
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,559
Damn it.

38
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,270
Isn't today
the Hokage's Inauguration?

39
00:03:07,595 --> 00:03:09,639
Shouldn't you be getting up
on your own?

40
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,482
You're right, ya know.

41
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:15,278
Boruto's been
looking forward to it!

42
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:18,631
He insisted on waiting up
for you yesterday,

43
00:03:18,714 --> 00:03:20,508
and didn't go bed until late.

44
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,660
Oh, that so?

45
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,495
M-Mom!

46
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,956
I can't wait! I can't wait!

47
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:29,909
I'm going to pick up
your formal attire.

48
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,795
Huh? It isn't ready yet?

49
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,756
Yes, I'm sorry...

50
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:39,142
The artisan who does the embroidery
is very meticulous about her craft.

51
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:42,805
<i>This is one job I can't delegate.</i>

52
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:45,916
<i>This has been my job
for many, many years!</i>

53
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:51,606
She's done the embroidery
for every Hokage so far

54
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,566
and wants it to be perfect.

55
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,693
So I was told that it isn't going to
be finished until the very last minute.

56
00:03:55,718 --> 00:03:56,719
I see...

57
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,996
<i>That's right...</i>

58
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,067
<i>It wasn't finished in time for
Kakashi-sensei's inauguration...</i>

59
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,411
<i>How old is this lady anyway?</i>

60
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,082
I'll go straight to the venue
after I pick it up.

61
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,793
So please go on ahead
with the kids.

62
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,378
Okay, got it.

63
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,588
– Right!
– Bye-bye!

64
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,806
I'll be finally relieved
of my duties, huh?

65
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:29,102
I can't wait to spend the rest of
my life relaxing at a hot spring.

66
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,520
Oh, no...

67
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:33,731
Please don't leave us with a lot of
work that's going to be a drag.

68
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:37,299
We need you to stay on
as an advisor.

69
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,569
Ahem...

70
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,697
Smoking is not allowed here!

71
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,783
I can't smoke anywhere these days...

72
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,451
Anyways...

73
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:47,870
he's late.

74
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,124
Sorry to keep you waiting.

75
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,625
Hey, Hinata.

76
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,796
Where's Naruto?
It's almost time to start!

77
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,880
What?

78
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,300
My husband isn't here yet?

79
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,594
Please take this...

80
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,222
I'm going to go check on him.

81
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,308
Oh... Wait...

82
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,440
Hey, c'mon you two! Let's go!

83
00:05:15,798 --> 00:05:17,800
What are you guys doing?!

84
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:21,237
No! I'm bringing it!

85
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,656
Leave it!
It'll only get in the way!

86
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,909
You'll get tired and
I'll end up carrying it anyway!

87
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,037
I'm bringing it!

88
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,163
Everyone's going to be there!

89
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,664
Put yourself in my shoes!

90
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,167
I don't want to be forced to carry
something so embarrassing!

91
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,626
No!

92
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,962
Leave it at home!

93
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,797
Hey, you two!

94
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:42,967
We have to leave now
or we'll be late!

95
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,984
<i>Uh-oh...
I've really done it....</i>

96
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,865
S-Sorry...
But if you weren't pulling so hard...

97
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:10,119
Hey! Will you two cut it—!

98
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,310
<i>The same eyes as Mom's!</i>

99
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:22,098
Oww!

100
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:23,191
Boruto!

101
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:28,846
D-Dad! All of a sudden Himawari's
gone crazy and she's super strong!

102
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,350
The Byakugan?!

103
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:34,318
What the hell is going on?

104
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,064
Here she comes!

105
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,066
Locked on.

106
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,194
This is bad!

107
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,833
What in the world is
holding Naruto up?

108
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,584
He won't make it in time.

109
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,670
Well then, we have no other choice.

110
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,422
Hey, Konohamaru!

111
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:04,941
Yes?

112
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:24,569
We will now begin the inauguration
of the Seventh Hokage.

113
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:28,406
I, Kakashi Hatake,
the Sixth Hokage,

114
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:32,160
will be the one presiding over
the ceremony today.

115
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:41,919
And now,
here is the man of the hour.

116
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,590
The hero of the ninja world who
guided us after the Great Ninja War.

117
00:07:46,073 --> 00:07:49,368
The man who will succeed me
as the Seventh Hokage!

118
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,638
The man you all know...

119
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,266
Naruto Uzumaki!

120
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:05,860
Thank you!
Thank you!

121
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,367
That guy...

122
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,329
Thank you, hey!

123
00:08:17,321 --> 00:08:18,864
<i>Sorry, Big Brother Naruto...</i>

124
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:22,335
<i>But I'm going to fool everyone with
my Transformation Jutsu, eh!</i>

125
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,337
Naruto?!

126
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,589
Get ahold of yourself, Naruto...

127
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,842
This is... a halted chakra point!

128
00:08:30,842 --> 00:08:33,011
Which means he'll be
unconscious all day...

129
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,139
Who did this?!

130
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,810
Big Brother?

131
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,355
Are you playing hide-and-seek?

132
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:47,985
<i>I had no idea Himawari was
this dangerous when she's upset!</i>

133
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,032
Are you here?

134
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,665
Big Brother...

135
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,169
I... found... you...

136
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:16,722
<i>That day, I swore that I'd never
upset Himawari, ever again.</i>

137
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,320
Hamburger steak!

138
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:55,529
No!

139
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,906
Hamburger steak!

140
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:57,990
Rice porridge!

141
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:02,203
I'm telling you! Himawari said
she wanted to eat hamburger steak!

142
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:05,940
No! Because rice porridge is what
you eat when you're sick!

143
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,292
Hey... hold on...

144
00:11:08,317 --> 00:11:09,651
– Hamburger steak!
– Rice porridge!

145
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,588
Her fever went down.
So what's the harm?

146
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,423
No means no!

147
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,092
Why?
Hamburger steak!

148
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,259
Rice porridge!

149
00:11:17,284 --> 00:11:18,285
Hamburg steak!

150
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,770
You're not the one
who's going to eat it!

151
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,222
I know I'm not going to be eating it!

152
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,166
– Rice porridge!
– Hey... You two.

153
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,314
If you're going to be noisy,
go outside!

154
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,863
See? You made Mom all mad.

155
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,074
She got mad because of you.

156
00:11:41,475 --> 00:11:44,436
Okay, Himawari's seems better,

157
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,964
and I left a pile of
unfinished work, so...

158
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,666
I should be getting back.

159
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,090
Want to go get a bite to eat?

160
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:57,883
Huh? With you?

161
00:11:58,183 --> 00:12:00,101
You said you had work left...

162
00:12:00,194 --> 00:12:02,613
I haven't eaten yet.

163
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,057
And I can't work when I'm hungry.

164
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:08,894
You don't want to?

165
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,903
Fine, I'll come along.

166
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,322
So, where are we going?

167
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:32,877
I've been coming to this shop
since I was a little kid.

168
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,628
It holds a lot of memories for me.

169
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,507
It used to be such a small shop,
but now...

170
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,718
<i>Seriously, ramen?</i>

171
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:47,224
Mom says you eat hamburgers
every chance you get.

172
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,852
That's a totally unbalanced diet.

173
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:50,895
Huh?

174
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,481
So is only eating ramen!

175
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,768
You just don't know how good
Ichiraku ramen is.

176
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,906
The nutritional content is
on the same level as Food Pills...

177
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:05,576
And it's recommended by
the jonin of the village,

178
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,077
starting with the Sixth Hokage.

179
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,829
Seriously?

180
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:10,998
Welcome...

181
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,793
Oh, it's been a while,
Lord Seventh!

182
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,420
Sorry, I haven't been able to
drop by lately.

183
00:13:16,503 --> 00:13:18,880
Oh, you must be busy.

184
00:13:19,406 --> 00:13:22,242
Oh, you brought your son today?

185
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:23,427
Hello.

186
00:13:23,518 --> 00:13:26,521
You've grown so much
since I last saw you.

187
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,058
Nah, he's still just a kid.

188
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:30,976
What will you have?

189
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:35,022
Two special ramen... and...

190
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,026
Is my wedding gift coupon still good?

191
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,694
Of course!

192
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,322
My father,
the founder of this shop,

193
00:13:43,488 --> 00:13:45,490
gave it to you as a wedding gift!

194
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,909
We'd be so honored.

195
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:47,902
Besides,

196
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:50,394
it's all thanks to the patronage of
the ninja world's hero,

197
00:13:50,503 --> 00:13:53,381
that our shop has grown so much.

198
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,458
See?

199
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,005
What...?

200
00:14:14,336 --> 00:14:18,089
Man, this smell
brings back memories...

201
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,235
Everything's shiny and new now,

202
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,947
but this is where your mom and I
went to eat on our first date.

203
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:30,243
Aren't you supposed to go someplace
fancier for that kind of thing?

204
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:35,374
No, your mom said,
"I'd love to get some ramen."

205
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,917
Seriously?

206
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:41,255
I can't picture Mom
loving ramen that much.

207
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,673
I'm telling you, it's true.

208
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:47,428
And your mom's
loved this place ever since.

209
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,637
Okay, okay.

210
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,642
By the way, how are things
at the Academy?

211
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,520
So-so...

212
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,608
Don't give the teachers
too much trouble...

213
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:03,235
– Although I...
– This is Kagemasa!

214
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,230
I didn't know they had
stuff like this.

215
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,908
What? You like that stuff?

216
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:12,328
Not me. My friends do...

217
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,580
Denki and Iwabe...

218
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,792
<i>He's still just a kid when
it comes to this sort of stuff...</i>

219
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:22,254
<i>Well, it seems he's
steadily making friends too.</i>

220
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,756
<i>So that's good.</i>

221
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,300
Thanks for waiting!

222
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:35,225
The time-honored Five Kage Summit
is fast approaching.

223
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,520
The Hidden Leaf Village will be
the site of this year's conference,

224
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,398
and the Kage from each village
will be assembling

225
00:15:41,423 --> 00:15:43,592
to discuss many topics.

226
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,781
So are things going to get busy
for you again?

227
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,324
Yeah...

228
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,410
That's fine with me, just...

229
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:56,622
don't make Mom and Himawari sad.

230
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,123
Yeah...

231
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,877
Hey, you're still a kid, so don't
worry about such things, Boruto.

232
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:08,759
And whose fault is it that I can't
just be a happy-go-lucky kid?

233
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,261
Welcome!

234
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,139
– Oh?
– Hey, what a coincidence.

235
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,557
H-Hey...

236
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:18,444
What, Choji? You brought
your daughter here to eat too?

237
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,145
Well, yeah.

238
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:25,651
Dad and I are going to start having
our monthly ramen-eating contest.

239
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:29,738
You're battling your daughter?

240
00:16:29,887 --> 00:16:31,780
Don't interfere, Naruto.

241
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:36,245
This is a serious battle
for us chubby types.

242
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,664
Our pride is on the line!

243
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:41,792
In this world of extreme calories,
parental ties don't matter!

244
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,946
I-I see...
Do your best...?

245
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,925
<i>I don't quite get it,
but they seem to be having fun.</i>

246
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,971
<i>Why can't our family
be more like that?</i>

247
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,936
<i>That makes it sound like
I want to be closer</i>

248
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,272
<i>to that stupid old man!</i>

249
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,189
What's the matter?

250
00:17:04,564 --> 00:17:05,732
Nothing at all!

251
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,152
Today, I'm definitely going to
break your legendary record...

252
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:12,489
No, I'm going to break the Legendary
Queen of Gluttony's record!

253
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,432
Legendary Queen of Gluttony?

254
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,035
Who the hell is that?

255
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,037
Hey, enough already.

256
00:17:18,062 --> 00:17:19,897
Let's eat before
the noodles get too soft!

257
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,291
O-Okay.

258
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,128
That hit the spot!

259
00:17:29,864 --> 00:17:31,004
Wasn't it good?

260
00:17:32,401 --> 00:17:34,153
I guess it was okay.

261
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:36,145
That's good.

262
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,266
I told you I have
lots of memories here.

263
00:17:39,941 --> 00:17:41,484
The appearance may have changed,

264
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:45,147
but this place holds a lot of
precious memories from the past.

265
00:18:06,768 --> 00:18:08,729
I-It's a tie.

266
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,892
I guess I was
a little short of beating

267
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,428
the Legendary Queen of Gluttony...

268
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:17,562
bleh.

269
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:18,931
See you, Choji.

270
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,557
Y-Yeah...

271
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,559
Thank you for coming.

272
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,062
I can't believe those two...

273
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:28,982
Just who the hell is
this Legendary Queen anyway?

274
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:32,486
What? You haven't told your son?

275
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,446
Uh, Boruto...

276
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,535
Mom?!

277
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:42,788
<i>Seriously?</i>

278
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:51,713
This photo...

279
00:18:54,274 --> 00:18:57,861
It's from after
the Inauguration Ceremony...

280
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:02,808
Who would have thought Himawari
would awaken her Byakugan?

281
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,195
Still, it's too bad
you couldn't attend

282
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,138
your own inauguration ceremony...

283
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,408
It was your dream for so long.

284
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:24,496
Yeah, but now...
I have a different dream.

285
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,416
A different dream?

286
00:19:28,892 --> 00:19:29,684
Yeah...

287
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:34,089
Now that I'm the Hokage,
the entire village is my family.

288
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:39,344
So... I want to protect and
cherish my huge family.

289
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,264
Naruto...

290
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:49,021
I probably sound like
Grandpa Third...

291
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,942
<i>But I've realized my dream of
becoming the Hokage...</i>

292
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,069
<i>and so, this is my new dream.</i>

293
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:02,492
<i>Even if you realize one dream,
it's never over for you...</i>

294
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,830
<i>You're still chasing your dreams,</i>

295
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:08,498
<i>aren't you, Naruto?</i>

296
00:20:32,055 --> 00:20:34,182
Now you're a bit more handsome.

297
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,324
At least show me the steps.

298
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:43,575
Idiot.

299
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,662
Figuring out for yourself is
a valuable part of training.

300
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:48,997
That just makes it more of a drag!

301
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,337
What the hell is he doing?

302
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,464
<i>Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll!</i>

303
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,429
<i>Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll!</i>

304
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,767
What is that? Graffiti?

305
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,603
Your sense of style is pretty
old-fashioned, Dad.

306
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,067
Set your heart on fire!

307
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,568
Yes, Dad!

308
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:22,189
All right then.

309
00:21:22,655 --> 00:21:24,056
Pretty soon now...

310
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,203
Boruto!

311
00:21:28,753 --> 00:21:31,089
Don't get carried away
ridiculing your dad!

312
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,166
You're the ridiculous one!

313
00:21:39,873 --> 00:21:40,957
A Shadow Clone?

314
00:21:41,474 --> 00:21:42,767
Over here!

315
00:21:42,793 --> 00:21:44,169
Stop right there, Boruto!

316
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,148
There's no way I'll let myself
get caught so easily.

317
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,525
Idiots never learn their lesson.

318
00:21:59,668 --> 00:22:02,571
Shh!

319
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:08,493
Sarada!

320
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:09,911
Lord Seventh!

321
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,289
Have you seen Boruto?

322
00:22:18,411 --> 00:22:19,296
He went that way.

323
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:20,638
Thank you!

324
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,181
I should be the one
saying thanks, Sarada.

325
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,600
Damn it.

326
00:22:31,742 --> 00:22:35,187
Getting upset over a little
graffiti on the Great Stone Faces...

327
00:22:35,237 --> 00:22:36,905
Such a petty old man!

328
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:39,866
You just wanted him to
come after you, right?

329
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:44,963
You're just upset because he
doesn't pay enough attention to you.

330
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,267
You're wrong!

331
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:48,825
We haven't played tag in a while...

332
00:22:49,108 --> 00:22:52,069
And I have to break
the record from last time!

333
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,668
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu...

334
00:22:59,443 --> 00:23:00,319
Boruto...

335
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,048
Don't make too much trouble
for Lord Seventh.

336
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:06,151
The Hokage is under
a lot of pressure...

337
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,178
And that goes for me, his adviser.

338
00:23:08,496 --> 00:23:09,805
Damn it!

339
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:13,500
Lord Hokage sure has it rough,
having to deal with the likes of you.

340
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,268
That was a Shadow Clone!

341
00:23:15,535 --> 00:23:18,830
The real stupid old man...
went back to work ages ago!

342
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:23,402
If Lord Seventh used Sage Mode,
he'd find you in a flash!

343
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,696
I know that.
And that's why...

344
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:30,450
I kept running away
until Dad got serious!

345
00:23:30,717 --> 00:23:33,470
Neither father nor son
knows when to quit.

346
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,873
You and Naruto are so much alike.

347
00:23:37,265 --> 00:23:39,943
Don't lump me in with Dad!

348
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:44,339
Shikadai, go and get
Lord Seventh's shadow clone.

349
00:23:44,731 --> 00:23:46,608
Huh? Why me?

350
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,176
Then will you take over here?

351
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,932
This is such a drag.

352
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,601
Seems like we're alike too.

353
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,770
It's a drag for me too.

354
00:23:58,795 --> 00:23:59,879
Now, get going!

355
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,884
Yeah... Run with spirit!

356
00:24:08,909 --> 00:24:09,701
Yes!

357
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:11,591
Next up,
is cliff-climbing!

358
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:12,951
Yes, Dad!

359
00:24:16,145 --> 00:24:18,105
If you're not going to eat that,
I'm going to take it!

360
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:20,300
Are you ignoring me?

361
00:24:20,743 --> 00:24:22,294
Adolescent mood swing?

362
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:25,363
Everyone gets along so well.

363
00:24:26,856 --> 00:24:30,224
Graduation exams aren't even soon.

364
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,679
Are you talking about the tests?

365
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,417
If this test would
change my weight,

366
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:38,994
I'd consider taking it.

367
00:24:39,928 --> 00:24:42,138
So what's the big deal
about becoming a ninja?

368
00:24:43,172 --> 00:24:45,466
What does everyone want to be?

369
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:50,197
I mean... doesn't ninja
sound pretty lame?

370
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:55,285
What's with all this?
Did something happen?

371
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,269
Not really...

372
00:24:57,328 --> 00:24:59,330
Anyway, where are you going
from now?

373
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,625
I have time today,
so I'll go wherever you want!

374
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,293
Actually...

375
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:08,256
I promised Dad that
I'd train with him later.

376
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:11,701
I see...

377
00:25:12,527 --> 00:25:15,571
Of course,
to me training is whatever...

378
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:19,017
I have zero desire to go, but...

379
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,561
You should go.

380
00:25:23,304 --> 00:25:25,147
You don't want to fail
the exam, do you?

381
00:25:26,006 --> 00:25:28,217
What's with that
condescending attitude?

382
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:31,229
It really gets on my nerves!

383
00:25:31,637 --> 00:25:35,634
You might think you're really special
being from the one and only Uchiha Clan...

384
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,869
so you don't have to worry.

385
00:25:38,478 --> 00:25:40,730
That's got nothing to do with it.

386
00:25:41,814 --> 00:25:43,608
Then what is it?

387
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:47,628
It's a special chance...

388
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:49,130
for you and your dad-

389
00:25:49,155 --> 00:25:50,114
Hey!

390
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:52,008
Cho-Cho!

391
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,211
Over here! Over here!

392
00:25:54,236 --> 00:25:56,071
Damn it! So embarrassing!

393
00:25:56,228 --> 00:25:58,647
Wh-What's wrong with
a grown-up eating potato chips

394
00:25:58,672 --> 00:26:00,382
as he walks around town?

395
00:26:00,583 --> 00:26:01,459
No!

396
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:04,120
He's such a poser,

397
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:06,140
he's eating lightly salted chips
just for show!

398
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:08,459
He usually eats
the consommé-flavored ones!

399
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:11,836
We really don't see eye to eye,
the two of us!

400
00:26:12,412 --> 00:26:13,955
Oh, that's the problem.

401
00:26:14,163 --> 00:26:17,542
Cho-Cho, over here. Over here!

402
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,119
I'm over here!

403
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:23,039
So strange.

404
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:28,920
Don't you think my dad and I
are different in every way?

405
00:26:31,105 --> 00:26:32,523
I wonder about that...

406
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:34,751
What about your family?

407
00:26:35,092 --> 00:26:36,385
M-My family?

408
00:26:36,786 --> 00:26:38,830
Are you and your dad alike?

409
00:26:41,048 --> 00:26:42,299
I really don't know.

410
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:45,052
For as long as I can remember...

411
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,939
I've never even met him.

412
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:57,115
Where are you,
and what are you doing?

413
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,528
I'm home!

414
00:27:03,187 --> 00:27:04,730
I'm so exhausted!

415
00:27:05,031 --> 00:27:06,491
Welcome home!

416
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:08,426
Is something wrong?

417
00:27:08,552 --> 00:27:10,888
My eyes got blurry.

418
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:14,173
It happens once in a while.

419
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,259
Let me see!

420
00:27:20,146 --> 00:27:22,565
I-It just got a little blurry.

421
00:27:23,707 --> 00:27:24,917
It's better now.

422
00:27:25,292 --> 00:27:27,918
Maybe my glasses need adjusting.

423
00:27:28,195 --> 00:27:30,906
It might be good to go
get them checked.

424
00:27:31,348 --> 00:27:33,225
Don't make such
a big deal out of it.

425
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,387
You should worry about yourself.

426
00:27:35,412 --> 00:27:37,331
You really work too hard.

427
00:27:47,998 --> 00:27:48,999
So, um...

428
00:27:49,517 --> 00:27:50,393
Yeah?

429
00:27:50,777 --> 00:27:53,696
Did Dad... wear glasses?

430
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,965
What makes you ask
such a question?

431
00:27:56,524 --> 00:27:58,064
You have good eyes,

432
00:27:58,518 --> 00:28:02,098
so I wondered if my needing glasses
comes from Dad.

433
00:28:04,024 --> 00:28:05,609
I don't think so.

434
00:28:06,067 --> 00:28:06,943
Probably.

435
00:28:06,968 --> 00:28:07,969
"Probably"?

436
00:28:09,028 --> 00:28:11,405
You're not sure even
though he's your husband?

437
00:28:11,955 --> 00:28:15,584
What's going on?
You've been acting weird lately.

438
00:28:16,193 --> 00:28:18,904
When is Dad's important mission
supposed to end?

439
00:28:19,505 --> 00:28:22,578
Well... I think it'll end someday.

440
00:28:23,517 --> 00:28:24,961
I guess you wouldn't know.

441
00:28:25,828 --> 00:28:28,373
After all, you don't even know
if he wore glasses.

442
00:28:34,962 --> 00:28:36,713
That was harsh, Sarada.

443
00:28:41,628 --> 00:28:45,256
<i>What's wrong with wanting
to know a little about Dad?</i>

444
00:28:52,547 --> 00:28:56,635
"The Uchiha Clan is among
the most venerable clans

445
00:28:56,708 --> 00:28:59,378
that bore many skilled ninja."

446
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:03,449
"Their Sharingan is considered
their greatest trait."

447
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,087
"When it awakens,
a special pattern appears in the eye,

448
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:12,250
enabling one to see through taijutsu,
genjutsu and ninjutsu."

449
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:18,490
"Even more exceptional is the Mangekyo
Sharingan, which has a different pattern."

450
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,709
The Sharingan, huh?

451
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,263
I wonder if Dad has it...

452
00:29:27,215 --> 00:29:32,053
"The Sharingan awakens when
there is deep emotional trauma."

453
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:37,608
"Unique chakra emitted inside
the brain by pain and suffering

454
00:29:37,633 --> 00:29:39,218
affects the optic nerves...

455
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:41,963
transforming the eyes
into the Sharingan."

456
00:29:44,281 --> 00:29:47,410
"The Uchiha Clan,
due to grave misfortune,

457
00:29:47,718 --> 00:29:49,886
nearly lost its entire lineage."

458
00:29:50,438 --> 00:29:52,732
"At the present time,
the only ones known to be living

459
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,960
to carry on the bloodline...

460
00:29:56,244 --> 00:29:59,998
Sasuke Uchiha and his daughter."

461
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,895
Excuse me, I'd like to see
the next set of data

462
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,422
pertaining to Sasuke Uchiha.

463
00:30:15,554 --> 00:30:17,598
Sure! Hold on a minute!

464
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:25,907
It seems access to data
relating to Sasuke Uchiha is restricted.

465
00:30:26,382 --> 00:30:28,051
Restricted?

466
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,911
Does that mean I can't see them?

467
00:30:30,085 --> 00:30:30,961
Why is that?

468
00:30:31,504 --> 00:30:32,547
Who knows?

469
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,375
I don't make the rules.

470
00:30:35,883 --> 00:30:37,635
But you can submit
a request to view them.

471
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,536
Although the result
will probably be the same.

472
00:30:40,864 --> 00:30:43,424
No, it's all right.

473
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,104
Mom...

474
00:30:59,615 --> 00:31:00,365
Hmm?

475
00:31:01,117 --> 00:31:02,118
Can I ask you something?

476
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,653
Sure.

477
00:31:04,386 --> 00:31:06,680
Why doesn't Dad come home?

478
00:31:07,915 --> 00:31:10,918
You know where he is and
what he's doing, don't you?

479
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,954
That again?

480
00:31:13,854 --> 00:31:16,649
Hmm... I wonder what he's doing.

481
00:31:19,185 --> 00:31:20,436
What's the matter?

482
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,837
Please don't dodge my question.

483
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:25,566
Every time I ask,
you keep saying you don't know.

484
00:31:26,233 --> 00:31:28,026
How can you call yourself
his wife?

485
00:31:28,844 --> 00:31:29,804
Sarada...

486
00:31:30,187 --> 00:31:31,063
Right now...

487
00:31:39,012 --> 00:31:40,180
Mom...

488
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,984
Are you really Dad's wife?

489
00:31:43,718 --> 00:31:46,054
What's with all this so suddenly?

490
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,446
It's not sudden!

491
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,699
I've been wondering for ages!

492
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,452
Do you really think
you can keep on fooling me?!

493
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:56,539
You're... acting kinda weird today.

494
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,752
What's weird is
your relationship with Dad.

495
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:03,796
And it's not just kinda, but a lot!

496
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,090
Sarada!

497
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:18,061
I'm sorry I raised my voice.

498
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:22,315
When he's finished with his mission,

499
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,108
Dad will come home.

500
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,194
How do you know that?

501
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,822
You've been apart for so long!

502
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:34,285
Maybe he's forgotten
all about us!

503
00:32:42,176 --> 00:32:45,235
Your dad and I are connected
through our feelings,

504
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:46,923
so don't worry!

505
00:32:48,291 --> 00:32:51,378
How can you say that
with such confidence?

506
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,190
No way!

507
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,567
The loan isn't...

508
00:33:13,975 --> 00:33:17,311
She's always been prone
to fainting.

509
00:33:19,113 --> 00:33:22,700
We've been very busy lately,
so her fatigue probably built up.

510
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:25,903
She'll wake up tomorrow

511
00:33:26,361 --> 00:33:28,947
I said some terrible things to Mom...

512
00:33:30,225 --> 00:33:31,184
The loan...

513
00:33:34,269 --> 00:33:36,104
I'm going to admit her
into the hospital.

514
00:33:36,197 --> 00:33:37,448
Would you like to come too?

515
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,017
I'll come by later.

516
00:33:39,783 --> 00:33:42,411
I want to salvage
some important things...

517
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,607
Found it!

518
00:34:08,253 --> 00:34:11,256
Who's this next to Dad?

519
00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:13,925
The woman with glasses.

520
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:30,818
I see...

521
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,029
So you were looking
for your dad's photos.

522
00:34:33,955 --> 00:34:35,248
It wasn't that...!

523
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,576
That looks like a pretty old photo.

524
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,414
What's my dad like now?

525
00:34:43,672 --> 00:34:44,881
That's right.

526
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:49,295
You haven't seen your dad
since you were a baby.

527
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,716
There's something I'd like
to ask you, Ms. Shizune.

528
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,594
Please don't tell my mom...

529
00:34:58,078 --> 00:35:00,622
Of course, Sakura is your mother!

530
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:04,852
Then please tell me more
about my birth!

531
00:35:05,018 --> 00:35:07,020
Who delivered me?

532
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,523
Who was there when I was born?!

533
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,151
That's...

534
00:35:12,367 --> 00:35:15,287
Your response is the same
as everyone else's, Ms. Shizune.

535
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:19,500
I checked and I know.

536
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:23,996
That there's no record of my birth
in any of the hospitals in the Leaf.

537
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,290
That doesn't mean...

538
00:35:26,882 --> 00:35:29,885
Anyway, why are you
so curious about this now?

539
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:37,426
Because this woman...
has the same glasses as me.

540
00:35:45,284 --> 00:35:47,995
Dad! I said stop it!

541
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:52,066
Could you not super-size yourself
when you're with your daughter.

542
00:35:52,249 --> 00:35:52,900
Huh?

543
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,864
More importantly,

544
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:00,142
why would anyone eat something
like that in the morning?

545
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:04,101
Well, you can be careful, but
when you die, you die. That's life.

546
00:36:04,728 --> 00:36:06,339
Not that I'd ever eat this stuff.

547
00:36:07,047 --> 00:36:08,690
You're still a child, Cho-Cho,

548
00:36:08,715 --> 00:36:11,050
so you need to eat up
in order to grow!

549
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:15,131
I'm pretty big already,
even among my peers, Dad.

550
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,932
And you, Mom!

551
00:36:16,957 --> 00:36:21,027
Seriously, please quit it with your
condescending and know-it-all attitude!

552
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:25,349
Now I'm all hungry again
because you made me mad!

553
00:36:25,606 --> 00:36:27,541
I have no choice
but to have seconds!

554
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:31,647
Sarada!

555
00:36:32,841 --> 00:36:33,941
Oh, hey...

556
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:39,780
They say food doesn't go down well
when you're troubled.

557
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,199
It's so true.

558
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,868
So even you feel troubled.

559
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:46,495
Hey, Sarada...

560
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:49,624
Will you promise not to tell anyone?

561
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,918
Sure... What is it?

562
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,798
I have a feeling I'm not really
Mom and Dad's kid!

563
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,301
I mean...

564
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:03,029
I don't look like
either of them at all.

565
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,600
Y-You think so?

566
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:12,688
Once when I was little,
I had a really high fever.

567
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:19,345
I can't believe
you were able to get this!

568
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,705
I bet it was difficult!

569
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,199
Hurry and give it to her.

570
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,702
Cho-Cho, here's some medicine.

571
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,246
You're going to be okay now!

572
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,629
Feel better soon!

573
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,300
Thank... you.

574
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:46,222
I can still feel his touch
from that day...

575
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:52,144
I think that handsome,
manly man is my real dad.

576
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:54,105
I see...

577
00:37:54,613 --> 00:37:57,908
That's called the
"tragic heroine syndrome."

578
00:37:58,818 --> 00:37:59,644
Huh?

579
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:03,531
A condition that unconsciously
occurs in girls of a certain age

580
00:38:03,738 --> 00:38:05,907
when attempting
to define who they are.

581
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:08,386
Who do you think
you are, Mitsuki?

582
00:38:08,418 --> 00:38:10,253
What's with that
condescending attitude?

583
00:38:10,395 --> 00:38:15,108
You wouldn't understand the mind
of a delicate maiden, right, Sarada?

584
00:38:15,558 --> 00:38:17,135
I can tell without looking
at your crest

585
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,622
that you're from
the Akimichi Clan!

586
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:22,466
So relax!

587
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:24,802
Get lost, you insensitive jerk!

588
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:28,597
Damn it!
I'm actually worrying here!

589
00:38:29,522 --> 00:38:30,523
I know that feeling.

590
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,979
Wondering if they're your real
mom and dad...

591
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:36,981
Seriously?

592
00:38:37,131 --> 00:38:39,299
You are my best friend,
after all.

593
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,363
So anyway, I have a favor
to ask of my best friend.

594
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,073
Will you hear me out?

595
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,408
What is it?

596
00:38:47,633 --> 00:38:50,567
I'm... thinking of going
on a journey.

597
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,372
To find my real mom and dad.

598
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,666
You'll come with me, won't you?

599
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,003
Huh? What's the matter?

600
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,631
Yes... That's it!

601
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:04,342
Sarada?

602
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,764
<i>Why didn't I think of this before?</i>

603
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:13,517
<i>I just have to find my dad
and ask him directly!</i>

604
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,312
<i>If you want to know about Sasuke,</i>

605
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:18,272
<i>maybe you should
ask Lord Seventh?</i>

606
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:21,859
We'll leave as soon as
we get packed!

607
00:39:21,884 --> 00:39:22,760
Okay?

608
00:39:23,019 --> 00:39:24,695
Got it?!

609
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,156
<i>I'm going to wring it out of him!</i>

610
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:28,966
<i>Every last detail!</i>

611
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,778
Who...

612
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,238
are you?

613
00:40:57,746 --> 00:41:01,709
Shikamaru, how many headbands
do we need to order again?

614
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:05,754
I can take care of stuff like that,
so you should...

615
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,217
It's Sasuke's hawk.

616
00:41:13,479 --> 00:41:16,774
That guy's so analog...

617
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:18,684
80% of Sasuke's missions

618
00:41:18,867 --> 00:41:21,829
take him to places where
he can't charge his devices.

619
00:41:22,053 --> 00:41:23,262
Give him a break.

620
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:26,275
This is—!

621
00:41:30,186 --> 00:41:31,354
What is it, Naruto?

622
00:41:32,197 --> 00:41:35,659
Didn't I tell you I'd be on leave?

623
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,457
I see...

624
00:41:42,441 --> 00:41:45,152
If this guy really does
have the Sharingan...

625
00:41:45,177 --> 00:41:46,887
It seems impossible
in the first place...

626
00:41:47,263 --> 00:41:50,674
He's either an Uchiha survivor or...

627
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:53,050
someone connected to him.

628
00:42:01,292 --> 00:42:03,294
So, you've seen him?

629
00:42:04,721 --> 00:42:07,266
And? How was Sasuke Uchiha?

630
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:11,403
Strong... Really strong.

631
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:15,658
That's nothing like his true power.

632
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:19,478
The power of Sasuke Uchiha's
Sharingan, that is...

633
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,455
Sharingan?

634
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,917
He killed Itachi...

635
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,919
He's unforgivable. Must kill...

636
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,212
That's right.

637
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:32,341
Sasuke... the disgrace of
the proud Uchiha.

638
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:37,221
He doesn't deserve to
have the Sharingan.

639
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:47,022
I'll contact you again
if I learn anything new.

640
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,986
I have to get the details
from him personally.

641
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:53,462
In any case,

642
00:42:53,561 --> 00:42:55,188
I'm going to go meet up
with Sasuke.

643
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,870
I'm leaving a Shadow Clone here
in the village,

644
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:04,039
and going over there personally.

645
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:07,293
For such a tiny ember,
it's flared up into something huge.

646
00:43:07,725 --> 00:43:08,893
The quicker you go, the better.

647
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:09,911
Yeah.

648
00:43:52,045 --> 00:43:52,921
All right!

649
00:43:58,435 --> 00:44:00,937
Take care of things
in the village for me.

650
00:44:01,287 --> 00:44:02,038
Yeah.

651
00:44:10,588 --> 00:44:12,590
Sorry to keep you waiting...

652
00:44:13,293 --> 00:44:16,278
What's going on?
You seem a lot more excited than I am.

653
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,821
Oh, Cho-Cho!

654
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:19,490
You sure brought a lot of stuff.

655
00:44:20,767 --> 00:44:23,661
Well, it may turn out to
be a long journey.

656
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:25,954
See...

657
00:44:26,573 --> 00:44:28,515
I'm prepared for anything!

658
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,669
Yeah... that's amazing...

659
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:35,297
I swear I'm going to
find my real dad.

660
00:44:45,991 --> 00:44:47,576
<i>Feel better soon!</i>

661
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:52,856
That handsome manly man
who saved my life.

662
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:58,000
I just know he's my real dad!

663
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,283
All right, I'm going to get going.

664
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:11,458
Tell Boruto I'm sorry...

665
00:45:15,728 --> 00:45:17,188
That's Lord Seventh...

666
00:45:17,364 --> 00:45:18,865
Wait, he's going out on a trip too?

667
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,009
Wh-What?!

668
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,055
That hurt!

669
00:45:26,756 --> 00:45:28,967
I'm sorry.
Are you all right?!

670
00:45:29,408 --> 00:45:31,494
How come you're the one
taking charge?

671
00:45:31,871 --> 00:45:33,731
Hey, you're angry, aren't you?

672
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:39,094
You just missed him.

673
00:45:41,446 --> 00:45:42,363
Oh...

674
00:45:42,514 --> 00:45:45,392
I get it, so that's why
he wanted me to tell you sorry.

675
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,705
Let's go, Mitsuki.

676
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:51,948
Maybe we can still catch up to him.

677
00:45:51,973 --> 00:45:53,016
Boruto!

678
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:57,463
Do you want me to deliver
that lunch box for you?

679
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:58,505
Huh?

680
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:01,049
Sarada...

681
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:04,344
We're going on a little trip now.

682
00:46:04,502 --> 00:46:07,213
If you like, we can take that
to Lord Seventh.

683
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:09,415
Cho-Cho, that's okay, right?

684
00:46:09,616 --> 00:46:11,368
I don't mind, but...

685
00:46:11,417 --> 00:46:12,877
Is there enough for me?

686
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:14,521
No, never mind.

687
00:46:15,346 --> 00:46:17,974
I'm taking it back to Mom and
giving her a piece of my mind.

688
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,944
Always making lunches for him...
She should know better.

689
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:22,112
She always...

690
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:28,577
What is it?

691
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:31,038
I'm saying I'll deliver it to him.

692
00:46:31,563 --> 00:46:33,189
And I'm saying it's okay.

693
00:46:35,818 --> 00:46:38,779
If you don't want it,
I'll eat it for you!

694
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:42,257
Can you come over here with me?

695
00:46:43,917 --> 00:46:45,085
Are you going to ask me out?

696
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:48,222
Your condition is pretty advanced.

697
00:46:51,549 --> 00:46:53,718
Just mind your own business!

698
00:46:54,361 --> 00:46:56,738
You know the person
who's going to deliver it.

699
00:46:56,763 --> 00:46:58,098
So, what's the problem?

700
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:01,318
In this case, I'm qualified to deliver it.

701
00:47:05,212 --> 00:47:06,779
I swear I'll get it to him.

702
00:47:07,223 --> 00:47:10,762
I won't let the lunch your mom
made for the Seventh Hokage...

703
00:47:11,753 --> 00:47:13,154
go to waste.

704
00:47:13,755 --> 00:47:15,631
Why are you so persistent?

705
00:47:17,026 --> 00:47:20,337
A boxed lunch isn't just about the food...

706
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:24,591
When you know how special
the person who made it for you is.

707
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,806
What's going on with you?

708
00:47:33,983 --> 00:47:36,402
Naruto is heading towards
the Shikoro Pass.

709
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,522
Boruto, let her take it.

710
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:41,233
Fine...

711
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:43,443
Here.

712
00:47:46,779 --> 00:47:48,489
I promise to get it to him.

713
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:49,867
Yeah.

714
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:53,161
Let's go, Cho-Cho!

715
00:47:53,711 --> 00:47:54,571
'Kay!

716
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:59,793
I think he's into me.

717
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:01,419
Seriously though, no thanks!

718
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,139
<i>Finally, I get to meet you...</i>

719
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:06,800
<i>Dad!</i>

720
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,181
She's so weird.

721
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,863
They're on the move.

722
00:48:29,748 --> 00:48:31,583
I... saw it too.

723
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,703
Let's move on to the next job, Shin.

724
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:36,905
Bring me his daughter.

725
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:40,518
The one with the glasses,

726
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:43,546
who's wearing the Uchiha crest,
just like you.

727
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:47,966
We'll be able to use that girl
to our advantage in many ways.

728
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:54,556
The food in the lunch box is going to
get all mixed up

729
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,850
if you keep running like this...

730
00:48:57,033 --> 00:48:59,410
Though the same thing's going to happen
once you eat it...

731
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:02,539
We have to hurry,
or we won't be able to catch up.

732
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,984
Besides, what's the point of all this
if he doesn't get to eat it?!

733
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:14,117
I've had it... I can't run anymore.

734
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:17,412
If you can't run,
I'll roll you if I have to!

735
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:18,622
Great idea!

736
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,051
Those eyes...

737
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:33,011
Who are you?

738
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:35,722
Shin Uchiha.

739
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:41,645
My dad and I are supposed to be
the only survivors of the Uchiha Clan.

740
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:45,691
Come with me...

741
00:49:47,725 --> 00:49:49,560
And if I refuse?

742
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:52,990
My father said... to bring you.

743
00:49:53,707 --> 00:49:55,041
His word... absolute!

744
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:04,084
I'm taking you away.

745
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,704
What are you going to do with me
after you kidnap me?!

746
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:15,704
Cho-Cho!

747
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:18,932
<i>Partial Expansion Jutsu!</i>

748
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:26,857
You aren't needed.

749
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:35,073
Isn't this a bit much...

750
00:50:35,098 --> 00:50:36,725
for a kid's fight?

751
00:50:37,166 --> 00:50:38,417
Lord Seventh!

752
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:43,415
I think my village's kids are
well-behaved but...

753
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:48,628
Sharingan...

754
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,381
I see, so you're the one...

755
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:54,217
He treated me so roughly...

756
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:57,637
Sorry, but I'm going to have to
keep you restrained.

757
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,265
I have some questions for you.

758
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:04,644
I see...

759
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,813
Mangekyo Sharingan too.

760
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:12,452
Then I can't go easy on you.

761
00:51:19,492 --> 00:51:21,219
Remote control of weapons...

762
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:24,297
So that's your power.

763
00:51:25,681 --> 00:51:29,027
<i>Naruto... Are we going to
let loose for once?</i>

764
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,903
Just a little.

765
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:38,929
S-Sarada...

766
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:42,724
Is this what they say is inside
Lord Seventh's body?

767
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:45,977
Yeah... The Tailed Beast...

768
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,437
The Nine-Tails' power...

769
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,314
Go easy, okay?

770
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:52,609
<i>What a real pain.</i>

771
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:00,867
Look at all that massive chakra!

772
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,787
And he controls it so accurately!

773
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:09,876
Nicely countered, kid.

774
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:11,837
You're well trained.

775
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:18,552
Wow! I knew that Lord Seventh
was super strong, but...

776
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:21,847
he's even more amazing when
you see him in actual combat!

777
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:24,558
His dazzling presence...

778
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:26,184
Could he be—?

779
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:27,185
What?

780
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:32,899
<i>This is the power of the Nine-Tails
of the Seventh Hokage,</i>

781
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:36,069
<i>known as the greatest shinobi
of his time.</i>

782
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,790
<i>To be able to see
it with these eyes</i>

783
00:52:38,815 --> 00:52:40,540
is an unexpected bonus.

784
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,161
<i>Retreat for now, Shin.</i>

785
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:47,539
<i>You can't take him on yourself.</i>

786
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:56,882
He disappeared...

787
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:58,758
The Transportation Technique?

788
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:07,517
I guess that's it, huh...

789
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:08,685
Um...

790
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:13,190
Could you be my real dad,
Lord Seventh?

791
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:15,859
Huh? What are you saying
all of a sudden?

792
00:53:20,663 --> 00:53:22,248
It's not quite the same.

793
00:53:23,467 --> 00:53:25,761
What's going on?

794
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,872
Anyways, who was that just now?

795
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:33,210
This journey was all about
finding my dad, but...

796
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:36,755
am I like the fair maiden that
everyone's fighting over?!

797
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:38,006
No.

798
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:40,300
You're probably
not their target, Cho-Cho.

799
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:42,510
It's probably Sarada they're after.

800
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:46,872
Who are they?

801
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:49,601
They said they were Uchiha...

802
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:58,276
You don't have to worry
about a thing.

803
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:00,779
I'll protect you.

804
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:10,622
Well... As it is, I can't send you
back to the village.

805
00:54:11,297 --> 00:54:13,007
Both of you, come with me!

806
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:15,377
I think that'll be the safest.

807
00:54:15,477 --> 00:54:17,521
With you?! All right!

808
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:22,050
Actually, I'm on my way to meet with
Sasuke whom I haven't seen in a while.

809
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:26,263
I know he'll probably be happy
to see you too!

810
00:54:30,024 --> 00:54:32,985
Oh yeah! I came to deliver this to you.

811
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:34,271
Oh?

812
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:46,324
Thanks, sorry for the trouble.

813
00:54:51,261 --> 00:54:52,721
That was delicious.

814
00:54:53,681 --> 00:54:56,601
Thanks for bringing it.

815
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:59,587
Oh no, please thank Boruto instead.

816
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:01,447
Okay.

817
00:55:01,565 --> 00:55:03,525
Sarada's dad, huh...

818
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:07,721
Originally, this was supposed to
be a trip to find my dad.

819
00:55:08,755 --> 00:55:10,632
Did Choji go somewhere?

820
00:55:10,856 --> 00:55:13,150
What's your dad like, Sarada?

821
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,937
I've never met him, even once.

822
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,356
I don't remember him.

823
00:55:19,824 --> 00:55:20,825
That's right...

824
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:24,154
He's been out traveling
this whole time.

825
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,326
Let's see here...

826
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:31,202
If I were to describe him...

827
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:37,417
He was always popular with the kunoichi
at the Academy... just like me.

828
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:41,713
And he was quite handsome...
just like me.

829
00:55:42,588 --> 00:55:47,510
Plus, he always got the top grade
in ninjutsu... just like me.

830
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:50,764
Isn't it usually just one top scorer?

831
00:55:50,955 --> 00:55:51,956
Sounds suspect...

832
00:55:53,499 --> 00:55:59,797
But, he was surly, antisocial,
arrogant and rude... totally not like me!

833
00:56:02,433 --> 00:56:03,393
In other words...

834
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,112
He's my rival!

835
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:08,531
And that stands even now!

836
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:11,051
Sarada...

837
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:13,053
Watching you earlier...

838
00:56:13,452 --> 00:56:16,789
reminded me a lot of Sasuke and Sakura
from back in the day.

839
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:17,916
Oh...

840
00:56:18,115 --> 00:56:23,495
Sasuke doesn't wear glasses,
but your eyes are just like his.

841
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:28,551
But your presence is a lot
like Sakura.

842
00:56:28,826 --> 00:56:31,162
Like how you might be really scary
when you snap!

843
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:33,973
Don't worry.

844
00:56:34,407 --> 00:56:37,952
No matter how far apart you are,
or how long you haven't seen him...

845
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:41,356
it doesn't change the fact
that you're his daughter.

846
00:56:44,877 --> 00:56:47,861
And Cho-Cho...
Your face is a mirror of Karui's,

847
00:56:47,886 --> 00:56:50,305
but your physique is just like
Choji's back then!

848
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:52,659
Makes me want to eat meat buns.

849
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:53,827
<i>I wonder why...</i>

850
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:57,205
– <i>When I'm with Lord Seventh...</i>
– Are you okay?

851
00:56:57,288 --> 00:56:58,957
This is nothing!

852
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:02,460
<i>... I feel so relaxed!</i>

853
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:21,354
It's coming into view, ya know!

854
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:24,983
That tower is where I'm supposed
to meet up with Sasuke.

855
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:30,613
I can't anymore! Let's take a break!

856
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:34,824
Guess it can't be helped!
Only for a little bit, okay?

857
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:36,244
Oh, come on...

858
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:38,872
The tower is right there in front of us!

859
00:57:40,532 --> 00:57:43,201
It's okay, Sarada.
Put down your backpack too.

860
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:45,753
Okay.

861
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:51,968
Um... I need to use the toilet.

862
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:56,055
Don't stray too far.

863
00:57:58,349 --> 00:57:59,167
All right.

864
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,630
<i>In just a little bit...</i>

865
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:06,649
<i>I finally get to meet Dad!</i>

866
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:09,986
<i>Dad!</i>

867
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,617
– Dad—!
– I'm impressed that you found me.

868
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:02,472
Are you one of them?

869
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,126
Sarada went
after Naruto?!

870
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:09,337
At least according
to Shikamaru.

871
00:59:09,362 --> 00:59:11,698
Where? Where is she headed?

872
00:59:12,039 --> 00:59:14,333
Who said you can get out of bed?

873
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:17,512
I think she just wants to ask
Sasuke some questions.

874
00:59:18,203 --> 00:59:20,997
She had an old photo of him
with his ex-partners.

875
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:25,812
So, she knows...

876
00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:27,855
about that photo.

877
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:29,816
Can you blame her?

878
00:59:29,907 --> 00:59:32,451
She's old enough to wonder
about her father.

879
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:36,147
I had a feeling that
if Sasuke was nearby,

880
00:59:36,755 --> 00:59:39,341
she'd get embroiled
in conflicts too.

881
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:42,704
I mean...

882
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:46,791
the Sharingan can
also draw in sadness.

883
01:00:03,023 --> 01:00:03,832
Dad!

884
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,229
You're...

885
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:11,524
Sarada?

886
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:15,862
Uh-huh.

887
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:23,636
I see...

888
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:28,291
I knew right away...

889
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,168
that you were my dad.

890
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:41,346
There you are!

891
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:44,374
Sarada, why'd you run off
like that?

892
01:00:44,549 --> 01:00:45,174
Oh!

893
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:48,061
So handsome!

894
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:51,789
Sorry I'm a little late, Sasuke.

895
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:54,400
Naruto, what's going on?

896
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,593
Why did you bring
children with you—?!

897
01:00:57,763 --> 01:01:02,950
This feels right, but maybe
the touch was a bit firmer?

898
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:04,619
What's going on?

899
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:07,455
I came...

900
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:10,792
I came to see you, Dad!

901
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:16,047
I found out Lord Seventh
was meeting up with you,

902
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:18,299
so I followed him.

903
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:21,485
There's something
I really want to ask you.

904
01:01:21,911 --> 01:01:23,245
Something you want to ask me?

905
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:24,781
Yes.

906
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:28,142
Um... Well...

907
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:34,732
Is Mom... my real mom?

908
01:01:36,892 --> 01:01:37,935
I see...

909
01:01:38,128 --> 01:01:40,630
So Sarada's had the Sharingan
for that long?

910
01:01:41,873 --> 01:01:45,585
Emotional trauma triggers
the awakening of the Sharingan.

911
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:49,021
Perhaps without knowing,

912
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:55,170
Sasuke's absence affected
her deeply.

913
01:01:57,964 --> 01:01:59,465
Judging by your reaction,

914
01:01:59,582 --> 01:02:02,668
you didn't tell her about the others
in the old photo either?

915
01:02:05,212 --> 01:02:07,339
Sarada is very conscientious.

916
01:02:08,223 --> 01:02:09,308
If she ever found out that

917
01:02:09,333 --> 01:02:12,044
Sasuke was an enemy of
the Hidden Leaf at one time...

918
01:02:13,387 --> 01:02:17,666
But now, he's traveling around
the world for the good of the village.

919
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:20,862
Even if you kept it secret,
she would find out eventually.

920
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:25,032
It was the same even
when she was born.

921
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,737
Maybe you should have
more faith in Sarada?

922
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:36,419
I'm a failure as a mother.

923
01:02:37,577 --> 01:02:38,828
Please answer me.

924
01:02:39,029 --> 01:02:41,031
Is she my real mom?

925
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:42,967
What happened?

926
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:47,930
What happened?!

927
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,334
You're never around!

928
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:53,653
Why won't you stay and
live with Mom?

929
01:02:53,678 --> 01:02:56,889
Do you even care that
you've forgotten your daughter's face?!

930
01:02:57,098 --> 01:03:01,109
Who's this woman next to you
wearing the same kind of glasses as me?!

931
01:03:01,402 --> 01:03:04,989
Do you think this is something
a daughter can ask her mom?

932
01:03:05,656 --> 01:03:07,866
Hey... that photo is—?

933
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:11,370
I'm really not into situations
like these.

934
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:14,889
Mom doesn't say anything,
and you're never around.

935
01:03:14,914 --> 01:03:16,791
I can't trust either one of you...

936
01:03:16,951 --> 01:03:18,494
This whole thing is a mess!

937
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:26,552
Where have you been and exactly what
have you been doing all this time, Dad?!

938
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:32,517
It has nothing...
to do with you.

939
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:41,734
Just forget it!

940
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:44,070
Hey!

941
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:48,115
That was way too insensitive
of you!

942
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:51,536
I thought for a moment that
you might be my dad,

943
01:03:52,018 --> 01:03:53,445
but that's impossible!

944
01:03:56,783 --> 01:04:00,161
Don't you think you should
tell Sarada at least?

945
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:03,339
About why you won't return
to the village.

946
01:04:15,668 --> 01:04:17,002
<i>Are you leaving already?</i>

947
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:20,273
<i>I'll send word if I find anything.</i>

948
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:24,151
<i>It wouldn't hurt to stop
by your house, would it?</i>

949
01:04:24,593 --> 01:04:26,595
<i>The existence of a threat
like Kaguya,</i>

950
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:29,115
<i>who nearly destroyed the world,</i>

951
01:04:29,239 --> 01:04:31,742
<i>could arise again if
we're not diligent.</i>

952
01:04:32,777 --> 01:04:35,070
<i>We can't afford to ignore
any trace of it.</i>

953
01:04:36,381 --> 01:04:40,677
<i>It was a peace that was secured
through huge sacrifices, after all.</i>

954
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:44,964
<i>This is... also a journey
of atonement for me.</i>

955
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:49,635
<i>No one has any bitterness
toward you anymore.</i>

956
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:53,347
<i>Come on, Sasuke,
together we can...</i>

957
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:55,600
<i>You protect the village as the Hokage.</i>

958
01:04:56,350 --> 01:04:58,769
<i>I'm the only one,
with my Rinnegan,</i>

959
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,646
<i>who can search for traces of Kaguya.</i>

960
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:04,025
<i>You do what you're meant to do.</i>

961
01:05:04,542 --> 01:05:06,409
<i>And I'll do what I'm meant to.</i>

962
01:05:07,094 --> 01:05:09,930
<i>Isn't this the collaboration
you always wanted?</i>

963
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:14,535
<i>Listen, treat my movements</i>

964
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:17,997
<i>as a top secret mission that
only the top brass know about.</i>

965
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:22,376
<i>Not knowing anything hurts,
you know.</i>

966
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:25,630
<i>Sarada should, at least...</i>

967
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:28,674
<i>Knowing will only create
unnecessary anxiety.</i>

968
01:05:29,216 --> 01:05:31,761
<i>She may resent you some day.</i>

969
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:36,307
<i>Even if she does,
the future ought to stay bright.</i>

970
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:38,225
<i>Am I wrong?</i>

971
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:44,065
She has Sakura.

972
01:05:45,241 --> 01:05:46,242
There's nothing to worry about.

973
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:57,870
I'm really not good...

974
01:05:57,912 --> 01:06:00,498
at dealing with stifling situations
like this.

975
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:11,400
Okay, after I eat this,

976
01:06:11,425 --> 01:06:13,552
I'm going to really try talking to her.

977
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:25,213
Sarada, could you
at least believe this?

978
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:30,319
Your father is
the finest shinobi around.

979
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:48,796
Sakura, after this test,
the next one will...

980
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:51,799
That girl!

981
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:11,444
For the purpose of our goals,
let it begin...

982
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:18,367
the revival of the Akatsuki.

983
01:07:22,955 --> 01:07:23,914
– Yes.
– Yes.

984
01:07:57,323 --> 01:07:58,115
Here.

985
01:07:58,991 --> 01:07:59,825
What is it?

986
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:01,535
It's consommé flavor.

987
01:08:01,702 --> 01:08:05,289
You can have it,
so use it to make up with Sarada.

988
01:08:09,668 --> 01:08:11,212
Wait, Sarada!

989
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:12,963
Please let me go!

990
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:15,674
If no one will tell me the truth,

991
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:18,260
I'll go find that woman with
the glasses myself,

992
01:08:18,302 --> 01:08:20,179
and ask her to her face!

993
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:23,099
Go talk to Sasuke one more time!

994
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,240
Let's go, Shin!

995
01:08:39,306 --> 01:08:40,391
Yes... Father.

996
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:11,689
I leave it to you... Sasuke!

997
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:17,903
Dad!

998
01:09:47,924 --> 01:09:50,051
<i>Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!</i>

999
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:59,069
Is that his visual prowess?

1000
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:12,666
Dad's amazing!

1001
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:16,253
Yeah... But this is nothing.

1002
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:20,032
Man, if only my real dad
had piercing eyes and

1003
01:10:20,057 --> 01:10:23,269
was a "make-the-ladies-swoon" type... yup.

1004
01:10:26,271 --> 01:10:29,122
I see... Sasuke Uchiha.

1005
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:34,647
That's something I definitely want
in order to revive the Akatsuki.

1006
01:10:34,938 --> 01:10:35,981
Akatsuki?

1007
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:37,816
Who are you?

1008
01:10:39,768 --> 01:10:43,230
My name is... Shin Uchiha.

1009
01:10:43,697 --> 01:10:46,575
Shin Uchiha? That's...

1010
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:54,667
<i>Those eyes...</i>

1011
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:57,044
<i>Who are you?</i>

1012
01:10:57,544 --> 01:10:59,463
<i>Shin Uchiha.</i>

1013
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:03,509
The same name as that boy?!

1014
01:11:04,718 --> 01:11:07,596
You can speak the truth at leisure
after we've captured you.

1015
01:11:08,013 --> 01:11:09,556
Until then, shut up.

1016
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:13,060
Who told you to rest? Stand up.

1017
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,880
Yes... Father.

1018
01:11:16,763 --> 01:11:18,432
Are they father and son?

1019
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:22,069
He's using his own son
as a shield?

1020
01:11:26,573 --> 01:11:29,033
Naruto, take care of Sarada.

1021
01:11:29,526 --> 01:11:30,611
Sure.

1022
01:11:30,636 --> 01:11:32,512
As long as she's in here,
they can't touch her.

1023
01:11:32,954 --> 01:11:34,706
Be careful and don't
let down your guard.

1024
01:11:48,228 --> 01:11:50,146
Wh-What?!

1025
01:11:57,563 --> 01:11:58,731
What's going on?!

1026
01:12:01,107 --> 01:12:03,318
This is my visual prowess.

1027
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:04,945
Well?

1028
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:07,823
Just as good as yours, huh?

1029
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:11,702
Lord Seventh!

1030
01:12:11,777 --> 01:12:13,570
Don't worry, Sarada.

1031
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:14,997
I'm okay.

1032
01:12:16,223 --> 01:12:18,725
That guy's able to control
other people's weapons...

1033
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:20,501
with his visual prowess!

1034
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:22,838
<i>That moment...</i>

1035
01:12:26,324 --> 01:12:28,451
<i>he marked my sword!</i>

1036
01:12:44,776 --> 01:12:45,693
Dad!

1037
01:12:48,580 --> 01:12:51,624
Peace keeps humans
from evolving.

1038
01:12:52,125 --> 01:12:54,627
Just like it has with you two!

1039
01:12:57,456 --> 01:12:59,625
He's inhibiting my movement
with these!

1040
01:13:00,442 --> 01:13:03,028
Without evolution,
creatures shall eventually perish!

1041
01:13:03,854 --> 01:13:07,049
So, I'm taking... your Sharingan!

1042
01:13:11,419 --> 01:13:13,964
Cha, damn it!

1043
01:13:16,683 --> 01:13:17,726
Mom?!

1044
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:38,231
What do you think you're doing to
my husband and beloved daughter?!

1045
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:41,333
So... who the hell are these guys?!

1046
01:13:42,058 --> 01:13:44,519
We're about to figure it out...

1047
01:13:45,178 --> 01:13:46,513
What are you doing here, too?

1048
01:13:47,830 --> 01:13:49,874
I'm here too, you know...

1049
01:13:50,867 --> 01:13:54,121
What the hell are these people?

1050
01:13:55,289 --> 01:13:57,124
Are you okay, Naruto?

1051
01:13:57,357 --> 01:13:58,191
Yeah...

1052
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:02,120
I'll heal up soon enough.

1053
01:14:02,145 --> 01:14:03,897
<i>Huh? For real?!</i>

1054
01:14:08,193 --> 01:14:10,904
<i>So much fuss over
something like this.</i>

1055
01:14:11,088 --> 01:14:15,008
<i>Your battle senses have dulled!
How pathetic...</i>

1056
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:17,327
Aw c'mon...

1057
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:19,997
However... it's over.

1058
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:55,532
Thank goodness, you're okay!

1059
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:57,117
Huh?!

1060
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:15,427
I'm sorry, I thought I'd made things
clear to Sarada, but...

1061
01:15:18,138 --> 01:15:20,891
No, it's my fault.

1062
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:23,352
You don't need to apologize.

1063
01:15:24,351 --> 01:15:25,936
But I've...

1064
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:37,366
Sarada!

1065
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:38,200
What?

1066
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,002
<i>I'm taking you along as well.</i>

1067
01:15:49,127 --> 01:15:50,379
Wh-What's going on?!

1068
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:52,297
Sarada!

1069
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:57,803
Transportation?

1070
01:15:57,977 --> 01:15:58,994
Mom!

1071
01:16:07,187 --> 01:16:11,191
Mom...!

1072
01:16:33,463 --> 01:16:36,133
Looks like I'm right in the heart
of enemy territory, huh?

1073
01:16:37,509 --> 01:16:38,468
It's no use...

1074
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:43,307
They either went really far away,
or escaped inside a barrier...

1075
01:16:44,398 --> 01:16:46,484
I can't sense Sakura's chakra at all...

1076
01:16:48,244 --> 01:16:49,195
Sarada...

1077
01:16:50,814 --> 01:16:51,673
Mom!

1078
01:16:56,002 --> 01:16:58,045
Don't take your eyes off of her.

1079
01:16:58,822 --> 01:17:00,073
– Yes, Father.
– Yes, Father.

1080
01:17:02,659 --> 01:17:04,369
Please behave...

1081
01:17:05,162 --> 01:17:09,916
You are not of Uchiha blood,
but we can still use you.

1082
01:17:09,941 --> 01:17:12,193
That's the only reason
why I'm letting you live.

1083
01:17:14,996 --> 01:17:17,999
You didn't hold back, did you?

1084
01:17:18,216 --> 01:17:20,886
It's because you tried to kill
my husband and child!

1085
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:23,597
As well as my dear friend!

1086
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:27,476
That child needs medical attention
immediately, or he'll be in danger.

1087
01:17:27,851 --> 01:17:28,977
I'll help.

1088
01:17:29,895 --> 01:17:33,523
You don't want to lose
your child, do you?

1089
01:17:34,482 --> 01:17:35,733
My child?

1090
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:37,694
Don't misunderstand...

1091
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:42,574
These children are clones, created
by culturing my teeth and nerves.

1092
01:17:44,242 --> 01:17:46,453
Clones? That's...

1093
01:17:47,036 --> 01:17:49,080
That's just like him...

1094
01:17:51,099 --> 01:17:52,642
Yes, that's right...

1095
01:17:53,585 --> 01:17:55,170
My master was...

1096
01:17:57,714 --> 01:17:59,341
Orochimaru.

1097
01:18:05,555 --> 01:18:06,556
What are you—?!

1098
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:11,395
S-Stop it!

1099
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:27,869
Orochimaru?

1100
01:18:27,894 --> 01:18:30,396
Yes, Kakashi-sensei
said the same thing.

1101
01:18:30,747 --> 01:18:34,418
He felt the enemy this time
could be connected to Orochimaru.

1102
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:36,586
Who's that?

1103
01:18:37,295 --> 01:18:38,922
I've heard of him before.

1104
01:18:39,163 --> 01:18:40,824
He's a notorious criminal who tried to

1105
01:18:40,849 --> 01:18:43,351
destroy Hidden Leaf Village
a long time ago.

1106
01:18:44,369 --> 01:18:46,663
He's a tremendously
dangerous individual.

1107
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:50,142
That guy who called himself
Shin Uchiha...

1108
01:18:50,408 --> 01:18:51,158
Huh?

1109
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:55,564
His left arm was implanted
with multiple Sharingan.

1110
01:18:56,273 --> 01:19:00,026
The only one capable of doing
something like that is Orochimaru.

1111
01:19:00,193 --> 01:19:01,528
So then,

1112
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:05,198
Sarada's mom was taken
to this Orochimaru guy's place?

1113
01:19:05,282 --> 01:19:06,992
No... that's not possible.

1114
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:11,747
We have Leaf shinobi keeping
strict surveillance on him.

1115
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:15,959
I don't believe he would be
directly involved in this, ya know?

1116
01:19:16,419 --> 01:19:18,920
However, in order to
track Shin's whereabouts,

1117
01:19:18,952 --> 01:19:22,122
we need to find out all
we can from Orochimaru.

1118
01:19:22,841 --> 01:19:24,593
Let's head to his research lab.

1119
01:19:25,218 --> 01:19:26,052
Dad!

1120
01:19:26,845 --> 01:19:28,263
S-Sarada?

1121
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:30,223
What is it?

1122
01:19:30,682 --> 01:19:33,477
How can you be so calm?

1123
01:19:33,860 --> 01:19:35,971
Aren't you worried about Mom?

1124
01:19:35,996 --> 01:19:37,998
Hey, Sarada, Sasuke is...

1125
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:42,360
Personal feelings only get
in the way of a mission.

1126
01:19:42,918 --> 01:19:44,962
If you intend on becoming
a shinobi, remember that.

1127
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:52,287
I only have...
lightly salted chips left, but...

1128
01:19:52,745 --> 01:19:55,540
<i>I totally hate intense,
heavy situations like this!</i>

1129
01:19:55,999 --> 01:19:59,377
<i>The only thing heavy should
be my weight!</i>

1130
01:19:59,836 --> 01:20:02,130
<i>You can do this,
my delicate heart of glass!</i>

1131
01:20:02,647 --> 01:20:03,523
Cho-Cho...

1132
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:05,050
All right!

1133
01:20:05,075 --> 01:20:08,370
Do the two of you want
to come with us?

1134
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:10,931
Naruto, what are you—?!

1135
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:14,184
They came after Sarada too.

1136
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:17,521
It's safer to stay together.

1137
01:20:18,630 --> 01:20:19,715
Do what you want.

1138
01:20:21,641 --> 01:20:25,145
Besides, we may be able to see
those people in the photo

1139
01:20:25,170 --> 01:20:26,755
at Orochimaru's.

1140
01:20:26,879 --> 01:20:27,588
What?!

1141
01:20:28,573 --> 01:20:30,075
Okay, it's decided.

1142
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:32,661
We'll set out at daybreak.

1143
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:38,750
How horrible!

1144
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:40,961
Even if they're clones,

1145
01:20:41,044 --> 01:20:43,004
didn't you raise them like
they're your sons?

1146
01:20:43,463 --> 01:20:46,716
They're just stand-ins
for my organs.

1147
01:20:46,741 --> 01:20:49,035
Nothing more, nothing less.

1148
01:20:49,427 --> 01:20:51,513
There's no need to grieve.

1149
01:20:51,621 --> 01:20:54,791
Living creatures don't truly die.

1150
01:20:55,433 --> 01:20:56,643
What do you mean?!

1151
01:20:56,852 --> 01:20:58,979
Without a doubt,

1152
01:20:59,062 --> 01:21:01,356
the body of every living creature
decomposes in time.

1153
01:21:01,381 --> 01:21:04,467
However, genes through
reproductive cells survive forever

1154
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:07,862
without change in
the shape of progeny.

1155
01:21:08,421 --> 01:21:11,549
That is the system we call life.

1156
01:21:11,825 --> 01:21:13,827
What is that which we call death?

1157
01:21:13,852 --> 01:21:18,816
It's merely the expiration of
the disposable corporeal vessel.

1158
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,250
You're wrong!

1159
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:25,463
You're wrong in thinking
the body is just a vessel!

1160
01:21:25,964 --> 01:21:28,925
That's where one's feelings
and will reside!

1161
01:21:29,342 --> 01:21:30,969
What exists between
parent and child

1162
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:33,430
is more than mere gene transmission,

1163
01:21:33,471 --> 01:21:34,565
much more!

1164
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:43,356
Genes are the essence of life.

1165
01:21:43,773 --> 01:21:45,976
Weak genes perish,

1166
01:21:46,001 --> 01:21:50,840
and strong genes hybridize
to create stronger beings.

1167
01:21:51,055 --> 01:21:52,932
That is evolution.

1168
01:21:53,124 --> 01:21:54,918
You don't understand at all

1169
01:21:54,943 --> 01:21:58,280
what should be important
as a parent!

1170
01:22:00,565 --> 01:22:02,317
For evolution,

1171
01:22:02,391 --> 01:22:07,230
conflict is essential in the further
selection of superior genes.

1172
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:09,758
Through countless battles,

1173
01:22:09,783 --> 01:22:12,775
new ninjutsu and other arts
were developed rapidly...

1174
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:15,469
and strong shinobi were selected!

1175
01:22:16,164 --> 01:22:17,540
In the past,

1176
01:22:17,565 --> 01:22:21,819
the organization known as
the Akatsuki stirred up such conflict!

1177
01:22:22,820 --> 01:22:27,575
For the sake of human evolution,
I will revive the Akatsuki...

1178
01:22:27,817 --> 01:22:30,862
and carry out the wishes
of Itachi Uchiha!

1179
01:22:34,824 --> 01:22:37,744
It's been awhile, Captain Yamato.

1180
01:22:38,453 --> 01:22:39,371
Please stop that.

1181
01:22:39,871 --> 01:22:42,457
I don't want to be called
"Captain" by the Hokage.

1182
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:44,709
I can't help it...

1183
01:22:44,893 --> 01:22:47,729
You'll always be
Captain Yamato to me.

1184
01:22:48,054 --> 01:22:50,181
<i>He's definitely not my dad.</i>

1185
01:22:51,541 --> 01:22:54,252
<i>So, they're Orochimaru's partners.</i>

1186
01:22:55,053 --> 01:22:58,014
<i>But why's Dad in
the photo with them?</i>

1187
01:23:03,853 --> 01:23:08,107
<i>I guess, I really don't know
anything about Dad...</i>

1188
01:23:09,292 --> 01:23:11,711
Lord Sixth filled me in
for the most part...

1189
01:23:12,612 --> 01:23:16,157
But I'm sorry, this is my mission
and can't leave this spot.

1190
01:23:16,616 --> 01:23:17,659
I understand.

1191
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:21,454
Sasuke will lead from here.

1192
01:23:21,804 --> 01:23:22,680
Follow me.

1193
01:23:28,737 --> 01:23:29,696
This way.

1194
01:23:31,506 --> 01:23:32,757
H-Hey, Sasuke!

1195
01:23:33,174 --> 01:23:35,969
It's not like we're going to
one of your favorite restaurants here.

1196
01:23:36,052 --> 01:23:38,179
Be more on guard, will ya?

1197
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:41,433
Damn it! See?!

1198
01:23:42,575 --> 01:23:44,118
Been a while, Sasuke.

1199
01:23:47,005 --> 01:23:48,340
<i>The guys in the photo!</i>

1200
01:23:49,307 --> 01:23:53,019
This isn't the kind of place
you bring kids for a field trip...

1201
01:23:54,370 --> 01:23:55,204
The Hokage?

1202
01:23:55,647 --> 01:23:58,733
Good timing. Take us to him.

1203
01:23:59,258 --> 01:24:02,386
Huh? Hold on.
Are you ordering us around?

1204
01:24:02,662 --> 01:24:04,122
Shall I take you to him?

1205
01:24:06,966 --> 01:24:11,596
Sasuke, looks like
that won't be necessary.

1206
01:24:19,262 --> 01:24:22,265
Oh my... We have an unusual visitor.

1207
01:24:23,641 --> 01:24:24,809
Orochimaru.

1208
01:24:28,271 --> 01:24:30,732
Orochimaru...
So this is the person...

1209
01:24:30,982 --> 01:24:34,027
Hey, you look younger
than before.

1210
01:24:34,235 --> 01:24:36,404
You should know me by now.

1211
01:24:37,113 --> 01:24:40,366
So don't keep prodding at it,
would you?

1212
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:43,703
H-He's different from
what I imagined.

1213
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:49,250
Hey, so if this person
is my parent...

1214
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:51,628
Would he be my mom or dad?

1215
01:24:52,045 --> 01:24:53,755
Which? Which one, Sarada?!

1216
01:24:53,963 --> 01:24:54,964
Huh?!

1217
01:24:56,007 --> 01:24:58,301
My child's life was
endangered and

1218
01:24:58,384 --> 01:25:01,721
my wife was kidnapped by a man
who seemed like an underling of yours.

1219
01:25:02,764 --> 01:25:06,476
If you're up to something,
spill it now.

1220
01:25:07,727 --> 01:25:11,022
I wonder...
Have I done something suspicious?

1221
01:25:11,648 --> 01:25:13,650
What's the watcher outside for?

1222
01:25:13,983 --> 01:25:17,821
Then explain the man
who calls himself Shin Uchiha.

1223
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:23,118
Let's go to another room.
Come along.

1224
01:25:25,978 --> 01:25:26,895
Shin...

1225
01:25:27,047 --> 01:25:28,882
I haven't heard that name
in a while.

1226
01:25:29,282 --> 01:25:33,494
He's gone off on his own already,
but he was one of my old experiments.

1227
01:25:35,271 --> 01:25:38,607
Danzo Shimura,
the man you all fought...

1228
01:25:38,917 --> 01:25:41,260
his right arm came from Shin.

1229
01:25:42,011 --> 01:25:44,272
That child possessed
a peculiar trait

1230
01:25:44,297 --> 01:25:48,259
where his body wouldn't reject
any kind of tissue transplant.

1231
01:25:49,018 --> 01:25:51,938
He was the optimum subject
for cloning experiments.

1232
01:25:52,689 --> 01:25:53,773
Cloning?

1233
01:25:53,914 --> 01:25:57,585
To put it in simpler terms for you...

1234
01:25:58,069 --> 01:26:00,738
He was like a Shadow Clone
that never disappears.

1235
01:26:01,114 --> 01:26:02,949
Never disappears?

1236
01:26:03,174 --> 01:26:05,593
So once you're done,
what happens to them?

1237
01:26:05,869 --> 01:26:07,245
If you want them to disappear...

1238
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:09,455
your only option is to kill them.

1239
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:13,710
Humans aren't simple things like that!

1240
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:18,298
Humans are much simpler
than you think.

1241
01:26:19,048 --> 01:26:22,051
Humans are practically slaves
to their genes.

1242
01:26:22,927 --> 01:26:25,597
For example, take you, Sasuke.

1243
01:26:25,738 --> 01:26:28,783
The reason why your daughter
looks like you

1244
01:26:28,874 --> 01:26:31,043
is because your genes
were passed on to her.

1245
01:26:31,519 --> 01:26:33,563
Everything about her
is simply data

1246
01:26:33,646 --> 01:26:35,523
that was recorded into her genes.

1247
01:26:36,156 --> 01:26:37,425
<i>Genes!</i>

1248
01:26:37,901 --> 01:26:40,320
Hey, that's not a nice way to put it!

1249
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:42,864
Why does he call himself
an Uchiha?

1250
01:26:43,448 --> 01:26:46,451
Oh, that's just him
proclaiming that himself.

1251
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:49,729
Granted, he's a reproduction, but as
someone who possesses the Sharingan,

1252
01:26:49,754 --> 01:26:52,924
he was obsessed with
the Uchiha name.

1253
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:55,059
In particular,

1254
01:26:55,084 --> 01:27:00,214
with your late brother, Itachi Uchiha.

1255
01:27:00,882 --> 01:27:02,008
I see...

1256
01:27:02,592 --> 01:27:05,011
I understand Shin's background now.

1257
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:07,555
Do you know his whereabouts?

1258
01:27:07,847 --> 01:27:10,934
Oh my, such one-sided questioning!

1259
01:27:11,142 --> 01:27:13,895
You've become quite shameless.

1260
01:27:16,606 --> 01:27:18,149
Well, anyway...

1261
01:27:18,191 --> 01:27:19,776
It would benefit me as well

1262
01:27:19,801 --> 01:27:23,180
if the Leaf were to capture
that troublesome Shin.

1263
01:27:23,713 --> 01:27:24,798
Besides...

1264
01:27:24,989 --> 01:27:27,992
I kind of owe you one, right, Naruto?

1265
01:27:28,993 --> 01:27:31,996
How is the child doing?
Well, I hope.

1266
01:27:32,413 --> 01:27:35,541
Yeah, the kid seems to be doing well.

1267
01:27:36,234 --> 01:27:38,402
Really? That's great.

1268
01:27:40,838 --> 01:27:44,050
I'll explain more, come along.

1269
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:47,887
Um...

1270
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:51,140
You're all
my dad's former partners, right?

1271
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:53,101
I guess.

1272
01:27:53,518 --> 01:27:54,602
Then...

1273
01:27:55,228 --> 01:27:57,188
Can you tell me where
this woman is?

1274
01:27:59,064 --> 01:28:00,733
Oh, Karin...

1275
01:28:00,984 --> 01:28:03,903
She's at a different hideout.
She's not here.

1276
01:28:05,071 --> 01:28:06,281
I see...

1277
01:28:07,156 --> 01:28:10,785
Then... could I ask you
one other favor?

1278
01:28:17,875 --> 01:28:19,252
No way!

1279
01:28:19,294 --> 01:28:22,005
I didn't know Sasuke was that
much of a scummy bastard!

1280
01:28:25,008 --> 01:28:27,135
Could Karin actually have...?

1281
01:28:27,218 --> 01:28:30,763
Well, right now, it's still only
a possibility!

1282
01:28:30,847 --> 01:28:35,351
A genetic test would show
whose child I am, right?

1283
01:28:38,438 --> 01:28:41,357
That's funny. I could've sworn
it was around here...

1284
01:28:42,692 --> 01:28:43,651
Found it!

1285
01:28:49,365 --> 01:28:50,533
All right.

1286
01:28:50,742 --> 01:28:52,952
We'll compare the genes
that we harvested from you

1287
01:28:53,036 --> 01:28:55,747
with the genes from
Karin's umbilical cord.

1288
01:28:57,832 --> 01:28:59,208
Okay, here we go.

1289
01:29:20,146 --> 01:29:23,566
Seems your mom is definitely Karin.

1290
01:29:29,822 --> 01:29:33,201
<i>Your dad and I are connected
through our feelings,</i>

1291
01:29:33,284 --> 01:29:34,410
<i>so don't worry!</i>

1292
01:29:35,077 --> 01:29:36,995
Well, you have similar glasses too...

1293
01:29:40,099 --> 01:29:43,185
Uh, anyway... I have to go!

1294
01:29:50,134 --> 01:29:53,846
I kinda feel like I did something
I shouldn't have...

1295
01:29:54,263 --> 01:29:55,723
Since the old days,

1296
01:29:56,015 --> 01:29:59,232
you guys have always
messed things up!

1297
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:00,770
You idiot!

1298
01:30:01,104 --> 01:30:02,939
Isn't Sasuke the one at fault?

1299
01:30:03,272 --> 01:30:05,316
Did you even know about this?

1300
01:30:05,533 --> 01:30:07,118
Of course not!

1301
01:30:07,819 --> 01:30:10,029
Sasuke, that bastard!

1302
01:30:10,154 --> 01:30:12,323
Well, you take it from here!

1303
01:30:13,574 --> 01:30:14,951
Hey, Suigetsu!

1304
01:30:15,118 --> 01:30:15,743
Wait—!

1305
01:30:21,124 --> 01:30:23,084
U-Um... Sarada...

1306
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,673
We need to go and rescue
your mom... right?

1307
01:30:30,341 --> 01:30:31,426
Liar...

1308
01:30:32,809 --> 01:30:34,645
You lied to me, Lord Seventh!

1309
01:30:35,012 --> 01:30:39,133
Why do I have to go and rescue
someone who's not even my mom?!

1310
01:30:40,191 --> 01:30:43,153
I'm done with people
who've lied to me...

1311
01:30:44,021 --> 01:30:45,440
all my life!

1312
01:30:57,952 --> 01:31:01,372
At this point, I'd rather not look
like that person at all.

1313
01:31:02,665 --> 01:31:03,958
What are you going to do?

1314
01:31:05,126 --> 01:31:08,171
This has nothing to do with you,
Lord Seventh.

1315
01:31:13,426 --> 01:31:14,552
What is it?!

1316
01:31:16,345 --> 01:31:18,639
Nothing to do with me, huh?

1317
01:31:19,389 --> 01:31:21,350
Well, it just doesn't work
that way.

1318
01:31:21,893 --> 01:31:24,479
I've told Boruto the same thing
time and time again.

1319
01:31:24,729 --> 01:31:29,358
To a Hokage,
everyone in the village is family.

1320
01:31:33,370 --> 01:31:34,955
So what?!

1321
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:37,825
Isn't that just a convenient excuse?!

1322
01:31:38,242 --> 01:31:40,494
Dad's away from the village
so much.

1323
01:31:40,694 --> 01:31:43,280
He even forgot
his own daughter's face.

1324
01:31:43,915 --> 01:31:44,957
And Mom...

1325
01:31:45,749 --> 01:31:47,793
She's been lying
to me this whole time!

1326
01:31:47,919 --> 01:31:48,820
Plus...

1327
01:31:49,753 --> 01:31:52,547
we're not even related
by blood at all.

1328
01:31:56,610 --> 01:32:02,533
I know now that I don't
have a real family.

1329
01:32:03,059 --> 01:32:06,187
And... you're not me, Lord Seventh.

1330
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:09,607
So you can't understand
what I feel in my heart.

1331
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:12,860
You and I are not family!

1332
01:32:38,219 --> 01:32:42,932
Is that the extent of your bond
with your mom and dad?

1333
01:32:44,283 --> 01:32:47,744
Bonds aren't just about
history or blood.

1334
01:32:48,212 --> 01:32:50,005
It's something much stronger!

1335
01:32:50,273 --> 01:32:52,567
Then tell me! What is it?!

1336
01:32:53,526 --> 01:32:54,694
Feelings of love.

1337
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:57,154
That's all you really need.

1338
01:32:58,872 --> 01:33:00,123
Nothing more.

1339
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:04,829
So check yourself again
to see if you feel any.

1340
01:33:24,724 --> 01:33:26,058
<i>Hey...</i>

1341
01:33:26,083 --> 01:33:28,294
<i>When is Dad coming home?</i>

1342
01:33:28,935 --> 01:33:30,778
<i>He's out doing really difficult work,</i>

1343
01:33:30,830 --> 01:33:32,832
<i>so he can't come home right away.</i>

1344
01:33:33,316 --> 01:33:37,528
<i>Doesn't Dad care
about you and me?</i>

1345
01:33:37,869 --> 01:33:40,163
<i>What? Don't ever think that!</i>

1346
01:33:40,348 --> 01:33:42,683
<i>Then why doesn't he come home?</i>

1347
01:33:43,959 --> 01:33:48,297
<i>Sarada...
Dad treasures us both deeply.</i>

1348
01:33:48,831 --> 01:33:51,042
<i>That's why he can't come home.</i>

1349
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:53,711
<i>You may not get it right now...</i>

1350
01:33:54,086 --> 01:33:57,048
<i>but I know one day
you'll understand.</i>

1351
01:34:01,927 --> 01:34:04,096
<i>Mom, you're squishing me!</i>

1352
01:34:04,221 --> 01:34:05,640
<i>I-I'm sorry!</i>

1353
01:34:05,723 --> 01:34:09,143
<i>I can't help it because
you're so precious!</i>

1354
01:34:10,019 --> 01:34:12,730
<i>Mom, have you ever kissed Dad?</i>

1355
01:34:12,938 --> 01:34:13,981
<i>Huh?!</i>

1356
01:34:17,568 --> 01:34:19,403
<i>What? What's the matter?</i>

1357
01:34:19,428 --> 01:34:23,098
<i>Nothing... I was just remembering
something even better...</i>

1358
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:24,617
<i>Mom... that's pervy.</i>

1359
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:26,619
<i>No! Not that!</i>

1360
01:34:26,693 --> 01:34:30,197
<i>Then tell me!
What was better than a kiss?!</i>

1361
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:34,335
<i>I'll tell you next time.</i>

1362
01:34:36,212 --> 01:34:38,339
<i>I think you'll understand
when you see your dad.</i>

1363
01:34:41,258 --> 01:34:42,551
Mom!

1364
01:34:47,139 --> 01:34:50,518
I guess I do want to rescue Mom!

1365
01:34:52,018 --> 01:34:52,894
Oh yeah?

1366
01:34:54,104 --> 01:34:57,691
But... it won't be like before...

1367
01:34:58,693 --> 01:35:01,028
What am I supposed to do?

1368
01:35:03,781 --> 01:35:08,536
It doesn't matter whether
she's fake or real.

1369
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:11,580
As long as you feel
the desire to save her.

1370
01:35:12,056 --> 01:35:13,932
That's what's real!

1371
01:35:15,543 --> 01:35:17,503
Let's go rescue your mom.

1372
01:35:19,088 --> 01:35:19,839
Yeah!

1373
01:35:23,016 --> 01:35:24,434
Oh, there they are!

1374
01:35:24,926 --> 01:35:25,927
Sarada!

1375
01:35:26,102 --> 01:35:28,396
Where have you two been?

1376
01:35:32,017 --> 01:35:33,519
Sasuke!

1377
01:35:33,736 --> 01:35:36,864
We have to discuss something later.

1378
01:35:38,107 --> 01:35:39,150
What about?

1379
01:35:39,191 --> 01:35:40,484
Not now!

1380
01:35:40,776 --> 01:35:43,028
First, we're going to rescue Sakura!

1381
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:45,781
She might be dead already,
you know.

1382
01:35:47,616 --> 01:35:49,785
My wife's not weak.

1383
01:35:52,413 --> 01:35:56,792
But I will thank you for
telling me where he is.

1384
01:35:58,043 --> 01:35:59,795
I'll take everyone there.

1385
01:36:00,254 --> 01:36:02,506
My visual prowess just came back.

1386
01:36:06,093 --> 01:36:08,888
Your visual prowess was diminished?

1387
01:36:09,054 --> 01:36:10,264
That explains things...

1388
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:13,559
You have no right to criticize.

1389
01:36:15,811 --> 01:36:17,188
Everyone, get on.

1390
01:36:18,230 --> 01:36:20,566
In order to revive the Akatsuki,

1391
01:36:20,649 --> 01:36:24,612
I will kill Sasuke and take
his Sharingan.

1392
01:36:25,119 --> 01:36:28,581
He does not deserve to
carry on the Uchiha name.

1393
01:36:28,824 --> 01:36:30,785
The one who does...

1394
01:36:30,826 --> 01:36:32,787
is me, Shin Uchiha!

1395
01:36:44,256 --> 01:36:47,426
<i>Wait for me, Mom...
I'm coming.</i>

1396
01:37:01,065 --> 01:37:02,066
<i>I'm sorry,</i>

1397
01:37:02,474 --> 01:37:05,728
<i>I thought I'd made things clear
to Sarada, but...</i>

1398
01:37:06,487 --> 01:37:09,198
<i>No, it's my fault.</i>

1399
01:37:09,698 --> 01:37:11,617
<i>You don't need to apologize.</i>

1400
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:15,120
<i>My wife's not weak.</i>

1401
01:37:18,140 --> 01:37:22,102
<i>How does he really feel about Mom?</i>

1402
01:37:23,303 --> 01:37:26,974
<i>I wonder what really went on
between the two of them.</i>

1403
01:37:32,179 --> 01:37:33,180
Lord Seventh...

1404
01:37:36,892 --> 01:37:38,811
<i>I'm going to save
all this thinking for later.</i>

1405
01:37:39,061 --> 01:37:41,188
<i>Right now, I just want to save Mom!</i>

1406
01:37:41,430 --> 01:37:42,639
<i>That's all that matters!</i>

1407
01:37:43,941 --> 01:37:44,942
We should be close.

1408
01:37:45,234 --> 01:37:47,111
Naruto, sense them out.

1409
01:37:47,403 --> 01:37:48,404
Right!

1410
01:38:00,165 --> 01:38:02,751
I am the only one who deserves
to carry out Itachi's wishes,

1411
01:38:02,793 --> 01:38:04,712
and carry on the Uchiha name!

1412
01:38:05,337 --> 01:38:07,089
My goal is...

1413
01:38:07,882 --> 01:38:10,050
to revive the Akatsuki,

1414
01:38:10,283 --> 01:38:13,578
and stir up conflict throughout
the world once more.

1415
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,351
"Your" goal... huh.

1416
01:38:21,145 --> 01:38:23,355
I guess I don't have to worry.

1417
01:38:23,981 --> 01:38:25,733
Since it's apparent
you have no friends.

1418
01:38:26,150 --> 01:38:27,234
Friends?

1419
01:38:27,484 --> 01:38:29,320
As long as I take you down...

1420
01:38:29,945 --> 01:38:32,281
everything will be settled!

1421
01:38:37,786 --> 01:38:40,664
I won't let you
continue to go after

1422
01:38:41,332 --> 01:38:42,791
my husband and my daughter!

1423
01:38:46,253 --> 01:38:48,380
So this is Shin Uchiha's hideout!

1424
01:38:49,506 --> 01:38:50,507
They're coming!

1425
01:38:54,178 --> 01:38:56,180
What?! Three of them
with the same face?!

1426
01:38:56,388 --> 01:38:58,140
These are clones!

1427
01:38:59,934 --> 01:39:01,352
Father's orders...

1428
01:39:01,518 --> 01:39:03,103
Get rid of the intruders.

1429
01:39:08,525 --> 01:39:10,402
Hey, Sarada?!

1430
01:39:15,741 --> 01:39:17,284
I'm sorry, Lord Seventh!

1431
01:39:17,501 --> 01:39:19,377
I'm going to go rescue Mom!

1432
01:39:19,402 --> 01:39:20,403
Damn it.

1433
01:39:20,428 --> 01:39:22,054
Sasuke!
Go with her!

1434
01:39:22,206 --> 01:39:23,791
Just let me handle these guys!

1435
01:39:23,874 --> 01:39:26,085
Huh?
Then what about me?!

1436
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:28,420
Didn't I tell you?
I'll protect you.

1437
01:39:29,212 --> 01:39:30,672
First, let's immobilize them...

1438
01:39:33,650 --> 01:39:34,651
Creepy!

1439
01:39:34,843 --> 01:39:37,137
Just how many of them are there?

1440
01:39:37,837 --> 01:39:39,756
Father's orders.

1441
01:39:40,224 --> 01:39:42,309
Get rid... of the... intruders.

1442
01:39:42,935 --> 01:39:44,311
<i>Get rid... of the... intruders.</i>

1443
01:39:44,478 --> 01:39:45,854
– <i>Get rid... of the... intruders.</i>
– Damn that Shin...

1444
01:39:45,938 --> 01:39:48,148
– <i>Get rid... of the... intruders.</i>
– What are you doing, Lord Seventh?!

1445
01:39:48,232 --> 01:39:51,110
Aren't they the enemy?
We should just take them down!

1446
01:39:52,036 --> 01:39:53,454
No, I can't do that.

1447
01:39:54,028 --> 01:39:58,408
Be they clones or whatever,
they called Shin, "Father."

1448
01:39:59,743 --> 01:40:04,999
A parent should never do
something like this to their child.

1449
01:40:46,290 --> 01:40:48,959
Cha!

1450
01:41:12,441 --> 01:41:13,442
<i>Mom!</i>

1451
01:41:13,599 --> 01:41:15,810
<i>I swear I'll save you!</i>

1452
01:41:20,365 --> 01:41:21,366
A trap?!

1453
01:41:27,164 --> 01:41:28,165
Dad!

1454
01:41:33,754 --> 01:41:34,755
What's the matter?

1455
01:41:35,047 --> 01:41:36,048
Let's go.

1456
01:42:00,413 --> 01:42:04,000
No one escapes my Sharingan...

1457
01:42:14,861 --> 01:42:15,862
Mom!

1458
01:42:18,139 --> 01:42:19,682
Mom! You're hurt!

1459
01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:26,306
<i>Amaterasu!</i>

1460
01:42:30,376 --> 01:42:32,295
You can heal your wounds
yourself, right?

1461
01:42:32,646 --> 01:42:33,647
Yes...

1462
01:42:33,981 --> 01:42:36,024
Thanks, dear.

1463
01:42:48,078 --> 01:42:50,146
With that leg, you shouldn't
be able to move anymore.

1464
01:42:52,249 --> 01:42:54,418
We'll be examining you thoroughly
back at the Leaf.

1465
01:43:01,758 --> 01:43:02,759
That boy!

1466
01:43:05,179 --> 01:43:06,180
Move.

1467
01:43:06,346 --> 01:43:07,681
I have no qualms with you.

1468
01:43:08,090 --> 01:43:09,091
I will not move.

1469
01:43:09,182 --> 01:43:10,934
I will protect Father.

1470
01:43:12,435 --> 01:43:14,729
I'm not as soft as Naruto.

1471
01:43:31,429 --> 01:43:33,347
Stop it, Dad!

1472
01:43:52,917 --> 01:43:54,001
Sasuke!

1473
01:44:10,143 --> 01:44:13,104
The tables have turned...

1474
01:44:18,335 --> 01:44:20,671
As expected, you are all weak!

1475
01:44:21,004 --> 01:44:25,217
It's because worthless parental
feelings have oppressed you...

1476
01:44:25,242 --> 01:44:27,536
that's why everything's
turned out this way.

1477
01:44:28,303 --> 01:44:29,187
Dear!

1478
01:44:30,605 --> 01:44:31,648
Do not move.

1479
01:44:32,299 --> 01:44:34,926
You cannot escape my Sharingan.

1480
01:44:37,805 --> 01:44:40,363
You are a disgrace to the Uchiha.

1481
01:44:41,233 --> 01:44:46,029
I will carry out Itachi's will
and revive the Akatsuki.

1482
01:44:46,989 --> 01:44:48,448
It's okay, Sarada.

1483
01:44:50,242 --> 01:44:54,079
Something like this
isn't enough to defeat your dad.

1484
01:44:57,098 --> 01:44:58,099
Trust us.

1485
01:44:59,184 --> 01:45:02,395
Your dad and I will protect you,
no matter what!

1486
01:45:07,426 --> 01:45:09,219
<i>It's useless switching places.</i>

1487
01:45:09,386 --> 01:45:11,805
<i>I'll impale the three of you,
together as a family!</i>

1488
01:45:29,197 --> 01:45:31,867
You said a parent's love
is worthless...

1489
01:45:32,583 --> 01:45:34,418
but I don't agree.

1490
01:45:35,553 --> 01:45:37,138
Never underestimate a parent.

1491
01:45:39,249 --> 01:45:40,334
Mom!

1492
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:47,341
They're calling...

1493
01:45:52,471 --> 01:45:53,638
What's going on?

1494
01:45:55,265 --> 01:45:56,475
I don't know...

1495
01:45:57,100 --> 01:45:59,227
But I think Sasuke and the others
got things under control.

1496
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:01,104
Let's go!

1497
01:46:08,028 --> 01:46:09,029
Sarada!

1498
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:12,366
It's over, Shin.

1499
01:46:13,158 --> 01:46:15,369
<i>I'll have to use the Shins
as a distraction</i>

1500
01:46:15,410 --> 01:46:17,204
<i>and retreat for now.</i>

1501
01:46:19,790 --> 01:46:20,916
Not yet.

1502
01:46:22,466 --> 01:46:23,876
All of you...

1503
01:46:26,529 --> 01:46:27,697
Do it!

1504
01:46:31,635 --> 01:46:32,419
What...?

1505
01:46:35,847 --> 01:46:38,517
What... are you... doing...?

1506
01:46:38,542 --> 01:46:39,918
Enough...

1507
01:46:40,727 --> 01:46:43,105
We are to dispose of
old, useless flesh.

1508
01:46:43,772 --> 01:46:46,191
That's what you taught us, Father.

1509
01:46:46,515 --> 01:46:48,100
You!

1510
01:46:48,735 --> 01:46:52,114
I... am... the original!

1511
01:46:52,364 --> 01:46:53,824
Your visual prowess

1512
01:46:54,616 --> 01:46:56,493
is weak now... Father.

1513
01:46:57,035 --> 01:47:01,039
From now on... we will evolve.

1514
01:47:01,981 --> 01:47:04,859
That is the most
logical thing to do...

1515
01:47:05,544 --> 01:47:06,545
Is this...

1516
01:47:07,337 --> 01:47:10,674
the evolution that you hoped for?

1517
01:47:25,730 --> 01:47:28,692
Hey, hey!
There's still this many of you?

1518
01:47:30,235 --> 01:47:32,320
When did you...

1519
01:47:33,405 --> 01:47:34,573
so many...?

1520
01:47:35,073 --> 01:47:37,242
We made more of ourselves.

1521
01:47:37,868 --> 01:47:41,246
We don't need you anymore, Father.

1522
01:47:41,455 --> 01:47:44,499
There are some
pretty chubby ones too!

1523
01:47:44,666 --> 01:47:46,793
I guess they couldn't
clone them too well...

1524
01:47:49,388 --> 01:47:51,306
<i>Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

1525
01:48:03,935 --> 01:48:04,978
<i>Susano'o!</i>

1526
01:48:08,940 --> 01:48:10,442
Don't kill 'em, Sasuke!

1527
01:48:10,942 --> 01:48:12,569
You're as soft as ever!

1528
01:48:13,487 --> 01:48:15,864
Dad... Lord Seventh!

1529
01:48:20,744 --> 01:48:23,205
<i>I can't die yet!</i>

1530
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:26,666
<i>You're coming with us,
medical ninja!</i>

1531
01:48:32,964 --> 01:48:33,774
Sarada!

1532
01:48:34,132 --> 01:48:35,467
I know!

1533
01:48:42,974 --> 01:48:45,352
– Mom, I'm going to...
– Don't get in our way!

1534
01:48:47,294 --> 01:48:48,295
...protect you!

1535
01:48:51,408 --> 01:48:54,035
Cha!

1536
01:49:05,121 --> 01:49:06,122
Sarada...

1537
01:49:06,573 --> 01:49:07,907
Amazing!

1538
01:49:13,338 --> 01:49:14,839
Still going to keep this up?

1539
01:49:20,762 --> 01:49:22,055
Calm down.

1540
01:49:24,474 --> 01:49:25,475
Kurama...

1541
01:49:30,272 --> 01:49:31,731
There's no need to be scared.

1542
01:49:32,774 --> 01:49:36,403
If you don't do anymore bad stuff,
we won't do anything either.

1543
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:43,743
You're way too soft...

1544
01:49:44,035 --> 01:49:46,121
They're still kids.

1545
01:49:46,413 --> 01:49:49,541
We have to teach them
what's right and wrong.

1546
01:49:54,462 --> 01:49:56,715
Carrying on Itachi's will, huh?

1547
01:49:58,083 --> 01:50:00,794
You really didn't understand
anything about him.

1548
01:50:01,961 --> 01:50:03,504
Sarada, way to go!

1549
01:50:03,630 --> 01:50:06,216
The Uchiha Clan is amazing!

1550
01:50:06,407 --> 01:50:08,159
That was some awesome power!

1551
01:50:08,935 --> 01:50:10,604
Huh? Sarada...

1552
01:50:11,396 --> 01:50:13,690
Your eyes are just like your dad's!

1553
01:50:19,946 --> 01:50:21,190
Sarada...

1554
01:50:23,783 --> 01:50:27,037
You had me so worried!

1555
01:50:28,479 --> 01:50:29,480
I'm sorry.

1556
01:50:31,599 --> 01:50:33,101
I'm so glad you're okay...

1557
01:50:34,669 --> 01:50:36,963
You're squishing me, Mom!

1558
01:50:37,589 --> 01:50:39,507
Oh, sorry.

1559
01:50:43,803 --> 01:50:44,804
Dad!

1560
01:50:47,399 --> 01:50:51,570
Are your feelings really
connected with Mom's?

1561
01:50:53,304 --> 01:50:54,305
Yeah...

1562
01:50:55,273 --> 01:50:56,900
How can you say that for sure?

1563
01:50:59,861 --> 01:51:01,446
Because you exist...

1564
01:51:02,613 --> 01:51:03,656
Sarada.

1565
01:51:11,873 --> 01:51:14,376
You're so lucky, Sarada.

1566
01:51:15,818 --> 01:51:17,862
All right! Let's go home!

1567
01:51:23,468 --> 01:51:24,511
First of all,

1568
01:51:24,594 --> 01:51:27,806
we'll need to give each one of you
a name for convenience...

1569
01:51:30,892 --> 01:51:33,520
There are too many of you,
so before that...

1570
01:51:34,396 --> 01:51:37,565
You're going to be living
in this facility from today.

1571
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:41,444
In other words,
we're all going to be a family.

1572
01:51:43,270 --> 01:51:45,064
My name is Kabuto.

1573
01:51:46,440 --> 01:51:47,692
There's no need to be shy, okay?

1574
01:51:50,386 --> 01:51:51,763
Aw man!

1575
01:51:51,871 --> 01:51:54,457
This was supposed to be
my journey to find my real dad,

1576
01:51:54,482 --> 01:51:56,776
but you found your dad instead.

1577
01:51:57,444 --> 01:52:00,781
Are you going to keep searching...
for your real dad?

1578
01:52:01,306 --> 01:52:02,432
Well...

1579
01:52:02,707 --> 01:52:05,502
The one I have now isn't bad...

1580
01:52:05,535 --> 01:52:08,204
I guess I'll make do
with him for now.

1581
01:52:08,513 --> 01:52:10,265
"Make do"?

1582
01:52:10,473 --> 01:52:14,519
Ahh... I wonder where
my real dad is?

1583
01:52:18,064 --> 01:52:19,941
Who's that cool guy?

1584
01:52:21,059 --> 01:52:23,561
Um... Would you happen to be...

1585
01:52:24,571 --> 01:52:26,114
Oh, Cho-Cho!

1586
01:52:26,239 --> 01:52:27,824
Did you come to get me?

1587
01:52:29,242 --> 01:52:30,326
Thank you!

1588
01:52:31,878 --> 01:52:33,129
This touch...

1589
01:52:34,748 --> 01:52:35,749
I knew it!

1590
01:52:36,849 --> 01:52:38,225
Wh-What's the matter?

1591
01:52:38,334 --> 01:52:39,669
Oh, I understand...

1592
01:52:40,044 --> 01:52:41,546
I think this is the first time

1593
01:52:41,696 --> 01:52:44,156
Cho-Cho is seeing you
with that physique, Choji...

1594
01:52:44,716 --> 01:52:45,608
Huh?

1595
01:52:50,888 --> 01:52:54,433
Huh?! Is that really you... Dad?!

1596
01:52:54,484 --> 01:52:55,652
Yes, I am...

1597
01:52:55,818 --> 01:52:56,944
What's with this?!

1598
01:52:56,969 --> 01:52:59,680
Is it some secret
Akimichi Clan jutsu?

1599
01:52:59,797 --> 01:53:02,216
Well... sort of.

1600
01:53:02,458 --> 01:53:04,460
I want to learn it too!

1601
01:53:04,611 --> 01:53:06,529
Can you teach me tomorrow, Dad?!

1602
01:53:08,106 --> 01:53:09,190
Oh, Choji!

1603
01:53:09,515 --> 01:53:11,934
Cho-Cho was searching
for you all this time.

1604
01:53:12,168 --> 01:53:14,503
I was on a mission...

1605
01:53:15,262 --> 01:53:16,347
Sasuke?!

1606
01:53:16,664 --> 01:53:18,875
It's been a while!

1607
01:53:19,250 --> 01:53:20,084
Huh?

1608
01:53:20,326 --> 01:53:21,869
What?

1609
01:53:28,192 --> 01:53:29,235
Huh?!

1610
01:53:29,260 --> 01:53:30,804
That's ridiculous!

1611
01:53:30,911 --> 01:53:34,665
Sarada is really and truly Sasuke's
and Sakura's daughter!

1612
01:53:35,073 --> 01:53:37,159
But what about that umbilical cord?

1613
01:53:37,184 --> 01:53:39,145
It's Sarada and Sakura's!

1614
01:53:39,270 --> 01:53:43,066
I was the one who delivered Sarada
when Sakura went into labor!

1615
01:53:44,125 --> 01:53:45,292
Really?

1616
01:53:45,793 --> 01:53:49,380
You used to be so crazy
for Sasuke before...

1617
01:53:49,663 --> 01:53:50,706
Idiot!

1618
01:53:50,990 --> 01:53:54,369
All I want is for Sasuke
to be happy.

1619
01:53:54,744 --> 01:53:58,164
Besides... women can
just be friends too, you know.

1620
01:53:58,540 --> 01:53:59,791
Is that so?

1621
01:54:00,917 --> 01:54:03,795
Does that mean you've totally
given up on Sasuke?

1622
01:54:08,415 --> 01:54:10,167
You really don't get it, do you?

1623
01:54:10,334 --> 01:54:13,379
Bonds come in all kinds of shapes.

1624
01:54:14,514 --> 01:54:16,140
But never mind that.

1625
01:54:16,349 --> 01:54:18,142
Suigetsu, go and apologize
to Sarada!

1626
01:54:18,318 --> 01:54:21,237
And bring her some new glasses,
while you're at it!!

1627
01:54:21,604 --> 01:54:23,940
I bet she's outgrowing
her current pair.

1628
01:54:24,023 --> 01:54:25,066
Right now?!

1629
01:54:26,359 --> 01:54:27,527
Seriously...

1630
01:54:27,986 --> 01:54:29,320
Cha you guys...

1631
01:54:29,612 --> 01:54:33,116
Of course, you are really
and truly my daughter.

1632
01:54:33,408 --> 01:54:34,492
You're so silly.

1633
01:54:39,414 --> 01:54:42,041
I'm sorry too, Dad.

1634
01:54:42,558 --> 01:54:43,559
Don't worry about it.

1635
01:54:43,826 --> 01:54:46,370
You probably took after me
in that respect.

1636
01:54:54,462 --> 01:54:56,589
When will you be home next?

1637
01:55:11,696 --> 01:55:12,697
Dad...

1638
01:55:13,873 --> 01:55:15,381
Don't make such a sad face.

1639
01:55:23,791 --> 01:55:25,043
Till next time.

1640
01:55:25,810 --> 01:55:29,271
<i>Then tell me!
What was better than a kiss?!</i>

1641
01:55:30,757 --> 01:55:33,217
<i>I'll tell you... next time.</i>

1642
01:55:35,386 --> 01:55:37,263
<i>I think you'll understand
when you see your dad.</i>

1643
01:55:52,654 --> 01:55:54,489
Here's your lunch.

1644
01:55:54,781 --> 01:55:55,782
Thanks.

1645
01:56:05,041 --> 01:56:06,042
See you...

1646
01:56:06,542 --> 01:56:07,543
I'm going to get going.

1647
01:56:09,212 --> 01:56:10,880
<i>Just a raincheck for me?</i>

1648
01:56:11,214 --> 01:56:12,840
<i>Cha...</i>

1649
01:56:18,346 --> 01:56:20,765
I've decided...

1650
01:56:24,894 --> 01:56:25,853
Thanks.

1651
01:56:26,229 --> 01:56:27,230
For what?

1652
01:56:28,690 --> 01:56:31,401
Delivering that lunch box
to my dad.

1653
01:56:33,862 --> 01:56:36,948
Same here. Because of that,
I've decided what my goal is.

1654
01:56:38,891 --> 01:56:40,643
So... I should be thanking you.

1655
01:56:41,536 --> 01:56:42,537
Your goal?

1656
01:56:43,221 --> 01:56:46,933
I can't very well deliver lunch
to everyone in the village...

1657
01:56:47,958 --> 01:56:48,959
So...

1658
01:56:49,444 --> 01:56:52,363
I've decided...
I'm going to become the Hokage.

1659
01:58:28,184 --> 01:58:31,437
<i>It's been fifteen years
since the Fourth Great Ninja War...</i>

1660
01:58:31,604 --> 01:58:35,483
<i>Many children have been
born since that battle.</i>

1661
01:58:36,475 --> 01:58:38,394
<i>Not only in the Land of Fire...</i>

1662
01:58:38,569 --> 01:58:43,616
<i>but all Five Nations made it
through without great upheaval,</i>

1663
01:58:43,658 --> 01:58:45,827
<i>thanks to everyone's perseverance
and hard work.</i>

1664
01:58:46,903 --> 01:58:51,991
<i>We, the Five Kage, will remain united
and protect the peace we won.</i>

1665
01:58:57,505 --> 01:58:59,423
We'll now have a closed session.

1666
01:59:04,586 --> 01:59:05,671
All right...

1667
01:59:05,763 --> 01:59:07,265
Shall we get into the real agenda?

1668
01:59:11,394 --> 01:59:13,688
I don't see Sasuke.

1669
01:59:14,730 --> 01:59:18,693
Wasn't there something urgent to
discuss regarding his mission?

1670
01:59:19,402 --> 01:59:21,195
Sasuke's already departed.

1671
01:59:22,262 --> 01:59:24,681
It's a situation
which calls for quick action.

1672
01:59:25,741 --> 01:59:26,951
What do you mean?

1673
01:59:29,871 --> 01:59:31,664
Our shinobi world...

1674
01:59:32,523 --> 01:59:36,276
is about to confront
another danger.

1675
01:59:37,662 --> 01:59:39,872
You're going to fill us in
on the details, aren't you?

1676
01:59:40,464 --> 01:59:44,260
Kaguya, the one Sasuke
and I sealed back then

1677
01:59:44,343 --> 01:59:47,013
had a scary, powerful army behind her.

1678
01:59:47,805 --> 01:59:50,349
You mean the White Zetsu
that Madara mobilized?

1679
01:59:50,883 --> 01:59:52,760
They gave us a ton of trouble.

1680
01:59:53,311 --> 01:59:56,230
Kaguya herself was
powerful enough.

1681
01:59:56,656 --> 02:00:00,576
But the fact that she had a White
Zetsu army behind her worried us.

1682
02:00:01,319 --> 02:00:03,821
Wasn't it because having to face
the Allied Shinobi Forces

1683
02:00:03,846 --> 02:00:05,556
would put her at a disadvantage?

1684
02:00:06,157 --> 02:00:08,075
Apparently, that wasn't it.

1685
02:00:08,868 --> 02:00:11,621
We discovered that the White Zetsu
were created way before

1686
02:00:11,704 --> 02:00:16,292
we shinobi were born
into this world.

1687
02:00:17,426 --> 02:00:19,261
That's impossible!

1688
02:00:19,954 --> 02:00:22,957
If that's true, for what purpose?

1689
02:00:23,907 --> 02:00:26,743
Intel we've gathered so far...

1690
02:00:27,178 --> 02:00:29,513
hints that in time,

1691
02:00:29,538 --> 02:00:35,002
an existence even more frightening
than Kaguya will appear in this world.

1692
02:00:35,503 --> 02:00:36,504
What?!

1693
02:00:49,367 --> 02:00:50,451
The Hokage, huh?

1694
02:00:51,702 --> 02:00:54,705
Someday, the Great Stone Faces
will include mine...

1695
02:00:56,040 --> 02:00:57,041
Boruto?!

1696
02:00:58,793 --> 02:01:01,003
A foe more powerful than Kaguya...

1697
02:01:01,563 --> 02:01:04,858
And the White Zetsu army
is for that purpose?

1698
02:01:06,008 --> 02:01:07,718
Is there any other reason?

1699
02:01:08,377 --> 02:01:13,006
And you investigated something
so important like this behind our backs?

1700
02:01:13,907 --> 02:01:16,159
You're pretty crafty...

1701
02:01:16,310 --> 02:01:20,273
It was my plan to keep this quiet
until we obtained concrete proof.

1702
02:01:20,814 --> 02:01:22,441
But something like this...

1703
02:01:22,900 --> 02:01:24,944
We may be at peace now,

1704
02:01:24,969 --> 02:01:28,723
but the ravages of war haven't
been completely erased.

1705
02:01:29,323 --> 02:01:31,701
How do we explain this
to our people?

1706
02:01:32,827 --> 02:01:35,221
Just thinking about it
makes me feel dull.

1707
02:01:35,788 --> 02:01:37,957
I can't believe that
this could be false intel,

1708
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:41,043
a prank intended to fuel unrest.

1709
02:01:43,045 --> 02:01:45,380
The future ought to stay bright.

1710
02:01:46,590 --> 02:01:47,800
That's what Sasuke said.

1711
02:01:53,639 --> 02:01:57,852
How much time do we have until
this new enemy appears?

1712
02:01:58,644 --> 02:02:01,714
A few months or years,
maybe more.

1713
02:02:02,940 --> 02:02:04,442
We haven't been able
to pin that down.

1714
02:02:06,618 --> 02:02:08,311
That's not good.

1715
02:02:08,904 --> 02:02:09,697
Yes...

1716
02:02:10,156 --> 02:02:12,325
It's bad enough if it's during
our generation.

1717
02:02:12,558 --> 02:02:14,834
If it occurs in
the next generation...

1718
02:02:15,202 --> 02:02:16,704
What do you mean?

1719
02:02:20,541 --> 02:02:22,710
It's hard to say it out loud,
but I'll say it.

1720
02:02:23,336 --> 02:02:27,381
The generation below us is...
frankly, not up to par.

1721
02:02:33,137 --> 02:02:36,932
The tension-filled past between
the Five Great Nations has changed.

1722
02:02:37,391 --> 02:02:39,518
The lack of real skills
among the young

1723
02:02:39,543 --> 02:02:42,546
is a deep concern for
every village.

1724
02:02:43,356 --> 02:02:45,941
Shin Uchiha's belief that
for evolution,

1725
02:02:46,609 --> 02:02:49,077
conflict is essential in
the further selection of superior genes...

1726
02:02:49,102 --> 02:02:51,729
I don't want to admit it
but he may have a point...

1727
02:02:52,656 --> 02:02:56,535
Our generation united as
the Allied Shinobi Force.

1728
02:02:56,743 --> 02:02:58,828
That's why we were able to
emerge victorious in that great war.

1729
02:02:59,455 --> 02:03:03,709
But there's no guarantee that
the next generation can win.

1730
02:03:04,293 --> 02:03:07,505
And that's why we have
to be the ones

1731
02:03:07,546 --> 02:03:11,509
who will destroy this existence
that surpasses Kaguya,

1732
02:03:11,683 --> 02:03:13,518
or there will be trouble, right?

1733
02:03:20,601 --> 02:03:22,311
Don't you have anything
better to do?

1734
02:03:22,978 --> 02:03:24,813
Sarada, damn it.

1735
02:03:27,808 --> 02:03:31,019
Gaara, why don't you
say something?

1736
02:03:33,114 --> 02:03:35,574
Unreliable compared to
the last generation...

1737
02:03:35,658 --> 02:03:38,744
Is there any generation that
hasn't been compared like that?

1738
02:03:41,330 --> 02:03:43,072
Isn't that right, Naruto?

1739
02:03:45,376 --> 02:03:46,168
Yeah...

1740
02:03:52,508 --> 02:03:55,010
I won't let you deface the Hokage!

1741
02:03:55,302 --> 02:03:56,429
Why not?!

1742
02:03:56,679 --> 02:04:00,474
Hokage are old-fashioned,
disgraceful and useless!

1743
02:04:00,683 --> 02:04:02,435
Lord Seventh told me...

1744
02:04:02,476 --> 02:04:06,397
that everyone in the entire village
is like his family!

1745
02:04:06,939 --> 02:04:08,965
What an exaggeration!
He's all talk!

1746
02:04:15,948 --> 02:04:18,742
War isn't the only kind
of conflict there is.

1747
02:04:19,368 --> 02:04:24,623
We can battle and compete
with friends and hone our skills.

1748
02:04:25,541 --> 02:04:29,336
If you think hard on it,
you can relate, can't you?

1749
02:04:38,203 --> 02:04:41,439
It's true, the era in which we
fought is much different from today.

1750
02:04:42,016 --> 02:04:43,058
But you know...

1751
02:04:43,142 --> 02:04:46,228
I don't believe
that those kids are weak.

1752
02:04:47,062 --> 02:04:49,565
They're still buds.

1753
02:04:50,107 --> 02:04:53,611
But someday,
they'll surpass us as shinobi...

1754
02:04:54,195 --> 02:04:58,949
And they'll fill this village with
fresh, green leaves, ya know.

1755
02:04:59,033 --> 02:05:00,743
I have faith in that.

1756
02:05:18,510 --> 02:05:20,846
Honestly... I'm shocked.

1757
02:05:23,307 --> 02:05:24,767
You want to continue?

1758
02:05:29,647 --> 02:05:31,649
Any more than this will kill me.

1759
02:05:32,608 --> 02:05:34,109
Let's continue this another time!

1760
02:05:39,856 --> 02:05:41,091
Then it's a draw.

1761
02:05:46,605 --> 02:05:48,816
Looks like I've won, Sarada!

1762
02:05:55,147 --> 02:05:55,981
Lord Seventh!

1763
02:05:56,063 --> 02:05:57,273
Bad news!

1764
02:05:57,724 --> 02:05:59,034
The Great Stone Faces are...

1765
02:06:14,942 --> 02:06:17,778
Th-That kid...

1766
02:06:18,445 --> 02:06:20,155
One thing's certain...

1767
02:06:20,531 --> 02:06:23,409
He might just become a shinobi
that surpasses us.

1768
02:06:23,617 --> 02:06:25,077
You coward!

1769
02:06:25,494 --> 02:06:28,539
I'm okay with being a coward,
totally fine with it!

1770
02:06:33,210 --> 02:06:35,921
Hey, isn't that a cowardly move?

1771
02:06:36,463 --> 02:06:39,216
But you're okay with that... right?

1772
02:06:39,866 --> 02:06:41,951
This calls for Sexy Jutsu!

1773
02:06:43,479 --> 02:06:45,139
What is that jutsu?!

1774
02:06:45,180 --> 02:06:47,600
I'll pulverize whoever
came up with that!

1775
02:06:47,641 --> 02:06:48,767
H-Hey, wait!

1776
02:06:48,809 --> 02:06:51,478
I still think they make a good couple.

1777
02:06:51,562 --> 02:06:52,813
Give me a break! I'm going to die.

1778
02:06:52,855 --> 02:06:54,106
Stop it!

1779
02:06:54,189 --> 02:06:55,107
Boruto!
