1
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:50,494
There's something kind
of creepy about this place.

2
00:01:52,532 --> 00:01:57,037
This place is called the Forest of Death.
You'll soon find out why.

3
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:00,286
That threat won't work on me!

4
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,539
I'm not scared!

5
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,916
You've got a lot of energy.

6
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:12,882
A kid like you will be the first to die,

7
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,178
spilling all that blood I love.

8
00:02:20,415 --> 00:02:22,917
I'm here to return your kunai.

9
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,436
Thanks for the trouble...

10
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:33,361
However... you shouldn't stand behind me
while reeking of such bloodlust.

11
00:02:34,857 --> 00:02:37,026
If you don't want a quick death...

12
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:43,872
I tend to get excited
at the sight of blood.

13
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:49,752
And my precious hair was cut,
so I got a little excited...

14
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,380
Naruto...

15
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,299
I'm sorry...

16
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,179
<i>Wh-What's with that proctor?</i>

17
00:02:59,668 --> 00:03:00,961
<i>Seriously, she's a psycho!</i>

18
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,266
<i>This one, too...</i>

19
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,437
<i>And what's with that woman's long tongue?</i>

20
00:03:09,336 --> 00:03:13,507
Looks like we've got a lot of
hot-blooded kids this time.

21
00:03:16,137 --> 00:03:21,768
Well, before we start the second test,
I have something to hand out.

22
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,038
It's a consent form,

23
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,082
From this point on,
people will die.

24
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,710
And for that, I need your consent!

25
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,713
Otherwise, I'd be held responsible.

26
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,551
All right! I'm going to start explaining
the second test to you.

27
00:03:38,803 --> 00:03:42,974
To put it simply, this is an extreme
survival test.

28
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:47,163
A no-holds-barred battle for scrolls!

29
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,312
The Heaven Scroll and the Earth Scroll.

30
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,606
Your job will be fighting for them.

31
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:55,860
There are 78 of you, in 26 teams.

32
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,322
Half the teams, or 13,
will be given Heaven Scrolls.

33
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,909
The other half will be
given Earth Scrolls.

34
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,370
Each team will have
one of the scrolls.

35
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:09,165
The objective is...

36
00:04:10,136 --> 00:04:12,518
to acquire both scrolls

37
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:15,505
and bring them to the central tower
as a team.

38
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,468
For this second test,
the time limit is 120 hours.

39
00:04:20,831 --> 00:04:23,167
You have exactly five days!

40
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:24,364
Five days?!

41
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,974
What do we do about food?

42
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:29,352
You'll have to fend for yourselves!
The forest has everything you need to survive.

43
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,354
There's more than enough food...

44
00:04:31,914 --> 00:04:32,915
However...

45
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,608
It's teeming with fierce
man-eating animals,

46
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:38,788
poisonous bugs, poisonous plants...
the list goes on.

47
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,406
On top of that, you're surrounded
by nothing but enemies,

48
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:44,117
you'll even have trouble
getting any sleep...

49
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:48,579
And aside from injuries sustained
while fighting for the scrolls...

50
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:50,748
there will be contestants

51
00:04:50,773 --> 00:04:53,692
who can't endure the harsh environment.

52
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,130
Next, the conditions for disqualification.

53
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:01,592
Rule 1: If all three members
of the team can't make it to the tower

54
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:04,762
with the Heaven and Earth Scrolls
within the time limit.

55
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:11,936
Rule 2: If a team loses a member,
or a member becomes incapacitated.

56
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,188
And one more thing...

57
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,025
Absolutely do not look at
the contents of the scrolls

58
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,110
until you have reached the tower!

59
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:23,072
Wh-What happens if we peek inside
before we get there?

60
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:28,453
You're welcome to take a peek
and find... out.

61
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:29,829
Huh?

62
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:35,400
A Chunin is often entrusted
with top-secret documents.

63
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,628
This is a test of your integrity.

64
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,071
That concludes the explanation!

65
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,675
Exchange your team's three consent forms
for one scroll at that hut over there.

66
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:47,513
After that, pick your entrance,
and all gates will open simultaneously

67
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:06,324
<i>I see, so you won't know which
scroll was given to each team...</i>

68
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:11,329
<i>and you won't know which of the three
members is carrying the scroll.</i>

69
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,082
<i>If what Ibiki said was right,</i>

70
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:18,461
<i>this test is a life-or-death
battle of information.</i>

71
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,381
<i>Which means it's possible
we'll have to kill.</i>

72
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:27,553
<i>Looks like they're starting to understand
the meaning of these consent forms...</i>

73
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:36,604
Yeah! Survival is our forte!

74
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,148
Hinata, don't let them see
you're scared.

75
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,150
Uh, okay...

76
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,486
Life or death...

77
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,280
What a drag...
but I guess we have no choice.

78
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,908
Now that we're here,
let's make Naruto our target.

79
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:52,203
For snacks, I brought some potato chips...

80
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,913
- And a shortcake.
- You two are unbelievable!

81
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,959
All right! I'm not going to lose!

82
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,796
I'll take down
anyone who gets in my way.

83
00:07:02,878 --> 00:07:05,506
Heh heh... The time has finally come.

84
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:09,387
We have the chance to truly begin
our mission.

85
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,603
<i>Sure, the enemy teams are scary but,</i>

86
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:21,190
<i>I'm more scared of spending
five days with him.</i>

87
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,112
Target the rookies first.

88
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,031
Now that they've said
killing is allowed,

89
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,533
that makes things easier.

90
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:38,916
Guy-sensei, I'll do my best!
I'll absolutely succeed!

91
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:47,842
We now start the second
test of the Chunin Exam!

92
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,473
Look for the brats!

93
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,224
Those three, right?

94
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,770
All right! Let's go!

95
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,450
Okay! First, let's start tracking.

96
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,160
Can you do it, Hinata?

97
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:15,161
Yes.

98
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:19,540
<i>Byakugan!</i>

99
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:26,047
Slow down, Lee!
We just started.

100
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,674
I know. But...

101
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,552
I can't stay still!

102
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,472
Who knows what kind of
powerful foes are waiting for us.

103
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,767
Hot-blooded fool...

104
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,604
As you already understand,
we have only one target!

105
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:52,114
Anyway, the tower is the
goal for everyone, right?

106
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:55,868
Then it would be smart to set up
traps near the tower.

107
00:08:56,407 --> 00:08:58,117
Heh... kids.

108
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:01,832
Standing out in the open like that,
they're just asking to be found.

109
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,002
What happened?
You're pale.

110
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,172
Wh-What is that?!

111
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:19,058
The Leaf's flying leeches sense
body heat and perspiration,

112
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,018
then, in a mass, swoop down
on their prey.

113
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:24,063
If they continue to suck
your blood for five minutes,

114
00:09:24,088 --> 00:09:25,298
you'll be dead.

115
00:09:27,294 --> 00:09:29,088
It sounds like they've already started.

116
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,949
Wasn't that someone screaming
just now?

117
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:39,597
I-It's nothing to worry about, Sakura.

118
00:09:41,056 --> 00:09:43,309
I-I have to pee...

119
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,668
Y-You... idiot!

120
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,629
What are you doing
in front of a lady!

121
00:09:48,771 --> 00:09:50,106
Go do it in the bushes!

122
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:55,469
Aaah, that was a lot!
I feel so much better.

123
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:58,514
I told you, not in front of a lady!

124
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:07,064
S-Sasuke... That's too much.
You don't have to go this far.

125
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,858
Wh-What was that for...?

126
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,786
What are you doing all of a sudden?!

127
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,122
Speak! Where's the real Naruto!

128
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:27,126
I have no idea what
you're talking about!

129
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,794
What happened to the scratch
on your face?

130
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,758
Your shuriken holster
is on your left leg

131
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,718
and you're not right-handed!

132
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:42,975
Unlucky for me! So you figured it out.
In that case...

133
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,935
Which one of you has the scroll?!

134
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,812
Looks like I'll have to use force, then!

135
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,358
<i>Fire Style: Phoenix Flower Jutsu!</i>

136
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,032
Heeeey! Sasuke!

137
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,117
<i>You've got to be kidding me, you loser.</i>

138
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:01,577
All right!

139
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,996
I caught you off guard! Lucky!

140
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,415
Paper bomb!

141
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,712
This is lucky!

142
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:15,299
Move and you're dead!
Now hand over the scroll, nice and easy!

143
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,260
I won't let you get away!

144
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,638
<i>You're always so late, Naruto!</i>

145
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,934
<i>Absorbing it with my chakra.</i>

146
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:34,610
Sasuke...

147
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,570
Don't just stand there, Sakura!

148
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,489
There's no guarantee this guy's alone!

149
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:40,366
Got it?!

150
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,410
Let your guard down for a second
and you're dead.

151
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:48,457
<i>Unlucky... I came alone
to remain hidden,</i>

152
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,000
<i>but that just backfired...</i>

153
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,091
<i>He got away, huh?</i>

154
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,681
If there's an instance that
we become separated,

155
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,225
don't trust someone just because
they look like one of us.

156
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,644
Just like now there's a possibility

157
00:12:08,814 --> 00:12:11,316
that an enemy will transform
to get close to us!

158
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,024
- Yeah.
- So what do we do?

159
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,652
We'll decide on a password.

160
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,988
Password?

161
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:25,119
Listen, if the password is incorrect,
no matter what he looks like...

162
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,371
presume he is an enemy!

163
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:31,333
I'll only say it once, so listen closely.

164
00:12:32,601 --> 00:12:34,687
You ask:
"Ninja verse, ninja chance."

165
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,630
And the answer is this:

166
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,301
"When enemies are many and their movements
unknown, wait and watch for an opportunity."

167
00:12:40,859 --> 00:12:43,195
"If there are no enemies in a quiet place,
do not conceal your presence."

168
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,932
"For a shinobi, knowing
the right time is everything."

169
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:50,106
"Strike when the enemy is tired and
lets their guard down."

170
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,270
That's it.

171
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:52,855
Okay!

172
00:12:56,512 --> 00:12:58,823
See? Brains are what
matter most for survival!

173
00:12:58,964 --> 00:13:00,364
Right, Akamaru?

174
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:03,960
Lucky for us,

175
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,420
the guys who got caught in
the trap had an Earth scroll!

176
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,507
We'll be the first
to the tower at this rate!

177
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,654
Don't get carried away.

178
00:13:12,489 --> 00:13:13,741
That's dangerous.

179
00:13:14,721 --> 00:13:18,291
Even the smallest insect must
always remain on guard.

180
00:13:19,151 --> 00:13:21,628
We have to pay attention to avoid
coming across any enemies...

181
00:13:22,546 --> 00:13:23,568
This is a path to safety.

182
00:13:23,921 --> 00:13:25,632
I know that!

183
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:29,788
Man, you always talk in riddles. Can't you
just talk like a normal person, you bug freak.

184
00:13:31,142 --> 00:13:32,898
Um... B-But...

185
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,788
What Shino said...

186
00:13:34,993 --> 00:13:36,311
He has a point.

187
00:13:36,962 --> 00:13:38,903
I know! C'mon.

188
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,099
<i>Naruto...
I hope nothing's happened to him...</i>

189
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,415
Hey you two, stop!

190
00:13:50,152 --> 00:13:51,026
<i>Byakugan!</i>

191
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,973
There's someone there.

192
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:04,014
It seems there are... six people...

193
00:14:04,617 --> 00:14:06,684
Okay! Let's go look!

194
00:14:06,983 --> 00:14:07,775
Huh?

195
00:14:08,172 --> 00:14:09,794
Kiba! What are you saying?

196
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,620
We're not doing that.

197
00:14:11,963 --> 00:14:16,489
The proctor said we need one "Heaven"
and one "Earth" scroll to pass.

198
00:14:17,102 --> 00:14:19,791
She didn't say we couldn't
take more than that.

199
00:14:20,498 --> 00:14:26,549
If we take more, that means
some other teams will be left out.

200
00:14:27,373 --> 00:14:28,855
B-But...

201
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,095
We'll just see what's going on first...

202
00:14:31,301 --> 00:14:33,679
If it looks too dangerous,
we won't pick an unnecessary fight.

203
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:35,518
- Let's go!
- Oh!

204
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:41,140
What's up, Akamaru?

205
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:44,373
What happened? You stopped suddenly.

206
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:49,407
Akamaru suddenly got frightened.

207
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,422
Wh-Why is that?

208
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:56,502
Akamaru can gauge an enemy's
strength by the scent of their chakra.

209
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,764
But this is the first time
I've seen him this scared.

210
00:15:00,777 --> 00:15:04,548
The people fighting up ahead
are no ordinary shinobi.

211
00:15:09,272 --> 00:15:13,657
Some brats from the Sand village
are challenging us.

212
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,755
It's foolish.

213
00:15:23,421 --> 00:15:28,116
What's with that redhead?
Picking a fight with those guys...

214
00:15:31,793 --> 00:15:35,450
Hey brats, you should have
chosen your opponents more carefully.

215
00:15:35,991 --> 00:15:37,717
Now, you're all going to die.

216
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:41,557
<i>Which scroll do those guys have...</i>

217
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:43,333
Hey Gaara!

218
00:15:44,228 --> 00:15:47,836
Shouldn't we follow them
and gather information before we attack?

219
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:51,889
If they have the same scroll as us,
there's no point in fighting.

220
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,640
Unnecessary battles are just...

221
00:15:53,665 --> 00:15:54,809
It doesn't matter.

222
00:15:56,265 --> 00:15:57,790
Once they've met my gaze...

223
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,665
I kill them.

224
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,786
Well, let's do it. Quickly!

225
00:16:09,711 --> 00:16:10,919
<i>Die, kid!</i>

226
00:16:11,046 --> 00:16:13,225
<i>Ninja Art: Senbon Rainstorm!</i>

227
00:16:19,197 --> 00:16:21,805
Up, down, right, left – there are
no blind spots with this jutsu.

228
00:16:22,243 --> 00:16:25,470
Not only that, all the senbon
are controlled by my chakra

229
00:16:25,495 --> 00:16:27,539
and attack their intended prey!

230
00:16:37,374 --> 00:16:38,692
Is that all?

231
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:40,734
I-It can't be...

232
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:41,759
Not a single one?

233
00:16:42,045 --> 00:16:44,393
Not a scratch? Impossible!

234
00:16:49,114 --> 00:16:51,025
Senbon Rainstorm, huh?

235
00:16:52,151 --> 00:16:55,773
Then... I'll make it rain blood.

236
00:16:58,171 --> 00:16:59,845
A wall of sand?

237
00:17:00,511 --> 00:17:03,608
You guys can't defeat our Gaara.

238
00:17:04,626 --> 00:17:06,203
Don't underestimate me!

239
00:17:12,228 --> 00:17:14,079
This guy's a goner...

240
00:17:14,621 --> 00:17:16,622
That's what you get
for rebelling against Gaara...

241
00:17:18,048 --> 00:17:19,463
<i>Sand Coffin!</i>

242
00:17:25,981 --> 00:17:27,225
I can't move!

243
00:17:30,588 --> 00:17:31,884
Let me go!

244
00:17:36,091 --> 00:17:39,565
I can cover your loud
mouth and kill you...

245
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:49,262
But that would be no fun at all.

246
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,825
<i>Sand Burial!</i>

247
00:18:28,637 --> 00:18:30,155
There's no pain.

248
00:18:30,821 --> 00:18:34,184
I applied more pressure than necessary
and crushed him to death.

249
00:18:34,877 --> 00:18:36,229
T-The scroll...

250
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:38,131
We'll give it to you!

251
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,070
Please, just let us go!

252
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:50,067
N-No!

253
00:18:57,749 --> 00:18:58,962
This is bad.

254
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:02,388
Let's escape quickly!
If he finds us he'll kill us!

255
00:19:06,748 --> 00:19:08,637
Lucky. It's a Heaven scroll.

256
00:19:09,496 --> 00:19:11,829
Okay. Let's go to the tower.

257
00:19:12,106 --> 00:19:12,958
Shut up.

258
00:19:14,172 --> 00:19:17,335
It's still... not enough.

259
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:22,077
<i>U-Uh oh!
Did he notice us?</i>

260
00:19:23,394 --> 00:19:25,454
Let's quit... Gaara.

261
00:19:27,643 --> 00:19:29,925
Are you scared, coward?

262
00:19:31,401 --> 00:19:32,179
Gaara!

263
00:19:32,637 --> 00:19:37,513
It's certainly no problem for you,
but it's dangerous for us!

264
00:19:38,115 --> 00:19:39,885
One set of scrolls is enough!

265
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,933
More than that, this is...

266
00:19:44,214 --> 00:19:46,941
Don't give me orders, you weakling.

267
00:19:50,215 --> 00:19:51,393
That's enough!

268
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:54,792
Why don't you listen
to your big brother for once?!

269
00:19:55,804 --> 00:19:58,908
I have never once thought of you
as my brother.

270
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,465
If you get in my way... I'll kill you.

271
00:20:09,282 --> 00:20:12,070
G-Gaara, cut it out! Please...

272
00:20:12,173 --> 00:20:14,372
Don't say something so cold.

273
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:18,372
For your sister's sake... Please?

274
00:20:27,244 --> 00:20:28,481
Fine.

275
00:20:38,411 --> 00:20:40,692
<i>This why I hate brats.</i>

276
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,848
What? So that was it, Akamaru?

277
00:20:50,313 --> 00:20:52,698
C'mon, you should've told me sooner!

278
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,015
I'll carry the scroll!

279
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,518
Hey, wait Sasuke.

280
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,644
Ouch!

281
00:21:07,778 --> 00:21:08,612
A new enemy?!

282
00:21:14,034 --> 00:21:17,329
Go on and play around...

283
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:20,624
I'll do this alone...

284
00:21:30,217 --> 00:21:31,010
Sakura!

285
00:21:31,385 --> 00:21:32,344
Sasuke!

286
00:21:32,762 --> 00:21:33,554
Don't come closer!

287
00:21:33,899 --> 00:21:35,400
First the password...

288
00:21:35,973 --> 00:21:37,349
"Ninja verse, ninja chance!"

289
00:21:37,736 --> 00:21:38,946
Ah! Umm...

290
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,786
"When enemies are many and their movements
unknown, wait and watch for an opportunity."

291
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,356
"If there are no enemies in a quiet place,
do not conceal your presence."

292
00:21:45,024 --> 00:21:47,860
"For a shinobi, knowing
the right time is everything."

293
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:50,321
"Strike when the enemy is tired and
lets their guard down."

294
00:21:51,197 --> 00:21:51,989
Good.

295
00:21:52,323 --> 00:21:53,991
Owwww!

296
00:21:54,408 --> 00:21:56,343
Hey, are you two okay?

297
00:21:56,368 --> 00:21:57,787
Naruto, wait!

298
00:21:58,509 --> 00:21:59,308
The password...

299
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,082
"When enemies are many and their movements
unknown, wait and watch for an opportunity."

300
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,835
"If there are no enemies in a quiet place,
do not conceal your presence."

301
00:22:05,211 --> 00:22:08,422
"For a shinobi, knowing
the right time is everything."

302
00:22:08,688 --> 00:22:10,968
"Strike when the enemy is tired and
lets their guard down."

303
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:13,311
- What?!
- Huh?!

304
00:22:14,637 --> 00:22:16,388
What are you doing?!

305
00:22:17,306 --> 00:22:19,725
So, you're someone who
can dodge my attacks, huh?

306
00:22:20,142 --> 00:22:22,144
What are you saying, Sasuke?

307
00:22:22,895 --> 00:22:25,231
Naruto just said
the password properly.

308
00:22:25,606 --> 00:22:27,233
The fact that he could recite it
perfectly is the problem!

309
00:22:27,775 --> 00:22:31,821
There's no way he could
memorize such a long password.

310
00:22:31,946 --> 00:22:32,863
Oh!

311
00:22:36,158 --> 00:22:37,743
That's how it is, huh...

312
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:47,461
But if you knew he would forget it,

313
00:22:49,463 --> 00:22:53,008
why didn't you just make
the password shorter?

314
00:22:53,592 --> 00:22:55,302
I knew that you were
underground

315
00:22:55,594 --> 00:22:59,473
listening to everything we said.

316
00:23:01,016 --> 00:23:04,937
I see. So you're not tired
or letting your guard down.

317
00:23:06,188 --> 00:23:08,983
This might be more fun than I thought.

318
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:14,572
Huh?

319
00:23:15,114 --> 00:23:16,615
Owww

320
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:20,953
And heave!

321
00:23:21,537 --> 00:23:25,332
Huh? Where are Sakura and Sasuke?

322
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:31,672
S-So huge!

323
00:23:33,674 --> 00:23:36,719
<i>This is the first time I've seen...
a snake this huge!</i>

324
00:23:39,847 --> 00:23:40,556
<i>Behind?!</i>

325
00:23:42,766 --> 00:23:43,893
T-Tail!

326
00:24:00,326 --> 00:24:03,370
You want our Earth Scroll,
don't you?

327
00:24:04,038 --> 00:24:07,207
'Cause you have the Heaven Scroll.

328
00:24:15,549 --> 00:24:18,010
Well, let's begin...

329
00:24:18,451 --> 00:24:20,870
the battle for the Scrolls.

330
00:24:23,182 --> 00:24:24,516
A life-or-death battle!

331
00:24:48,207 --> 00:24:49,166
<i>Genjutsu?!</i>

332
00:24:54,672 --> 00:24:55,881
<i>No, that's not it.</i>

333
00:24:57,466 --> 00:25:00,135
<i>This is pure killing intent.</i>

334
00:25:01,053 --> 00:25:02,221
<i>What's going on?</i>

335
00:25:03,514 --> 00:25:07,017
<i>Just by looking in her eyes...
I saw my own death.</i>

336
00:25:08,102 --> 00:25:10,771
<i>Who is this... woman?!</i>

337
00:25:14,233 --> 00:25:16,402
Sa... kura?

338
00:25:22,783 --> 00:25:25,269
<i>If we don't move,
the only thing waiting for us is...</i>

339
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,431
<i>Death!</i>

340
00:25:30,582 --> 00:25:32,418
Can't move already?

341
00:25:34,878 --> 00:25:35,671
<i>She's going to kill me!</i>

342
00:25:36,588 --> 00:25:39,258
<i>Move... move... move!</i>

343
00:25:39,466 --> 00:25:40,384
<i>Move!</i>

344
00:25:41,677 --> 00:25:43,721
<i>Move! Move!</i>

345
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:53,814
<i>Even if it's just a little...
Move!</i>

346
00:25:54,565 --> 00:25:58,027
What do you intend to do... with that?

347
00:25:59,737 --> 00:26:04,158
Don't you worry.
I'll finish this in an instant.

348
00:26:05,868 --> 00:26:07,828
You won't even have
time to feel the pain.

349
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,548
<i>Move!</i>

350
00:26:25,637 --> 00:26:28,307
<i>He's using pain to overcome his fear.</i>

351
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:32,811
<i>Just as I expected,
he's no ordinary prey.</i>

352
00:26:34,646 --> 00:26:37,399
Let me out! Hey!

353
00:26:38,609 --> 00:26:41,153
Spit... me... out!

354
00:26:44,651 --> 00:26:46,368
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

355
00:26:56,376 --> 00:26:59,463
I'm a shinobi who will become Hokage!

356
00:27:00,042 --> 00:27:03,712
I'm not going to die and become
snake food in a place like this!

357
00:27:14,061 --> 00:27:15,938
Sasuke, are you all right?

358
00:27:16,438 --> 00:27:19,483
<i>We have to get away quickly,
or we'll be discovered.</i>

359
00:27:19,817 --> 00:27:22,152
<i>How do we make our escape?
How do we get away?</i>

360
00:27:23,195 --> 00:27:25,989
<i>Sasuke is so shaken up.</i>

361
00:27:26,615 --> 00:27:28,659
<i>I've never seen him like this.</i>

362
00:27:30,244 --> 00:27:31,495
Sasuke, a snake!

363
00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:36,667
<i>I was so distracted;
I didn't even notice the snake.</i>

364
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,941
Stay away!

365
00:28:03,944 --> 00:28:07,823
You can't let your guard down
for even a second.

366
00:28:07,944 --> 00:28:12,407
When you're the prey,
you become tense

367
00:28:13,965 --> 00:28:16,051
before the predator.

368
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,630
I'm sorry, Sasuke...

369
00:28:25,094 --> 00:28:27,138
I forgot the password.

370
00:28:30,554 --> 00:28:31,555
Naruto!

371
00:28:31,763 --> 00:28:33,140
You may think
you're paying me back

372
00:28:33,182 --> 00:28:34,308
by coming here to rescue me...

373
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:35,376
Just stay out of it!

374
00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:37,644
This is way out of your league!

375
00:28:39,146 --> 00:28:42,524
<i>His coming here doesn't help
the situation at all.</i>

376
00:28:43,077 --> 00:28:44,526
<i>What do I do?</i>

377
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:46,976
<i>There's no other way!</i>

378
00:28:55,162 --> 00:28:56,914
I'll give you the scroll.

379
00:28:57,456 --> 00:28:59,958
So please, take it and go.

380
00:29:00,334 --> 00:29:02,586
What?! Sasuke!

381
00:29:02,961 --> 00:29:04,880
Have you gone crazy?!

382
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,591
What's the point of giving
the enemy the scroll?!

383
00:29:08,381 --> 00:29:09,382
I see...

384
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,302
Well, in order to
escape a predator,

385
00:29:12,388 --> 00:29:14,557
the only way for prey to save
itself...

386
00:29:14,582 --> 00:29:16,667
is to offer the predator
a different meal.

387
00:29:17,063 --> 00:29:18,064
Take it!

388
00:29:23,815 --> 00:29:26,026
You jerk! Stop interfering!

389
00:29:26,276 --> 00:29:28,028
Don't you understand
the situation?!

390
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,451
What the hell are you doing?!

391
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:41,156
I forgot the password.

392
00:29:41,522 --> 00:29:43,357
So there's no way I can confirm it.

393
00:29:44,211 --> 00:29:46,630
But you're not the Sasuke I know,
are you?!

394
00:29:47,047 --> 00:29:48,757
You loser...

395
00:29:49,132 --> 00:29:50,592
I'm the real one!

396
00:29:51,093 --> 00:29:52,135
Don't lie!

397
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:57,547
The Sasuke I know isn't a coward
who'd do something so stupid!

398
00:29:58,475 --> 00:30:00,560
I don't know how strong
this guy is.

399
00:30:01,144 --> 00:30:03,438
But where's the guarantee
that she'll let us go

400
00:30:03,463 --> 00:30:04,798
after we give her the scroll?!

401
00:30:05,528 --> 00:30:08,156
You're the one who doesn't
understand the situation

402
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,641
because you're too scared!

403
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:12,531
Naruto...

404
00:30:15,071 --> 00:30:16,114
You are right.

405
00:30:18,166 --> 00:30:19,584
A scroll can be easily...

406
00:30:23,065 --> 00:30:25,275
obtained by killing for it.

407
00:30:27,337 --> 00:30:28,714
Quit joking around!

408
00:30:29,816 --> 00:30:31,401
Stop it! Get out of here, Naruto.

409
00:30:32,843 --> 00:30:34,219
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

410
00:30:38,932 --> 00:30:39,599
Naruto!

411
00:30:39,624 --> 00:30:40,625
Naruto!

412
00:30:48,692 --> 00:30:51,069
For now, stay put.

413
00:30:54,448 --> 00:30:56,616
Damn it! Take this!

414
00:30:59,703 --> 00:31:01,580
That's Naruto?

415
00:31:02,497 --> 00:31:04,041
This brat... impossible!

416
00:31:17,804 --> 00:31:19,431
This is getting interesting.

417
00:31:19,848 --> 00:31:21,725
<i>Sasuke, you're next!</i>

418
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:23,376
What will you do?!

419
00:31:29,827 --> 00:31:33,039
Hey, are you hurt... scaredy-cat?

420
00:31:38,408 --> 00:31:39,785
There are three corpses.

421
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:44,487
This is some kind of jutsu,
isn't it?

422
00:31:45,082 --> 00:31:47,751
This is bad.

423
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:53,548
Inform Anko,
the proctor of the second test.

424
00:31:53,715 --> 00:31:54,424
Yes, sir!

425
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:03,600
You know, when it comes to dango,
nothing beats anko paste!

426
00:32:04,768 --> 00:32:09,731
With this setup, the quicker kids
should clear it soon.

427
00:32:11,358 --> 00:32:13,193
The Leaf Village mark, perfect!

428
00:32:17,531 --> 00:32:19,199
We have a problem, Ms. Anko!

429
00:32:20,033 --> 00:32:22,577
Huh? What, so suddenly?

430
00:32:22,909 --> 00:32:24,555
Corpses! Three of them!

431
00:32:26,753 --> 00:32:28,033
Moreover, they're strange.

432
00:32:28,542 --> 00:32:30,168
Anyway, please come!

433
00:32:33,088 --> 00:32:34,131
Strange?

434
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:49,646
Show me the photos of these three
from the Village Hidden in the Grass.

435
00:32:49,896 --> 00:32:51,148
It's on their applications.

436
00:32:51,231 --> 00:32:52,232
Yes!

437
00:32:55,318 --> 00:32:56,736
<i>So he stole this one's face.</i>

438
00:32:59,489 --> 00:33:01,491
<i>Then, at that time it was already...</i>

439
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,121
<i>I'll return... the kunai.</i>

440
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:08,623
We're in big trouble.

441
00:33:08,832 --> 00:33:09,541
Huh?!

442
00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:13,253
Communicate this to
Lord Hokage right away!

443
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,423
Send for the ANBU Black Ops

444
00:33:16,639 --> 00:33:18,516
to assemble more than two squads
to the Forest of Death!

445
00:33:19,217 --> 00:33:21,511
Starting now,
I'm going to follow these guys!

446
00:33:21,595 --> 00:33:22,387
Got it?

447
00:33:22,471 --> 00:33:23,138
Yes!

448
00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:28,518
<i>That guy...</i>

449
00:33:29,598 --> 00:33:31,809
<i>That man...
he's in the Hidden Leaf Village!</i>

450
00:33:41,656 --> 00:33:42,449
Huh?!

451
00:33:43,963 --> 00:33:47,996
Damn it!
Let me go!

452
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,623
You stupid snake!

453
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:56,630
<i>To think the Nine-Tails kid was
alive all this time...</i>

454
00:33:58,256 --> 00:34:02,928
<i>When he gets excited, a little bit
of the Nine-Tails' power leaks out...</i>

455
00:34:05,722 --> 00:34:08,266
<i>He's grown into quite
an interesting specimen.</i>

456
00:34:09,601 --> 00:34:10,435
<i>Look...</i>

457
00:34:10,936 --> 00:34:13,188
<i>The Seal is appearing on
your skin like a tattoo.</i>

458
00:34:13,438 --> 00:34:16,149
<i>Five-Pronged Seal!</i>

459
00:34:24,533 --> 00:34:26,452
Sasuke! Help Naruto!

460
00:34:37,254 --> 00:34:39,047
<i>Twelve years since the seal...</i>

461
00:34:39,548 --> 00:34:44,636
<i>Naruto's chakra and the Nine-Tails'
chakra are beginning to synchronize...</i>

462
00:34:49,891 --> 00:34:53,395
<i>But now... you're in the way.</i>

463
00:34:57,357 --> 00:34:59,317
<i>He's going to fall at this rate!</i>

464
00:34:59,901 --> 00:35:00,944
Naruto!

465
00:35:04,281 --> 00:35:05,782
What happened Sasuke?!

466
00:35:11,871 --> 00:35:15,208
Naruto's certainly different
from you, Sasuke.

467
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,961
He's reckless and
always messing things up.

468
00:35:18,587 --> 00:35:21,381
But, he's never been a coward!

469
00:35:21,923 --> 00:35:23,925
You know that, don't you?

470
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,847
Just what I'd expect from the Uchiha clan...

471
00:35:34,358 --> 00:35:36,736
His blood has begun to stir...

472
00:35:37,939 --> 00:35:41,735
I should take my time and
confirm his true power.

473
00:35:44,689 --> 00:35:47,442
<i>But it's me who was being stupid.</i>

474
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,771
<i>Naruto!</i>

475
00:35:48,852 --> 00:35:49,603
<i>Sakura!</i>

476
00:35:49,884 --> 00:35:52,613
<i>How can someone who can't put his life
on the line at a place like this...</i>

477
00:35:52,638 --> 00:35:54,335
<i>defeat that man?!</i>

478
00:36:20,497 --> 00:36:21,165
<i>I can see.</i>

479
00:36:36,588 --> 00:36:37,297
<i>I can see!</i>

480
00:36:39,158 --> 00:36:40,118
<i>I can see you!</i>

481
00:37:03,975 --> 00:37:05,184
<i>It's pretty good...</i>

482
00:37:06,019 --> 00:37:07,437
<i>You can see my moves, can't you?</i>

483
00:37:19,532 --> 00:37:20,909
I got you!

484
00:37:36,633 --> 00:37:37,592
A substitution!

485
00:37:58,024 --> 00:37:58,859
Sasuke!

486
00:38:04,205 --> 00:38:06,374
Humph!
That was too easy.

487
00:38:07,121 --> 00:38:09,165
You bring shame to the Uchiha name.

488
00:38:09,813 --> 00:38:10,772
That's okay.

489
00:38:10,899 --> 00:38:14,152
I'll just take my time and play
with you before I kill you...

490
00:38:15,546 --> 00:38:17,298
Like a worm.

491
00:38:37,026 --> 00:38:38,653
<i> Fire Style: Dragon Flame Jutsu!</i>

492
00:38:50,331 --> 00:38:51,499
He did it!

493
00:39:00,591 --> 00:39:01,592
Sasuke!

494
00:39:02,927 --> 00:39:03,678
You did it!

495
00:39:07,515 --> 00:39:08,391
You okay?

496
00:39:09,269 --> 00:39:10,228
Hang on.

497
00:39:22,947 --> 00:39:23,990
Paralysis?

498
00:39:25,223 --> 00:39:27,934
You are truly a member
of the Uchiha clan.

499
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:31,372
I do want you, after all.

500
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,986
You're definitely his brother.

501
00:39:38,385 --> 00:39:41,847
Your eyes hold more potential
than even Itachi's.

502
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,302
Who in the world are you?

503
00:39:50,011 --> 00:39:52,013
My name is Orochimaru...

504
00:39:52,810 --> 00:40:01,069
If you wish to see me again, you'll have
to fight your way through this exam.

505
00:40:01,611 --> 00:40:03,488
- The Scroll!
- Defeat the three...

506
00:40:03,571 --> 00:40:06,074
Sound ninja under my command.

507
00:40:06,694 --> 00:40:08,696
You're not making any sense!

508
00:40:09,243 --> 00:40:12,872
We don't want to see
your face ever again, got it?!

509
00:40:14,916 --> 00:40:16,626
That won't do.

510
00:40:39,816 --> 00:40:40,900
Sasuke!

511
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,320
You, what did you do to Sasuke?

512
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:48,187
I gave him a parting gift.

513
00:40:48,577 --> 00:40:51,413
Sasuke will undoubtedly
come looking for me...

514
00:40:51,714 --> 00:40:53,507
seeking power.

515
00:40:54,288 --> 00:40:58,584
You've provided me with plenty
of entertainment.

516
00:41:10,827 --> 00:41:12,287
<i>The sun will set soon...</i>

517
00:41:14,028 --> 00:41:15,279
<i>I must find him quickly!</i>

518
00:41:16,347 --> 00:41:19,850
<i>Once it's completely dark,
my disadvantage will only increase.</i>

519
00:41:21,289 --> 00:41:26,195
<i>But why now, of all times...
what's his goal?</i>

520
00:41:31,855 --> 00:41:32,731
Sasuke!

521
00:41:35,268 --> 00:41:37,039
Hold on, Sasuke.

522
00:41:37,832 --> 00:41:38,624
C'mon!

523
00:41:43,129 --> 00:41:44,380
Sasuke...

524
00:41:49,434 --> 00:41:51,304
Sasuke, c'mon!

525
00:41:51,891 --> 00:41:53,059
Sasuke...

526
00:41:57,945 --> 00:41:59,238
Naruto!

527
00:41:59,263 --> 00:42:02,523
Sasuke's... Sasuke's hurt!

528
00:42:06,819 --> 00:42:07,945
What?

529
00:42:09,706 --> 00:42:11,624
What should I do?

530
00:42:26,556 --> 00:42:27,849
It's been a while...

531
00:42:29,017 --> 00:42:29,809
Anko.

532
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:32,186
You're an S-rank criminal,

533
00:42:32,211 --> 00:42:34,380
an extremely dangerous person on
the most wanted list.

534
00:42:36,066 --> 00:42:37,166
Orochimaru!

535
00:42:37,692 --> 00:42:38,568
You can't win.

536
00:42:51,372 --> 00:42:52,623
<i>Striking Shadow Snakes!</i>

537
00:43:00,214 --> 00:43:01,507
I won't let you escape.

538
00:43:14,771 --> 00:43:15,938
I got you.

539
00:43:16,939 --> 00:43:19,734
Orochimaru,
I'm going to borrow your left hand.

540
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:23,614
You and I are
going to die here.

541
00:43:27,784 --> 00:43:30,912
You intend to commit suicide?

542
00:43:42,548 --> 00:43:43,800
Substitution.

543
00:44:00,733 --> 00:44:04,529
As you are a special Jonin
of the village.

544
00:44:05,029 --> 00:44:08,699
Surely you wouldn't use the
Forbidden Jutsu I taught you... on me.

545
00:44:12,286 --> 00:44:14,163
I told you it wouldn't work.

546
00:44:24,966 --> 00:44:26,966
A little while ago,

547
00:44:27,313 --> 00:44:29,991
I gave that same Curse Mark
as a gift.

548
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:33,141
There's a kid that I want.

549
00:44:34,684 --> 00:44:36,394
Selfish as always.

550
00:44:36,894 --> 00:44:38,271
That kid will die.

551
00:44:39,272 --> 00:44:43,151
Certainly... the odds that he'll die
are 1 in 10,

552
00:44:43,484 --> 00:44:47,155
but he may survive just like you did.

553
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:50,700
You've really taken a liking
to this kid, haven't you?

554
00:44:51,159 --> 00:44:54,203
Unlike you, that kid will excel.

555
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:58,332
For one thing, he has inherited
the Uchiha's visual prowess.

556
00:45:00,376 --> 00:45:04,672
He has beautiful features and
is an ideal vessel to become my heir.

557
00:45:05,464 --> 00:45:09,093
If that kid lives,
it will make things interesting.

558
00:45:09,844 --> 00:45:13,306
Be sure not to cancel this test.

559
00:45:15,433 --> 00:45:18,436
Three people from my village
are also under your care.

560
00:45:19,353 --> 00:45:21,063
Do try to entertain me.

561
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:32,918
We've secured food and water after
spending half a day

562
00:45:33,326 --> 00:45:36,287
so most teams have stopped
moving by now.

563
00:45:37,889 --> 00:45:40,350
As we planned,
this is the time that we attack.

564
00:45:40,898 --> 00:45:43,401
We'll split up into three and go scouting.

565
00:45:43,554 --> 00:45:47,099
However, whether we find
other teams or not,

566
00:45:47,543 --> 00:45:49,879
we return to this place.

567
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:51,630
Got it?

568
00:45:52,371 --> 00:45:53,205
Okay.

569
00:45:53,346 --> 00:45:54,305
Roger.

570
00:45:55,097 --> 00:45:55,806
Okay.

571
00:45:56,224 --> 00:45:56,849
Scatter!

572
00:46:05,146 --> 00:46:07,649
His breathing is gradually
becoming regular...

573
00:46:08,277 --> 00:46:10,279
but he still has a terrible fever.

574
00:46:14,128 --> 00:46:15,921
<i>I have to protect them both.</i>

575
00:46:17,078 --> 00:46:20,748
Lord Orochimaru ordered us to wait
until daybreak.

576
00:46:21,832 --> 00:46:24,669
Sasuke Uchiha is our target,
not the others.

577
00:46:25,424 --> 00:46:28,927
If they get in the way,
it's okay to kill the other two, right?

578
00:46:29,371 --> 00:46:30,122
Of course.

579
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,511
<i>I can't fall asleep...</i>

580
00:47:21,183 --> 00:47:22,476
<i>Is it daybreak already?!</i>

581
00:47:34,155 --> 00:47:35,031
<i>A squirrel?</i>

582
00:47:35,633 --> 00:47:38,469
<i>Don't surprise me like that!</i>

583
00:47:38,909 --> 00:47:39,660
Oh!

584
00:47:43,581 --> 00:47:44,915
<i>That was too close.</i>

585
00:47:45,853 --> 00:47:47,188
Do you think she noticed?

586
00:47:47,585 --> 00:47:49,587
The Paper Bomb we put on the squirrel...

587
00:47:49,857 --> 00:47:51,817
No, that's not it.

588
00:47:52,266 --> 00:47:55,686
Huh? Then what? What was it?

589
00:47:55,972 --> 00:47:58,475
We'll probably find out if we go closer.

590
00:47:59,803 --> 00:48:02,972
So... we should get going now.

591
00:48:18,408 --> 00:48:19,257
Okay!

592
00:48:20,326 --> 00:48:24,121
<i>If I can catch all twenty of these leaves
before they hit the ground</i>

593
00:48:24,711 --> 00:48:27,808
<i>Sakura will fall for me!</i>

594
00:48:27,833 --> 00:48:30,920
<i>If... if I can't catch
every one of these falling leaves...</i>

595
00:48:31,545 --> 00:48:33,923
<i>It'll be an unrequited love forever!
Or rather...</i>

596
00:48:34,586 --> 00:48:36,484
One, two, three, four...
five, six, seven, eight...

597
00:48:36,509 --> 00:48:38,844
nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen,
fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen,

598
00:48:38,928 --> 00:48:42,681
Ugh! Nineteen...

599
00:48:43,891 --> 00:48:44,892
Just one more!

600
00:48:48,479 --> 00:48:49,146
That's...!

601
00:48:56,237 --> 00:48:58,232
Phew... just in time.

602
00:48:59,813 --> 00:49:03,317
This is a paper bomb,
and it's set to explode.

603
00:49:04,528 --> 00:49:06,405
Who did such an awful thing?

604
00:49:09,875 --> 00:49:11,627
Stop hiding and come out.

605
00:49:12,795 --> 00:49:15,890
Ugh! And we went to all that trouble
to stay hidden!

606
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:19,635
Man, he's such a pain!
We've been discovered!

607
00:49:20,053 --> 00:49:23,681
Strategy One, "hide and let it pass,"
was a failure!

608
00:49:24,098 --> 00:49:26,767
So now we carry out Strategy Two!

609
00:49:26,809 --> 00:49:29,687
Huh? Are you serious?

610
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:32,367
What? You have a problem with that?

611
00:49:32,568 --> 00:49:34,570
There's no question of success.

612
00:49:35,376 --> 00:49:37,670
Well, I guess it's all right but...

613
00:49:38,821 --> 00:49:45,138
Wow! To meet the top rookie from last year,
Neji Hyuga, here of all places!

614
00:49:45,163 --> 00:49:47,582
C-Can I have your autograph?

615
00:49:47,696 --> 00:49:49,406
So it's just you guys?

616
00:49:49,832 --> 00:49:54,170
<i>Take that! Strategy Two:
"Fall for My Seductive Charm"!</i>

617
00:49:54,753 --> 00:50:00,509
I'd been wanting to meet you
for some time, you know?

618
00:50:00,676 --> 00:50:01,385
Get lost!

619
00:50:04,472 --> 00:50:07,850
<i>Why? Why doesn't my seductive charm work?!</i>

620
00:50:07,875 --> 00:50:11,587
<i>Ugh, I'm seriously so ticked off!</i>

621
00:50:14,122 --> 00:50:18,669
You raised your fist at me.
Does that mean you want a fight?

622
00:50:18,694 --> 00:50:23,199
N-No...
Of course not.

623
00:50:23,949 --> 00:50:25,034
Then get lost.

624
00:50:25,635 --> 00:50:29,013
Taking a scroll from cowardly wimps
like you

625
00:50:29,218 --> 00:50:31,515
would only bring shame upon the Leaf.

626
00:50:31,613 --> 00:50:33,323
Y-Yes!

627
00:50:34,376 --> 00:50:37,129
Hmph... Pathetic. Just like cockroaches.

628
00:50:38,756 --> 00:50:41,926
All right! Let's go find some wimps!

629
00:50:43,219 --> 00:50:46,597
<i>Like I've been saying,
there's no one wimpier than us...</i>

630
00:50:56,482 --> 00:50:58,442
So, an all-night watch?

631
00:50:59,151 --> 00:51:01,070
But it's not necessary anymore.

632
00:51:01,904 --> 00:51:07,034
Wake Sasuke up.
We've come to fight him.

633
00:51:07,509 --> 00:51:08,802
What are you saying?

634
00:51:08,887 --> 00:51:10,681
What is it you're after?

635
00:51:11,002 --> 00:51:14,005
I know that someone named Orochimaru
is pulling your strings from the shadows!

636
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:15,042
Huh?!

637
00:51:15,751 --> 00:51:18,170
What's that strange mark on
the back of Sasuke's neck?

638
00:51:19,057 --> 00:51:21,006
You did this to Sasuke.

639
00:51:21,143 --> 00:51:22,644
How can you say you want to fight him?!

640
00:51:23,592 --> 00:51:28,322
I wonder... what he is planning?

641
00:51:29,989 --> 00:51:33,435
However, I can't stay quiet
after hearing that.

642
00:51:35,563 --> 00:51:36,855
Wait, Zaku.

643
00:51:37,147 --> 00:51:38,482
Huh? What is it?

644
00:51:42,202 --> 00:51:43,787
It's so cliché.

645
00:51:44,321 --> 00:51:47,199
The color of freshly dug earth.

646
00:51:47,533 --> 00:51:50,578
This grass, it doesn't grow in
a place like this, does it?

647
00:51:50,869 --> 00:51:51,620
<i>Damn!</i>

648
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:53,998
Huh, how ridiculous!

649
00:51:54,331 --> 00:51:58,752
So that kunai was to stop the squirrel
from getting caught in the trap?

650
00:51:59,461 --> 00:52:00,671
We kill her now!

651
00:52:04,717 --> 00:52:05,384
A log?!

652
00:52:05,551 --> 00:52:06,969
Or so you thought.

653
00:52:09,179 --> 00:52:10,097
What?!

654
00:52:10,472 --> 00:52:12,891
Clearly you have no talent.

655
00:52:14,643 --> 00:52:15,769
<i>Leaf Hurricane!</i>

656
00:52:20,983 --> 00:52:23,193
What?! This guy...

657
00:52:24,111 --> 00:52:27,364
You should at least try
to pull your weight!

658
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:29,617
Who are you?

659
00:52:29,969 --> 00:52:33,598
I am the Hidden Leaf's
Beautiful Green Beast, Rock Lee!

660
00:52:37,267 --> 00:52:38,310
Or should I say...

661
00:52:38,435 --> 00:52:41,939
This was for you. Now, get to safety.

662
00:52:46,581 --> 00:52:49,960
And right now, I'm your opponent!

663
00:52:50,387 --> 00:52:52,139
I told you this once before, didn't I?

664
00:52:54,473 --> 00:52:56,266
That I would protect you with my life.

665
00:53:00,189 --> 00:53:01,857
I guess it can't be helped...

666
00:53:02,524 --> 00:53:05,819
Zaku. You can have Sasuke.

667
00:53:07,248 --> 00:53:09,251
I'll kill them!

668
00:53:10,571 --> 00:53:13,865
<i>As far as I can tell,
Sakura is in no condition to fight.</i>

669
00:53:15,001 --> 00:53:18,374
<i>That guy with the bushy brows is
pretty good with his taijutsu...</i>

670
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:20,292
<i>Looks like I can have some fun!</i>

671
00:53:26,965 --> 00:53:30,302
There's a trick to your attack,
isn't there?

672
00:53:30,835 --> 00:53:32,461
I won't just evade it.

673
00:53:33,791 --> 00:53:36,154
You've already shown me your jutsu.

674
00:53:36,642 --> 00:53:37,768
<i>Having said that,</i>

675
00:53:37,851 --> 00:53:39,645
<i>the odds aren't good since
it's one versus three.</i>

676
00:53:39,889 --> 00:53:41,563
<i>I'm going to have to take a chance.</i>

677
00:53:45,401 --> 00:53:46,402
<i>One person at a time...</i>

678
00:53:46,427 --> 00:53:48,000
<i>I'll give it my all and
take them down one by one!</i>

679
00:53:59,957 --> 00:54:01,333
Huh?!

680
00:54:02,334 --> 00:54:04,336
Hey! Sasuke has collapsed...

681
00:54:04,432 --> 00:54:05,016
Huh?!

682
00:54:05,212 --> 00:54:07,423
... and Sakura is fighting.

683
00:54:07,673 --> 00:54:08,757
What did you say?

684
00:54:12,453 --> 00:54:13,287
Hey!

685
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:16,378
He's late.

686
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,728
That Lee...

687
00:54:18,734 --> 00:54:19,985
Something's not right.

688
00:54:20,155 --> 00:54:22,866
He's always precise about time.

689
00:54:23,975 --> 00:54:25,769
Perhaps he ran into the enemy...

690
00:54:27,609 --> 00:54:28,569
Could it be?

691
00:54:29,486 --> 00:54:31,947
Hmm, that's unlikely.

692
00:54:33,031 --> 00:54:35,242
In any case, let's find Lee!

693
00:54:35,659 --> 00:54:36,452
Right!

694
00:54:39,455 --> 00:54:40,414
Guy-sensei...

695
00:54:41,123 --> 00:54:44,293
I will use that jutsu without
holding back!

696
00:54:45,486 --> 00:54:47,503
Because this is the time you spoke of...

697
00:54:47,528 --> 00:54:49,988
"When you are protecting
someone precious to you!"

698
00:54:50,758 --> 00:54:51,592
He disappeared?!

699
00:54:54,011 --> 00:54:55,012
It's just the beginning.

700
00:55:00,309 --> 00:55:02,060
He has no way to break his fall!

701
00:55:02,644 --> 00:55:04,229
Take this!

702
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,898
<i>Primary Lotus!</i>

703
00:55:11,987 --> 00:55:13,030
<i>This feeling...</i>

704
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:16,658
Just in time.

705
00:55:23,373 --> 00:55:24,500
T-That's impossible!

706
00:55:25,542 --> 00:55:27,669
That's a fearsome jutsu...

707
00:55:28,016 --> 00:55:31,465
To do this much damage,
even on soft ground...

708
00:55:32,841 --> 00:55:35,344
Now, it's my turn.

709
00:55:36,136 --> 00:55:38,263
<i>Oh no! With what I just did...</i>

710
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:39,598
<i>my body still isn't...</i>

711
00:55:42,976 --> 00:55:45,854
Your jutsu is indeed fast.

712
00:55:48,524 --> 00:55:53,153
But our jutsu surpasses yours.
It's the speed of sound itself!

713
00:55:55,072 --> 00:55:55,864
Lee!

714
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:02,610
<i>My left ear...</i>

715
00:56:06,336 --> 00:56:07,420
It's sound.

716
00:56:08,046 --> 00:56:12,133
Even though you evaded my fist,
sound assaulted you.

717
00:56:12,881 --> 00:56:13,757
Sound?

718
00:56:14,341 --> 00:56:15,342
Vibration?

719
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:20,761
That's right. In other words,
to hear a sound means,

720
00:56:21,458 --> 00:56:26,629
that the eardrum captures
the vibrations in the air.

721
00:56:30,116 --> 00:56:34,913
You won't be able to move your body
freely for some time.

722
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:40,409
An outdated art like taijutsu
is useless against us.

723
00:56:42,386 --> 00:56:44,888
Well, since I've even gone this far

724
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:47,153
to show you my jutsu...

725
00:56:47,499 --> 00:56:49,751
Don't think you're getting off easy.

726
00:56:50,919 --> 00:56:54,131
This isn't like your worthless techniques.

727
00:56:58,228 --> 00:56:59,229
Next is...

728
00:56:59,636 --> 00:57:00,596
You!

729
00:57:01,013 --> 00:57:01,722
<i>He's coming!</i>

730
00:57:02,973 --> 00:57:03,640
What?!

731
00:57:03,724 --> 00:57:04,433
No way!

732
00:57:04,808 --> 00:57:05,726
<i>Leaf...</i>

733
00:57:05,751 --> 00:57:06,586
<i>Hurricane!</i>

734
00:57:07,603 --> 00:57:10,981
It seems the effect of my last attack
hasn't worn off.

735
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:14,067
I'm somewhat surprised...

736
00:57:17,237 --> 00:57:22,117
This device on my arm amplifies
and projects powerful sound waves.

737
00:57:22,409 --> 00:57:24,411
It's basically a speaker!

738
00:57:25,203 --> 00:57:28,498
And the sound I attack with isn't limited
to the direction of my arm...

739
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:33,635
my chakra ensures it converges
on my target!

740
00:57:34,087 --> 00:57:34,880
Lee!

741
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:43,972
Oh well.

742
00:57:45,448 --> 00:57:48,617
Even Lee was taken down.
Now, Sakura's all alone.

743
00:57:49,036 --> 00:57:51,663
What are you going to do, Ino?

744
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,053
What do you mean?

745
00:57:55,432 --> 00:57:57,892
Well, Sakura's in deep trouble!

746
00:57:58,190 --> 00:57:59,525
And you're just going
to let that happen?

747
00:57:59,824 --> 00:58:00,658
Huh?!

748
00:58:01,458 --> 00:58:04,044
You two were once close friends,
weren't you?

749
00:58:05,661 --> 00:58:07,704
Hey, Ino!

750
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:10,165
What are you going to do?!

751
00:58:10,618 --> 00:58:13,663
I know, but what am I supposed to do?!

752
00:58:13,762 --> 00:58:15,847
I can't just go rushing out there.

753
00:58:18,298 --> 00:58:20,050
<i>Even if I went out now...</i>

754
00:58:22,173 --> 00:58:24,842
<i>I'd be taken down without a doubt.</i>

755
00:58:26,515 --> 00:58:27,474
I also...!

756
00:58:34,356 --> 00:58:36,733
Your hair's shinier than mine.

757
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:40,862
Hey! If you have time to worry
about your hair,

758
00:58:40,904 --> 00:58:42,197
you should practice!

759
00:58:42,864 --> 00:58:45,033
Preening like some girly-girl...

760
00:58:45,826 --> 00:58:51,790
Zaku, how about you kill Sasuke
right in front of this cute little pest?

761
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,875
Yeah! That sounds great!

762
00:58:54,459 --> 00:58:55,627
Hey, hey...

763
00:58:56,253 --> 00:58:57,879
<i>I won't let you!</i>

764
00:58:58,463 --> 00:58:59,381
Don't move!

765
00:59:02,259 --> 00:59:03,218
Sakura.

766
00:59:05,137 --> 00:59:09,683
<i>My body... It has no strength.</i>

767
00:59:12,477 --> 00:59:13,729
So...

768
00:59:13,948 --> 00:59:14,908
Let's do this!

769
00:59:24,865 --> 00:59:27,659
Hey! They're going after
Sasuke and Naruto next!

770
00:59:28,118 --> 00:59:30,370
<i>Wh-What should I do?!</i>

771
00:59:46,762 --> 00:59:48,138
<i>I always...</i>

772
00:59:49,795 --> 00:59:52,715
<i>act as if I'm a full-fledged ninja.</i>

773
00:59:54,981 --> 00:59:58,234
<i>All I ever do is talk about
how much I like Sasuke.</i>

774
01:00:00,776 --> 01:00:04,029
<i>I'm always acting like a know-it-all
and lecturing Naruto.</i>

775
01:00:06,323 --> 01:00:11,593
<i>I've always just... watched them from behind.</i>

776
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,166
<i>And yet...</i>

777
01:00:19,799 --> 01:00:20,800
<i>This time...</i>

778
01:00:21,012 --> 01:00:22,513
<i>I want all of you...</i>

779
01:00:24,591 --> 01:00:26,176
<i>to watch me...</i>

780
01:00:28,232 --> 01:00:29,734
<i>... from behind!</i>

781
01:00:32,474 --> 01:00:33,308
<i>Sakura?</i>

782
01:00:34,931 --> 01:00:35,765
Sakura...

783
01:00:37,521 --> 01:00:38,438
Kin! Kill her!

784
01:00:44,611 --> 01:00:45,821
<i>Substitution Jutsu!</i>

785
01:00:46,154 --> 01:00:47,197
Kin, get out of the way!

786
01:00:48,698 --> 01:00:49,533
Useless!

787
01:00:49,783 --> 01:00:50,951
<i>Slicing Sound Wave!</i>

788
01:00:56,504 --> 01:00:58,423
This is more than enough for you!

789
01:01:00,293 --> 01:01:01,628
Where next?

790
01:01:03,421 --> 01:01:03,922
Huh?!

791
01:01:04,794 --> 01:01:07,172
<i>This time... it's not a substitution!</i>

792
01:01:12,724 --> 01:01:14,226
Get off me! Hey!

793
01:01:19,065 --> 01:01:20,066
<i>Sakura...</i>

794
01:01:24,276 --> 01:01:25,277
<i>Sakura...</i>

795
01:01:26,656 --> 01:01:30,202
<i>I've heard you like Sasuke, too, Ino.</i>

796
01:01:32,075 --> 01:01:34,411
<i>From now on, we're rivals.</i>

797
01:01:38,915 --> 01:01:41,585
<i>Your hair. It's grown quite a bit.</i>

798
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:43,336
<i>Ino...</i>

799
01:01:44,087 --> 01:01:44,963
<i>Why...</i>

800
01:01:46,851 --> 01:01:50,563
<i>Why are you on the
same team as Sasuke?!</i>

801
01:01:51,428 --> 01:01:54,347
<i>I will not lose anymore... to you, Ino!</i>

802
01:01:55,182 --> 01:02:01,771
<i>Me too! I won't lose to you, Sakura.
No matter what!</i>

803
01:02:18,788 --> 01:02:19,831
<i>... Sakura!</i>

804
01:02:34,262 --> 01:02:37,182
<i>I must... protect everyone!</i>

805
01:02:38,363 --> 01:02:39,550
You brat!

806
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:45,690
Huh?

807
01:02:47,442 --> 01:02:51,488
Sakura! I promised
I wouldn't lose to you, didn't I?!

808
01:02:54,699 --> 01:02:56,785
Sorry to get you involved.

809
01:02:57,051 --> 01:02:59,095
We're a three-man squad, after all.

810
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:01,039
We're all in this together, aren't we?

811
01:03:01,381 --> 01:03:03,467
Well, we'll see.

812
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,878
No! I don't want to die yet!

813
01:03:07,003 --> 01:03:08,255
Let go of my scarf!

814
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:10,490
You're annoying! Stop squirming!

815
01:03:12,218 --> 01:03:15,974
You can just drop out, fatso.

816
01:03:17,488 --> 01:03:20,324
What did that guy just say?

817
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,916
I... didn't quite catch it.

818
01:03:24,562 --> 01:03:26,982
<i>That's the one word
you never say to Choji.</i>

819
01:03:27,364 --> 01:03:31,360
I said if you don't like it,
get lost, fatso.

820
01:03:31,385 --> 01:03:34,722
<i>Fatso... fatso... fatso... fatso... fatso</i>

821
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:39,553
Don't call me fat! I'm just big-boned,
you bastard!

822
01:03:40,495 --> 01:03:42,956
All right! You understand this, right?!

823
01:03:43,279 --> 01:03:45,948
This is a battle between
the Leaf and the Sound!

824
01:03:47,919 --> 01:03:49,337
<i>Lucky! He's lost it!</i>

825
01:03:50,046 --> 01:03:52,882
Man, what a drag.
This is going to be a pain.

826
01:03:53,717 --> 01:03:55,468
That's my line.

827
01:03:56,261 --> 01:03:57,804
Formation Ino!

828
01:03:57,887 --> 01:03:59,306
- Shika!
- Cho!

829
01:03:59,514 --> 01:04:00,473
<i>Expansion Jutsu!</i>

830
01:04:01,891 --> 01:04:04,019
And now, Leaf Style Taijutsu!

831
01:04:10,191 --> 01:04:11,860
<i>Human Boulder!</i>

832
01:04:14,779 --> 01:04:16,072
What is this jutsu?

833
01:04:16,445 --> 01:04:18,614
Isn't that just a fat guy rolling around?

834
01:04:19,159 --> 01:04:20,785
<i>Slicing Sound Wave!</i>

835
01:04:29,711 --> 01:04:30,587
<i>He jumped?!</i>

836
01:04:32,464 --> 01:04:33,965
<i>The wind pressure of my
Slicing Sound Wave</i>

837
01:04:34,007 --> 01:04:35,925
<i>is less effective
against his rotation.</i>

838
01:04:36,261 --> 01:04:40,306
<i>Even if I use the Super Sound Wave,
if that thing touches me,</i>

839
01:04:40,471 --> 01:04:42,515
<i>the bones in my arms will be crushed!</i>

840
01:04:44,184 --> 01:04:45,185
<i>Think I'll let you?!</i>

841
01:04:45,392 --> 01:04:47,937
<i>You're the most annoying one, so...</i>

842
01:04:48,294 --> 01:04:49,253
<i>Ninja Art:</i>

843
01:04:49,456 --> 01:04:50,791
<i>Shadow Possession Jutsu!</i>

844
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,651
<i>My body!</i>

845
01:04:53,735 --> 01:04:54,402
<i>Huh?!</i>

846
01:05:01,212 --> 01:05:01,921
Dosu?!

847
01:05:02,037 --> 01:05:03,831
What are you doing at a time like this?!

848
01:05:09,476 --> 01:05:11,311
<i>Shadow Paralysis Jutsu, huh?</i>

849
01:05:12,849 --> 01:05:15,268
Ino, you're up. It's a woman's fight.

850
01:05:15,315 --> 01:05:19,319
Shikamaru, I'm counting on you
to guard my body.

851
01:05:19,344 --> 01:05:20,178
Gotcha!

852
01:05:20,432 --> 01:05:21,012
Huh?

853
01:05:21,756 --> 01:05:23,973
<i>Ninja Art: Mind Transfer Jutsu!</i>

854
01:05:31,439 --> 01:05:32,315
Kin!

855
01:05:34,611 --> 01:05:35,610
What happened?

856
01:05:37,101 --> 01:05:38,478
This is the end of the line.

857
01:05:39,674 --> 01:05:42,909
Make a move, and this girl,
Kin, is dead!

858
01:05:43,365 --> 01:05:45,036
If you don't want this
to end right here,

859
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:47,455
leave your scroll and walk away!

860
01:05:47,956 --> 01:05:51,361
Once you're far enough away that
I can't sense your chakra,

861
01:05:51,386 --> 01:05:53,554
I'll release this girl!

862
01:05:58,133 --> 01:05:59,050
Ino!

863
01:05:59,926 --> 01:06:02,554
Uggghh. I'm dizzy.

864
01:06:05,098 --> 01:06:09,519
Wh-What kind of person...
would hurt their own teammates?

865
01:06:12,021 --> 01:06:13,314
Careless.

866
01:06:13,773 --> 01:06:20,822
Our goal isn't the scrolls or
even passing this test.

867
01:06:22,013 --> 01:06:22,931
What?

868
01:06:23,283 --> 01:06:24,659
It's Sasuke.

869
01:06:25,994 --> 01:06:26,995
Hmph...

870
01:06:28,246 --> 01:06:29,622
<i>My jutsu...</i>

871
01:06:29,950 --> 01:06:32,453
So your precious
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu

872
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:34,727
only lasts for five minutes?

873
01:06:34,832 --> 01:06:38,002
It's not Shadow Paralysis Jutsu,
it's Shadow Possession Jutsu!

874
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,045
In addition, it seems that
this girl's jutsu...

875
01:06:41,384 --> 01:06:46,681
is a jutsu that
seizes an opponent's consciousness.

876
01:06:47,182 --> 01:06:49,100
From the looks of the blood
she's spitting up,

877
01:06:49,142 --> 01:06:52,812
if I kill Kin, that girl will die too...

878
01:06:53,188 --> 01:06:55,648
Are you going to kill...
your own teammate?

879
01:06:56,446 --> 01:06:58,588
If I need to...

880
01:07:01,441 --> 01:07:03,085
That's too bad...

881
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:05,722
Your strategy is flawed.

882
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:07,730
You're too soft.

883
01:07:08,587 --> 01:07:09,534
Hmph!

884
01:07:09,558 --> 01:07:10,648
I don't like this at all...

885
01:07:12,019 --> 01:07:14,571
You pathetic Sound Ninja...

886
01:07:14,596 --> 01:07:18,267
acting all triumphant just for beating
some second-rate opponents?

887
01:07:18,447 --> 01:07:19,198
What?!

888
01:07:20,613 --> 01:07:23,354
They're Lee's teammates...

889
01:07:26,163 --> 01:07:29,834
That guy with the bowl cut lying over there...
he's our teammate.

890
01:07:31,168 --> 01:07:32,753
This was your doing, wasn't it?!

891
01:07:35,731 --> 01:07:38,984
If you're going to keep this up,
I'll fight you with my full strength!

892
01:07:40,469 --> 01:07:41,011
Huh?

893
01:07:41,762 --> 01:07:43,347
What's wrong? Neji...

894
01:07:45,307 --> 01:07:49,437
If you've got a problem, then stop
acting so cool and get down here!

895
01:07:50,003 --> 01:07:53,715
No. Evidently, there's no need for that.

896
01:08:00,781 --> 01:08:02,560
Sasuke! You're awake...

897
01:08:02,584 --> 01:08:03,284
Huh?!

898
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:12,501
Sakura...

899
01:08:13,252 --> 01:08:15,921
Who did this to you?

900
01:08:17,506 --> 01:08:18,716
Who is it?

901
01:08:18,883 --> 01:08:19,758
Me!

902
01:08:21,469 --> 01:08:22,344
Ino!

903
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:24,221
If you stay like that
you're going to get involved!

904
01:08:24,430 --> 01:08:26,015
Come back to your body!

905
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,603
Choji, you too,
come over here and hide.

906
01:08:28,817 --> 01:08:30,110
Y-Yeah.

907
01:08:30,436 --> 01:08:31,604
<i>Uh oh.</i>

908
01:08:32,287 --> 01:08:33,454
<i>Release!</i>

909
01:08:37,709 --> 01:08:38,961
<i>Wha?!</i>

910
01:08:38,986 --> 01:08:41,489
<i>Wh-What's this?</i>

911
01:08:41,947 --> 01:08:43,449
<i>No matter...</i>

912
01:08:44,658 --> 01:08:45,993
<i>how you look at it...</i>

913
01:08:47,536 --> 01:08:48,662
<i>his chakra is...</i>

914
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:50,998
<i>immense!</i>

915
01:08:52,291 --> 01:08:55,419
Dosu, this half-dead bastard
is nothing to be afraid of!

916
01:08:55,961 --> 01:08:58,088
Stop, Zaku! Don't you understand?!

917
01:08:59,173 --> 01:09:00,883
<i>Super Sonic Slicing Wave!</i>

918
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,416
Heh! He must have been blown to pieces.

919
01:09:16,541 --> 01:09:17,834
- Who was?
- Huh?!

920
01:09:21,445 --> 01:09:22,363
<i>Fire Style:</i>

921
01:09:22,446 --> 01:09:23,697
<i>Phoenix Flower Jutsu!</i>

922
01:09:23,739 --> 01:09:25,324
I'll blow them away!

923
01:09:26,617 --> 01:09:27,826
Shuriken in the fire?!

924
01:09:37,378 --> 01:09:39,338
It seems like you're
proud of your arms...

925
01:09:39,838 --> 01:09:40,548
You!

926
01:09:43,342 --> 01:09:45,427
S-Stop it!

927
01:09:58,774 --> 01:10:00,943
You're the only one left.

928
01:10:02,653 --> 01:10:03,821
You...

929
01:10:03,904 --> 01:10:06,156
At least try to entertain me.

930
01:10:17,459 --> 01:10:18,627
<i>This is not like...</i>

931
01:10:19,670 --> 01:10:21,130
<i>Sasuke!</i>

932
01:10:30,771 --> 01:10:31,772
Stop it.

933
01:10:34,935 --> 01:10:35,978
Please...

934
01:10:38,188 --> 01:10:39,064
Stop.

935
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:49,033
Sasuke!

936
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:51,706
You're strong.

937
01:10:54,705 --> 01:10:59,877
Sasuke... We can't defeat you
while you're like this.

938
01:11:01,945 --> 01:11:03,488
This is a token of our truce...

939
01:11:04,055 --> 01:11:06,266
Please, let us leave.

940
01:11:06,342 --> 01:11:07,051
Huh?

941
01:11:07,718 --> 01:11:13,140
Forgive our selfishness,
but there's something we need to confirm.

942
01:11:15,108 --> 01:11:17,694
That being said, let's make a promise.

943
01:11:18,071 --> 01:11:22,038
If there's another opportunity to
battle with you in this test,

944
01:11:22,702 --> 01:11:25,246
we won't run or hide.

945
01:11:25,987 --> 01:11:26,847
Wait!

946
01:11:28,747 --> 01:11:31,134
Just who in the world is Orochimaru?

947
01:11:31,159 --> 01:11:32,952
What did he do to Sasuke?!

948
01:11:33,118 --> 01:11:34,578
Why Sasuke?!

949
01:11:34,841 --> 01:11:36,008
I don't know...

950
01:11:36,552 --> 01:11:40,848
We were just ordered
to pressure Sasuke.

951
01:11:44,672 --> 01:11:46,523
Hey! Are you okay?!

952
01:11:46,548 --> 01:11:49,176
This is such a drag...
Ino, Lee is all yours.

953
01:11:49,259 --> 01:11:49,927
Got it.

954
01:11:51,136 --> 01:11:53,514
<i>That chakra...
It's abnormal.</i>

955
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:58,185
<i>The Uchiha clan...
so this is their true power, huh?</i>

956
01:11:59,895 --> 01:12:02,314
Sakura's in danger!

957
01:12:02,523 --> 01:12:06,360
It's okay...
I'll protect Sakura.

958
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:09,071
Well, what should we do
with this guy?

959
01:12:09,405 --> 01:12:10,489
Kick him awake?

960
01:12:10,531 --> 01:12:12,324
Can I do it?

961
01:12:14,034 --> 01:12:15,989
What did I...?

962
01:12:27,028 --> 01:12:27,987
<i>That guy...?</i>

963
01:12:28,675 --> 01:12:29,676
Everyone hide!

964
01:12:29,821 --> 01:12:31,489
No, get down quick!

965
01:12:32,225 --> 01:12:34,147
Wh-Where is that guy?

966
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:36,501
Naruto...

967
01:12:37,141 --> 01:12:40,853
<i>That idiot, he finally woke up.</i>

968
01:12:43,147 --> 01:12:45,566
You're really something else.

969
01:12:46,191 --> 01:12:48,777
Actually, you're really starting
to get on my nerves.

970
01:12:55,325 --> 01:12:56,937
Sakura!

971
01:12:57,244 --> 01:12:59,496
- What?
- Your...!

972
01:12:59,872 --> 01:13:02,166
Your hair!

973
01:13:02,482 --> 01:13:04,651
Oh! This?

974
01:13:06,944 --> 01:13:09,798
Just felt like a change... that's it!

975
01:13:12,241 --> 01:13:14,595
I liked it better long but,

976
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:17,547
when I move around in
a forest like this,

977
01:13:17,572 --> 01:13:19,240
it gets in the way if it's long.

978
01:13:22,419 --> 01:13:23,586
By the way...

979
01:13:23,866 --> 01:13:27,161
why are you guys here?!

980
01:13:27,496 --> 01:13:31,834
Hah... It's such a pain
to explain it to you.

981
01:13:33,337 --> 01:13:35,006
I'll take care of him from here.

982
01:13:35,532 --> 01:13:37,451
Ah... Okay...

983
01:13:37,993 --> 01:13:40,579
Keep it together! Lee!

984
01:13:44,458 --> 01:13:48,128
Oh? Tenten, why are you here?

985
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:49,817
I came to help.

986
01:13:50,547 --> 01:13:51,381
Huh?

987
01:13:52,073 --> 01:13:53,950
Where are those Sound Village ninja?

988
01:13:54,234 --> 01:13:56,486
A kid named Sasuke
drove them away!

989
01:13:57,179 --> 01:13:58,138
Really...

990
01:13:58,471 --> 01:14:01,140
Why did you recklessly decide
to act on your own?!

991
01:14:01,517 --> 01:14:03,101
Besides, you really got beaten up!

992
01:14:04,569 --> 01:14:08,865
S-Sakura was in danger.
So as a man, I...

993
01:14:09,210 --> 01:14:11,170
You're really stupid.

994
01:14:11,751 --> 01:14:13,920
I can't argue with that.

995
01:14:14,238 --> 01:14:17,199
You, Bushy Brow!

996
01:14:17,699 --> 01:14:18,826
Naruto!

997
01:14:19,171 --> 01:14:22,842
Don't say rude things to Lee!

998
01:14:26,846 --> 01:14:27,626
Lee...

999
01:14:29,137 --> 01:14:29,930
Thank you.

1000
01:14:30,230 --> 01:14:33,358
Because of you, I feel like
I've finally taken a step forward.

1001
01:14:33,553 --> 01:14:35,763
I feel like I've gotten a little stronger!

1002
01:14:37,594 --> 01:14:38,720
Sakura...

1003
01:14:39,888 --> 01:14:44,268
It looks like my efforts
weren't enough!

1004
01:14:45,269 --> 01:14:46,233
Sasuke...

1005
01:14:47,459 --> 01:14:49,873
Just what you'd expect
from the Uchiha clan.

1006
01:14:49,958 --> 01:14:52,002
I got beaten to a pulp.

1007
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:55,822
<i>What?! He was beaten to a pulp?!</i>

1008
01:14:56,811 --> 01:14:59,397
<i>Were those guys really that strong?</i>

1009
01:15:11,670 --> 01:15:12,838
<i>Special Technique:</i>

1010
01:15:13,544 --> 01:15:15,922
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu: Fishing Version!</i>

1011
01:15:31,096 --> 01:15:32,389
Thrash about more!

1012
01:15:32,483 --> 01:15:33,943
I want to catch some for cooking!

1013
01:15:34,294 --> 01:15:35,545
Three isn't enough!

1014
01:15:37,112 --> 01:15:38,113
Sasuke!

1015
01:15:39,406 --> 01:15:42,034
The firewood is ready!
A fireball, please.

1016
01:15:44,479 --> 01:15:46,147
I guess three will be enough for now.

1017
01:15:46,914 --> 01:15:47,623
What?

1018
01:15:48,874 --> 01:15:51,001
Hey, wait a minute!

1019
01:15:52,294 --> 01:15:55,255
It's already been four days
since the second test started.

1020
01:15:55,916 --> 01:15:56,417
Yeah.

1021
01:15:56,888 --> 01:15:57,694
That's right.

1022
01:15:58,434 --> 01:15:59,602
For all we know...

1023
01:15:59,885 --> 01:16:02,387
there may not be any Heaven scrolls.

1024
01:16:03,221 --> 01:16:04,765
What do you mean, Sakura?

1025
01:16:05,176 --> 01:16:07,178
Well, in this second test...

1026
01:16:07,702 --> 01:16:11,289
four of the five-day
time limit have passed already.

1027
01:16:12,022 --> 01:16:16,273
That means we've already used up
eighty percent of our time.

1028
01:16:16,867 --> 01:16:19,787
Seventy-eight participants
and twenty-six teams.

1029
01:16:20,478 --> 01:16:23,106
There are only thirteen each
of the Heaven and Earth scrolls.

1030
01:16:23,408 --> 01:16:26,495
At most, only 13 teams can pass.

1031
01:16:31,036 --> 01:16:32,882
After parting ways with
the Leaf Village bunch,

1032
01:16:32,907 --> 01:16:35,410
we allotted two days for healing...

1033
01:16:36,463 --> 01:16:39,383
So from here on, we have to cover
more ground.

1034
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:45,646
At any rate,
the next enemy is our last chance.

1035
01:16:47,391 --> 01:16:48,850
I'm going to get some drinking water.

1036
01:17:01,238 --> 01:17:02,906
Say! Say!

1037
01:17:03,740 --> 01:17:06,535
I've got a great idea so we won't have
to fight anyone!

1038
01:17:06,827 --> 01:17:07,619
What?!

1039
01:17:11,999 --> 01:17:15,085
I have lots of blank scrolls stocked up.

1040
01:17:15,752 --> 01:17:18,880
A ninjutsu manual, a deadly poison manual,
and one for notes...

1041
01:17:19,065 --> 01:17:22,359
If we tweak this a little and make it
look exactly like a Heaven scroll...

1042
01:17:22,384 --> 01:17:23,760
H-Hold it!

1043
01:17:23,969 --> 01:17:24,678
Huh?

1044
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:28,328
Even if you do that, you don't know
what's written on the inside!

1045
01:17:28,655 --> 01:17:31,199
If a proctor looks inside,
they'll find out immediately!

1046
01:17:31,518 --> 01:17:32,227
Idiot!

1047
01:17:32,936 --> 01:17:34,521
Generally with things like this,

1048
01:17:34,771 --> 01:17:36,665
there's a password or
something written inside,

1049
01:17:36,690 --> 01:17:39,693
and you can't understand it
unless you have both scrolls.

1050
01:17:40,152 --> 01:17:44,031
If you don't know the contents,
there's no use making a fake!

1051
01:17:44,281 --> 01:17:47,034
What if we could predict the contents...?

1052
01:17:48,618 --> 01:17:49,786
This Earth scroll...

1053
01:17:49,836 --> 01:17:50,837
No!

1054
01:17:51,665 --> 01:17:54,376
You! Have you forgotten
even the rules, you idiot?

1055
01:17:54,757 --> 01:17:58,636
We were told not to look inside
until arriving at the tower, right?

1056
01:17:58,879 --> 01:18:01,827
But at this rate,
we'll be in big trouble, right?

1057
01:18:22,527 --> 01:18:25,405
Damn it... They're all monsters!

1058
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:27,209
How can we steal a scroll

1059
01:18:27,234 --> 01:18:29,862
when defending ours
takes everything we've got?

1060
01:18:30,144 --> 01:18:32,188
But we can't back off!

1061
01:18:32,572 --> 01:18:34,999
The pride of our village
is on the line!

1062
01:18:35,024 --> 01:18:37,197
Then we'll go back to tracking.

1063
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:39,381
And we'll definitely
get it done this time.

1064
01:18:42,495 --> 01:18:43,859
What should I do?

1065
01:18:44,248 --> 01:18:46,000
You'll only be in the way
if you come along.

1066
01:18:46,827 --> 01:18:48,082
Take this and stay hidden.

1067
01:18:48,285 --> 01:18:49,649
Okay.

1068
01:19:02,751 --> 01:19:04,009
Oh yeah.
I have to keep hidden.

1069
01:19:21,378 --> 01:19:22,504
<i>Lions Barrage!</i>

1070
01:19:29,659 --> 01:19:31,578
The Earth Scroll... same as us.

1071
01:19:36,084 --> 01:19:37,627
My glasses!

1072
01:19:48,294 --> 01:19:49,295
See ya.

1073
01:20:19,436 --> 01:20:20,437
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

1074
01:20:25,914 --> 01:20:27,957
Man, you guys are hopeless...

1075
01:20:28,865 --> 01:20:30,158
That was close.

1076
01:20:30,697 --> 01:20:32,490
W-We're sorry.

1077
01:20:34,576 --> 01:20:39,247
Those who ignore the rules
will be disqualified.

1078
01:20:39,873 --> 01:20:43,293
In the previous exam, a hypnotic
genjutsu was placed...

1079
01:20:43,418 --> 01:20:46,504
to affect the eyes of anyone who opened
the scroll before reaching the tower.

1080
01:20:47,518 --> 01:20:51,689
It was a measure to put them to sleep
until the test ended.

1081
01:20:53,970 --> 01:20:55,138
By the way...

1082
01:20:55,263 --> 01:20:57,224
If I'm not mistaken, you're Kabuto, right?

1083
01:20:57,812 --> 01:21:00,314
What are you doing hanging
around here alone?

1084
01:21:00,745 --> 01:21:04,082
It's not that I'm after your scroll.

1085
01:21:04,231 --> 01:21:05,315
I didn't think so.

1086
01:21:05,607 --> 01:21:09,986
If that was your intention...
you could've taken it from Naruto.

1087
01:21:11,279 --> 01:21:14,032
So you're also after the Heaven scroll?

1088
01:21:14,449 --> 01:21:15,200
No.

1089
01:21:15,784 --> 01:21:17,577
I already have them both.

1090
01:21:18,703 --> 01:21:19,287
See?

1091
01:21:19,788 --> 01:21:20,622
<i>What?</i>

1092
01:21:21,456 --> 01:21:22,958
One thing led to another...

1093
01:21:23,183 --> 01:21:25,060
I was hurrying towards the tower

1094
01:21:25,085 --> 01:21:26,795
to wait for my teammates 
after getting separated.

1095
01:21:27,796 --> 01:21:29,756
Now, if you'll excuse me...

1096
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:33,134
Wait!

1097
01:21:36,972 --> 01:21:37,806
Fight me.

1098
01:21:43,645 --> 01:21:44,755
Lucky!

1099
01:21:46,648 --> 01:21:47,607
Fight you, you say?

1100
01:21:48,650 --> 01:21:49,651
S-Sasuke.

1101
01:21:49,734 --> 01:21:50,860
You big idiot!

1102
01:21:50,885 --> 01:21:52,386
What's this all of a sudden?

1103
01:21:53,196 --> 01:21:54,072
Are you serious?

1104
01:21:55,031 --> 01:21:58,827
Sorry, but we don't have any more time.

1105
01:21:59,327 --> 01:22:03,456
Hey, Sasuke! Kabuto saved us!

1106
01:22:03,915 --> 01:22:07,252
Sasuke, I'm not so sure about that myself.

1107
01:22:07,321 --> 01:22:08,114
Shut up!

1108
01:22:08,945 --> 01:22:12,115
It can't be helped.
I said it before, too.

1109
01:22:12,716 --> 01:22:16,219
This is what it takes to survive
in this forest.

1110
01:22:16,553 --> 01:22:19,139
Hmm... That's a lie.

1111
01:22:20,515 --> 01:22:24,269
If you were really serious
about this test...

1112
01:22:24,894 --> 01:22:27,188
Why would it be necessary to fight me?

1113
01:22:28,898 --> 01:22:31,067
You should have attacked me
when my guard was down,

1114
01:22:31,109 --> 01:22:33,862
instead of announcing your intentions.

1115
01:22:34,605 --> 01:22:37,233
That's... a ninja.

1116
01:22:39,284 --> 01:22:42,829
So, I'll show you the path you should take.

1117
01:22:43,955 --> 01:22:47,000
However... let's talk as we move.

1118
01:22:47,459 --> 01:22:51,338
The smell of fish cooking on the fire
has traveled a long way.

1119
01:22:51,731 --> 01:22:54,859
At this rate, we'll attract
fierce animals... and enemies.

1120
01:23:01,681 --> 01:23:02,682
<i>Humph!</i>

1121
01:23:05,352 --> 01:23:07,312
Are there really still enemies around?

1122
01:23:07,687 --> 01:23:09,397
Yes, no mistake.

1123
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:11,404
If you think about it a little,
you'll understand.

1124
01:23:13,064 --> 01:23:16,151
Do you know the smartest way
to approach battles...

1125
01:23:16,542 --> 01:23:19,086
in a vast forest like this one?

1126
01:23:19,376 --> 01:23:20,168
No.

1127
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:22,827
The tower in the center of this forest,

1128
01:23:22,991 --> 01:23:25,076
is the common goal for all participants.

1129
01:23:25,418 --> 01:23:27,837
That means on the final day
of the test...

1130
01:23:27,974 --> 01:23:33,104
the area near the tower is
the best place to gather scrolls.

1131
01:23:33,788 --> 01:23:36,249
Oh, I see.
Ambush, right?

1132
01:23:36,549 --> 01:23:38,885
In other words, we go after the scrolls
of the teams

1133
01:23:38,910 --> 01:23:42,872
that have both the Heaven and Earth scrolls
and are heading for the tower.

1134
01:23:43,431 --> 01:23:44,349
I see.

1135
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:48,353
I understand the reason
why you appeared before us.

1136
01:23:49,646 --> 01:23:51,606
You're scared, too, right?

1137
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:53,779
That's right.

1138
01:24:01,557 --> 01:24:06,103
It's becoming a real disaster,
but we can't cancel this test.

1139
01:24:06,785 --> 01:24:07,992
What do you mean?

1140
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:09,374
Excuse me!

1141
01:24:10,083 --> 01:24:12,961
What is it?!
We're in the middle of something important!

1142
01:24:13,646 --> 01:24:14,624
Excuse me.

1143
01:24:14,951 --> 01:24:15,855
But... Uh...

1144
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:16,881
Please take a look at this!

1145
01:24:17,580 --> 01:24:18,664
The video?

1146
01:24:22,345 --> 01:24:25,974
Ready? Here! Look at the time!

1147
01:24:34,442 --> 01:24:35,360
T-This is...

1148
01:24:36,042 --> 01:24:37,627
It's a recording inside the tower,

1149
01:24:37,838 --> 01:24:42,509
one hour and thirty-seven minutes
after the start of the second test!

1150
01:24:43,878 --> 01:24:47,798
Three ninja from the Hidden Sand Village
have broken the record.

1151
01:24:51,541 --> 01:24:52,917
This can't be!

1152
01:24:53,513 --> 01:24:55,515
In a mere ninety-seven minutes...

1153
01:24:56,754 --> 01:24:58,631
This has never happened!

1154
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:01,215
This is unusual.

1155
01:25:01,843 --> 01:25:03,887
Those kids aren't Genin level.

1156
01:25:04,554 --> 01:25:08,349
They've rewritten the
fastest time by four hours...

1157
01:25:10,116 --> 01:25:11,451
It's not just that.

1158
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:13,875
What do you mean?

1159
01:25:14,643 --> 01:25:18,063
It's 10 kilometers
from the test entrances to the tower.

1160
01:25:18,683 --> 01:25:22,144
Ferocious animals, poisonous insects,
the rugged forest road...

1161
01:25:22,572 --> 01:25:25,617
as if none of those things were there...

1162
01:25:26,951 --> 01:25:29,120
Especially the redhead in the lead...

1163
01:25:30,087 --> 01:25:31,456
What about him?

1164
01:25:31,873 --> 01:25:32,957
You don't notice?

1165
01:25:38,963 --> 01:25:41,758
I see. This is quite a surprise.

1166
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:45,762
What about him is so impressive?

1167
01:25:46,554 --> 01:25:48,890
Look closely at his body.

1168
01:25:55,146 --> 01:25:56,814
He doesn't have a single scratch.

1169
01:25:57,190 --> 01:26:01,277
What's more, there isn't even
a smudge of dirt on his clothing.

1170
01:26:02,164 --> 01:26:03,624
Even I...

1171
01:26:03,738 --> 01:26:06,658
No, any of the other Chunin...

1172
01:26:07,075 --> 01:26:10,203
It's impossible even for us to
make it to this tower without a scratch.

1173
01:26:10,932 --> 01:26:14,102
It's likely that it has something
to do with his ability.

1174
01:26:14,832 --> 01:26:17,669
It's been a long time since such
a promising candidate has appeared.

1175
01:26:19,208 --> 01:26:22,128
Now then, the tower has finally
come into view.

1176
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:24,116
From here on out, it gets tough.

1177
01:26:24,175 --> 01:26:24,842
There!

1178
01:26:29,847 --> 01:26:32,141
Oh, it's just a centipede.

1179
01:26:32,308 --> 01:26:34,018
Yikes! It's huge.

1180
01:26:34,144 --> 01:26:36,187
All those legs are so gross!

1181
01:26:37,647 --> 01:26:38,648
Naruto.

1182
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:39,649
Huh?

1183
01:26:40,316 --> 01:26:43,736
As long as time allows, we should
go slowly while remaining hidden.

1184
01:26:44,090 --> 01:26:45,697
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1185
01:26:45,863 --> 01:26:46,489
Sure.

1186
01:26:52,579 --> 01:26:54,205
I've... had it...

1187
01:26:54,956 --> 01:26:56,249
Oh, Sakura!

1188
01:26:57,584 --> 01:26:59,377
For crying out loud,
how far have we walked?

1189
01:26:59,961 --> 01:27:02,297
The tower hasn't gotten any closer.

1190
01:27:03,673 --> 01:27:05,842
And yet, we can see it
right in front of us.

1191
01:27:06,092 --> 01:27:07,343
Strange...

1192
01:27:08,094 --> 01:27:09,095
<i>No mistake about it.</i>

1193
01:27:09,377 --> 01:27:14,006
It seems that we've walked right
into their little "welcoming party."

1194
01:27:14,516 --> 01:27:16,644
Take a look at that.

1195
01:27:17,435 --> 01:27:18,062
Huh?

1196
01:27:18,704 --> 01:27:20,747
Oh, that can't be!

1197
01:27:23,149 --> 01:27:24,150
Is it genjutsu...?

1198
01:27:24,694 --> 01:27:28,281
So it seems.
We were lured in perfectly.

1199
01:27:29,148 --> 01:27:31,817
Even though we were being so careful,

1200
01:27:32,418 --> 01:27:34,920
they've had us walking in circles
in the same area.

1201
01:27:36,289 --> 01:27:37,665
We're being watched...

1202
01:27:38,398 --> 01:27:39,399
Probably.

1203
01:27:39,768 --> 01:27:41,811
They intend to wear down
our physical strength

1204
01:27:41,836 --> 01:27:44,047
and strike when we're exhausted
and our guard is down.

1205
01:27:44,733 --> 01:27:47,194
If so, then this is all part
of the enemy's strategy.

1206
01:27:47,759 --> 01:27:50,678
Then... They'll be coming soon.

1207
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:12,390
They're here.

1208
01:28:13,060 --> 01:28:15,145
The perfect number for a handicap.

1209
01:28:15,957 --> 01:28:17,292
There's quite a few.

1210
01:28:17,832 --> 01:28:19,334
And... they're clones.

1211
01:28:22,126 --> 01:28:23,795
You're like rats in a trap.

1212
01:28:25,213 --> 01:28:25,922
Shut up!

1213
01:28:32,641 --> 01:28:33,809
<i>I'll see through them!</i>

1214
01:28:34,418 --> 01:28:35,419
<i>Sharingan!</i>

1215
01:28:36,397 --> 01:28:37,398
Naruto!

1216
01:28:46,107 --> 01:28:47,108
Watch out!

1217
01:28:48,236 --> 01:28:49,237
What are you doing?!

1218
01:28:54,415 --> 01:28:55,416
Damn it!

1219
01:28:56,702 --> 01:28:57,495
It's useless!

1220
01:28:57,682 --> 01:28:59,517
Forget it! They're illusions!

1221
01:29:00,938 --> 01:29:02,231
A genjutsu created by the enemy!

1222
01:29:02,614 --> 01:29:04,991
But Kabuto's wound is real.

1223
01:29:05,532 --> 01:29:07,868
No, Sasuke is right.

1224
01:29:08,886 --> 01:29:12,006
No doubt, the enemy is
hiding somewhere

1225
01:29:12,031 --> 01:29:14,617
and attacking from
a different location

1226
01:29:14,642 --> 01:29:16,519
to coordinate with the attack
of their genjutsu user.

1227
01:29:17,465 --> 01:29:19,217
And they're making us think that

1228
01:29:19,242 --> 01:29:21,578
these genjutsu shinobi are
the ones who are attacking.

1229
01:29:22,443 --> 01:29:25,071
Okay then, if we destroy all
these illusions at once,

1230
01:29:25,096 --> 01:29:26,347
things will go back to normal.

1231
01:29:26,899 --> 01:29:30,903
And the enemy won't be able
to throw their kunai.

1232
01:29:31,353 --> 01:29:33,397
We'll find out
where they're hiding.

1233
01:29:34,247 --> 01:29:35,665
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

1234
01:29:39,315 --> 01:29:40,316
Shadow Clones!

1235
01:29:42,749 --> 01:29:44,292
Damn it!

1236
01:29:54,385 --> 01:29:55,845
Damn it!

1237
01:30:13,308 --> 01:30:16,227
We've worn them down.

1238
01:30:16,779 --> 01:30:19,949
All that's left are their real bodies.

1239
01:30:20,253 --> 01:30:21,588
Lucky!

1240
01:30:24,531 --> 01:30:27,630
You really did a number on me.

1241
01:30:28,594 --> 01:30:31,346
You're the one who got
my left shoulder, right?

1242
01:30:32,749 --> 01:30:34,001
It's time for payback!

1243
01:30:37,595 --> 01:30:39,096
You're trapped like rats.

1244
01:30:40,596 --> 01:30:42,306
It worked, Naruto.

1245
01:30:45,122 --> 01:30:47,458
Impossible! When did you...

1246
01:30:48,651 --> 01:30:52,864
Stupid! You jerks finally show yourselves!

1247
01:30:55,829 --> 01:30:57,915
<i>This kid... no way.</i>

1248
01:30:58,598 --> 01:31:01,684
Looks like you genjutsu users just got
a taste of your own medicine!

1249
01:31:02,235 --> 01:31:03,778
Now, it's our...

1250
01:31:07,849 --> 01:31:10,810
Naruto, you used up
too much chakra!

1251
01:31:11,260 --> 01:31:12,470
I'll take care of the rest!

1252
01:31:17,747 --> 01:31:20,317
As if! I'm not going to let you take over

1253
01:31:20,342 --> 01:31:21,719
and show off.

1254
01:31:23,382 --> 01:31:26,385
<i>Is this really the Naruto I know?</i>

1255
01:31:27,713 --> 01:31:29,339
<i>What is with this amount
of chakra?</i>

1256
01:31:29,881 --> 01:31:31,716
<i>Right after his Multi-Shadow
Clone jutsu,</i>

1257
01:31:31,741 --> 01:31:34,160
<i>he could still transform three of them
into perfect copies of us.</i>

1258
01:31:35,028 --> 01:31:36,128
<i>All that...</i>

1259
01:31:36,599 --> 01:31:37,892
<i>And he can still move.</i>

1260
01:31:39,917 --> 01:31:41,878
<i>This is the fifth day.</i>

1261
01:31:46,081 --> 01:31:47,761
Great job Naruto!

1262
01:31:55,530 --> 01:31:58,241
What happened there? Are you hurt?

1263
01:31:58,801 --> 01:31:59,969
That's a terrible mark.

1264
01:32:02,162 --> 01:32:03,413
It's nothing.

1265
01:32:07,035 --> 01:32:09,829
Here it is, here it is!

1266
01:32:10,143 --> 01:32:12,646
Look, the Heaven scroll!

1267
01:32:12,831 --> 01:32:13,957
Good for you.

1268
01:32:16,527 --> 01:32:20,448
<i>There's something about this guy...
that I don't like.</i>

1269
01:32:27,455 --> 01:32:29,790
Oh, it's you guys.

1270
01:32:30,458 --> 01:32:31,959
You're late, Kabuto.

1271
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:34,503
I got a bit involved in something.

1272
01:32:35,215 --> 01:32:36,007
Sorry.

1273
01:32:36,071 --> 01:32:41,034
But hey, thanks to you,
we got both scrolls!

1274
01:32:41,431 --> 01:32:44,351
No, it's because you guys fought hard.

1275
01:32:44,937 --> 01:32:47,147
We're going through this door.

1276
01:32:48,347 --> 01:32:50,266
Well then, I wish us both luck.

1277
01:32:50,686 --> 01:32:51,479
Yeah!

1278
01:32:51,729 --> 01:32:52,605
Yeah!

1279
01:33:03,074 --> 01:33:04,456
How was the "harvest"?

1280
01:33:04,481 --> 01:33:05,509
Right...

1281
01:33:05,534 --> 01:33:06,911
More than I expected.

1282
01:33:07,495 --> 01:33:12,124
I've collected all his data
from this second test.

1283
01:33:12,959 --> 01:33:14,543
You need this, right?

1284
01:33:15,586 --> 01:33:18,464
So, how was it?

1285
01:33:20,049 --> 01:33:21,801
As I thought, it appears you're curious.

1286
01:33:22,134 --> 01:33:23,552
Lord Orochimaru.

1287
01:33:24,285 --> 01:33:26,412
I want to ask your opinion.

1288
01:33:27,264 --> 01:33:29,684
As a Sound Village spy...

1289
01:33:30,093 --> 01:33:31,929
That's not necessary, is it?

1290
01:33:32,879 --> 01:33:36,970
You will be the one to decide all that...

1291
01:33:38,985 --> 01:33:43,489
I like that cleverness of yours.

1292
01:33:44,365 --> 01:33:46,200
There's nobody here.

1293
01:33:47,702 --> 01:33:49,537
I'm okay now, Sakura.

1294
01:33:50,079 --> 01:33:51,163
O-Okay.

1295
01:33:52,039 --> 01:33:53,833
<i>That's too bad!</i>

1296
01:33:54,166 --> 01:33:55,626
<i>Cha!</i>

1297
01:33:55,793 --> 01:33:59,422
Say, say, what are we supposed to do?

1298
01:33:59,630 --> 01:34:01,424
Oh! Look at that...

1299
01:34:01,924 --> 01:34:07,179
"Heaven"... "Earth"...
I don't get this at all.

1300
01:34:07,396 --> 01:34:09,873
"If you lack Heaven, gain knowledge
and await your opportunity."

1301
01:34:10,224 --> 01:34:12,852
"If you lack Earth, run across the
land to gain your advantage."

1302
01:34:13,227 --> 01:34:14,895
"When Heaven and Earth align,"

1303
01:34:15,061 --> 01:34:16,896
"the perilous path shall be overcome..."

1304
01:34:17,106 --> 01:34:21,569
"This is the secret
that guides one to the path..."

1305
01:34:22,403 --> 01:34:23,446
What's that?

1306
01:34:24,967 --> 01:34:28,398
It looks like there's a character missing.

1307
01:34:28,995 --> 01:34:31,248
It probably has something to do with the scroll

1308
01:34:31,897 --> 01:34:36,193
I think this means we're supposed to open
the Heaven and Earth scrolls at the same time.

1309
01:34:56,103 --> 01:34:58,647
All right then, I'm opening them!
