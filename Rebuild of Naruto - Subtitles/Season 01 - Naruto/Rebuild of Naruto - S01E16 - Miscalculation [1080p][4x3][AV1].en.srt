1
00:00:08,115 --> 00:00:11,546
Oh... guys... How have you been?

2
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,245
Kid, where are you going?

3
00:00:36,095 --> 00:00:39,803
If you value your life, go no further.

4
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:42,751
A demon lives there.

5
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:44,386
A demon?

6
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:47,756
He's known as Jugo the Unstable.

7
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:49,632
Look at that.

8
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,421
Because of Jugo,
no one lives in that village, to this day.

9
00:00:55,745 --> 00:00:59,165
No one's ever gotten close to him
and come back alive.

10
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,606
I don't mean to lecture you,
but you should go back.

11
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:16,326
What? You've followed me?

12
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:20,413
But stop where you are.
Don't come any closer.

13
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:23,700
Now, go back home.

14
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:43,348
Don't come near me! Go away!

15
00:01:43,741 --> 00:01:45,118
Come any closer and I'll kill you!

16
00:01:45,384 --> 00:01:48,053
I'll kill anyone who comes in here!

17
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,310
Who is it?

18
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,729
Go away!

19
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:34,797
Go away! I said to go away!

20
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,120
I'll kill you...

21
00:02:44,621 --> 00:02:47,459
I'll kill you too!

22
00:02:59,843 --> 00:03:02,512
I see... Your strength is amazing...

23
00:03:03,177 --> 00:03:05,012
I thought I was a goner.

24
00:03:05,207 --> 00:03:07,793
Wh-Who are you...?

25
00:03:08,612 --> 00:03:11,948
Kimimaro... I came for you.

26
00:03:12,481 --> 00:03:15,942
Would you like to come to
Lord Orochimaru's side with me?

27
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:17,818
Orochimaru...?

28
00:03:18,704 --> 00:03:20,949
There are many people at
Lord Orochimaru's side

29
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,635
who are just like you and me...

30
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:25,585
You're all alone, aren't you?

31
00:03:26,071 --> 00:03:30,117
If you go to Lord Orochimaru,
you won't be alone anymore.

32
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:35,046
I'm not normal.
I can't control myself.

33
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,582
There's no telling when I'll start killing
the people around me.

34
00:03:38,944 --> 00:03:40,529
I won't get killed.

35
00:03:41,132 --> 00:03:42,842
I'm not that weak.

36
00:03:43,417 --> 00:03:46,128
Aren't you... afraid of me?

37
00:03:46,705 --> 00:03:48,916
No, I'm not, Jugo.

38
00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:54,263
I will become your cage...

39
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:11,287
As long as I am by your side...
I will be the one to keep you in check.

40
00:04:16,002 --> 00:04:18,171
Huh? Is that... true?

41
00:04:18,515 --> 00:04:23,520
Yes. I'm going to absorb the enzyme
from your body into my own.

42
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:27,495
Just like you,
I will possess the power of the Curse Mark.

43
00:04:27,952 --> 00:04:29,120
Hold on a minute.

44
00:04:29,342 --> 00:04:31,886
The Curse Mark doesn't adapt
to just anyone.

45
00:04:32,677 --> 00:04:34,471
If it doesn't adapt...

46
00:04:34,737 --> 00:04:38,574
I know... At that moment, I'll die.

47
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:41,071
If you know, then stop this!

48
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,205
This is a form of treatment for me.

49
00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:46,834
My body is being eaten away
by disease.

50
00:04:47,296 --> 00:04:51,300
Perhaps your Curse Mark
will slow its progress.

51
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:54,670
Your power will save me.

52
00:04:56,476 --> 00:04:58,145
Don't worry so much.

53
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,333
It's all right. We're friends.

54
00:05:02,805 --> 00:05:05,564
There's no way your power
will reject me.

55
00:05:18,838 --> 00:05:19,672
Just as I thought...

56
00:05:20,496 --> 00:05:22,790
I wasn't chosen this time, either.

57
00:05:23,992 --> 00:05:26,397
Kabuto-sensei, I...

58
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,120
Take care of your body.

59
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:31,933
Your role is now finished.

60
00:05:33,441 --> 00:05:36,611
From now on,
it's the Sound Four, Kimimaro...

61
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:46,164
I... still haven't...

62
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:50,099
Your replacement has
already been found.

63
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:57,148
He possesses power equal
to your Earth Curse Mark!

64
00:05:57,753 --> 00:05:59,922
He has been given
the Heaven Curse Mark!

65
00:06:00,357 --> 00:06:03,193
Additionally, he even
has a Kekkei Genkai.

66
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,499
Wonder who's stronger...

67
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,815
What's the matter?
Don't get too excited.

68
00:06:38,258 --> 00:06:39,592
Kabuto-sensei...

69
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:47,686
How much... time do I have left?

70
00:06:51,874 --> 00:06:54,001
You shouldn't talk anymore...

71
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:01,018
P-People...
are born for a reason...

72
00:07:02,703 --> 00:07:04,371
Since people are born,

73
00:07:04,734 --> 00:07:07,278
there must be some kind
of important calling

74
00:07:08,207 --> 00:07:10,501
Recently, I've started to think that...

75
00:07:25,283 --> 00:07:27,285
That the meaning for being born...

76
00:07:28,684 --> 00:07:32,312
For people, finding that meaning is...

77
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,092
the only true freedom given to us.

78
00:07:41,851 --> 00:07:43,770
I understand what you want to say.

79
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:47,467
Indeed, Lord Orochimaru
is now suffering.

80
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,304
It's an unprecedented crisis,

81
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,890
but I will be blunt.

82
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,225
What can you do now?

83
00:07:56,967 --> 00:07:59,720
You've now lost your value
as a vessel.

84
00:08:02,394 --> 00:08:05,272
A new vessel is heading this way.

85
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,195
Well...

86
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,822
At this point, it's too late, but...

87
00:08:10,706 --> 00:08:11,498
Indeed...

88
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:16,537
My body is no longer a worthy vessel
for his Reincarnation.

89
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:21,836
It will be difficult for someone like me,
who has lost everything...

90
00:08:21,861 --> 00:08:24,697
to find my own purpose.

91
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,674
I've finally understood that...

92
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,721
Even if it's not me,

93
00:08:34,028 --> 00:08:39,367
I'll bring in the new vessel
even if it costs me my life.

94
00:08:40,107 --> 00:08:43,599
This is how I will repay my debt
to Lord Orochimaru.

95
00:08:45,084 --> 00:08:49,964
That's the only way for someone
as worthless as me to find redemption...

96
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,359
We're close!

97
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,694
There are two enemies left...

98
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,198
There are three of us...
It's three against two.

99
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:01,535
If we play this right, one more
engagement should do it.

100
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,205
All right! All right!
Let's do it!

101
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,749
No! It's four against two!

102
00:11:08,642 --> 00:11:11,337
Okay, okay! I'm sorry.

103
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,714
Counting Akamaru,
it's four against two!

104
00:11:14,414 --> 00:11:18,069
Let's end this quick with
our new technique!

105
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:23,265
Hey, hey! If we have to,
I'll bust out my awesome Shadow Clones,

106
00:11:23,431 --> 00:11:24,849
so we'll be fine!

107
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,103
That's reassuring...

108
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:32,441
But my strategy comes first. Got it?

109
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,860
Y-Yeah...

110
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:36,862
For that purpose,

111
00:11:37,037 --> 00:11:39,665
We have to catch up before the sun sets.

112
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,457
I know. Let's go full speed!

113
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,257
The sun's starting to set...

114
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,926
Neither Jirobo nor Kidomaru
have returned.

115
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,512
It seems they're having
a hard time.

116
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,766
It doesn't matter...
Lord Orochimaru is more important.

117
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:14,275
We've only completed one third
of the journey in half a day...

118
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,235
Yeah, this is bad...

119
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,321
We don't know whether
we'll make it in time at this rate!

120
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,287
Lord Orochimaru...

121
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:11,874
Sasuke...

122
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,210
Sasuke's not... here yet?

123
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,507
<i>He's running out of time...
He can't go on any longer.</i>

124
00:13:20,447 --> 00:13:21,406
Lord Orochimaru...

125
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,345
Several bodies have been
prepared for you!

126
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:28,682
And... you could even use me,
if necessary...

127
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,145
It has to be Sasuke...

128
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,191
How long do you think I've waited?

129
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:38,984
It's a matter of urgency!

130
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,737
The Third Hokage's jutsu...

131
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,572
His curse was stronger
than expected!

132
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:50,037
If you don't reincarnate right now,
you'll lose everything!

133
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,039
Is that what you want?!

134
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:59,046
I've selected and prepared
suitable bodies for you.

135
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:02,049
Please leave it to me! Also...

136
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,052
I'll handle bringing Sasuke
here as well.

137
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,519
<i>Curse you...</i>

138
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,855
<i>Third Hokage!</i>

139
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,282
<i>Release!</i>

140
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,174
Listen well, everyone!

141
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,970
I shall release you from this prison...

142
00:14:52,688 --> 00:14:54,523
However, I will only release one of you!

143
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,712
<i>Okay! You said you were going
to let one person out of here.</i>

144
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,633
<i>You're going to keep
your promise.</i>

145
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,180
<i>What are you doing?
Open the door now!</i>

146
00:15:35,736 --> 00:15:38,681
What? There was another one?

147
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:39,980
Hurry up and...

148
00:16:10,653 --> 00:16:14,907
<i>No... I'm... I'm going to be eaten...</i>

149
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,893
I'll let you out of here...

150
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:22,189
And I shall grant you
just one wish.

151
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:32,282
My clan... They were captured
for your experiments.

152
00:16:32,505 --> 00:16:33,756
Please release them.

153
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:39,265
Sure. Consider it done.

154
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,156
You don't have to worry.

155
00:16:43,181 --> 00:16:48,311
Your strong will shall live on
as a part of me.

156
00:16:49,295 --> 00:16:52,215
It's not like you'll lose everything.

157
00:16:55,859 --> 00:16:59,358
Now then, your flesh is mine...

158
00:17:06,729 --> 00:17:09,034
<i>With this, Lord Orochimaru has
taken a new vessel.</i>

159
00:17:09,474 --> 00:17:11,893
<i>He won't be able to reincarnate
again for several years.</i>

160
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,491
<i>However, there is the next time.</i>

161
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:25,544
Hold on a minute!

162
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,422
Are we almost there?

163
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,716
No... It should still take a while.

164
00:17:31,249 --> 00:17:32,292
More importantly...

165
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:40,476
What are those idiots,
Jirobo and Kidomaru, doing?!

166
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,854
We caught up!

167
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,024
All right! I'll take care of
this nice and quick!

168
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:47,858
R-Right away?!

169
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,031
Eat this!

170
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:56,909
<i>Multiple Fist Barrage!</i>

171
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,416
<i>Chakra in his palm...?!</i>

172
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,670
<i>A transformed Shadow Clone?</i>

173
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,089
<i>Rasengan!</i>

174
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,550
<i>N-No way... His hands just now...?!</i>

175
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:17,387
Pointless if I get you before you can even move!

176
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:18,305
<i>Fang Over Fang!</i>

177
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,648
<i>They lined Sakon up with me...</i>

178
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,133
<i>So I was their target from the beginning?!</i>

179
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,027
You think you succeeded
just with that?!

180
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,170
<i>Damn!</i>

181
00:18:37,629 --> 00:18:38,630
I've been caught!

182
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,161
Shadow Possession Jutsu succeeded!

183
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,454
<i>A diversion...</i>

184
00:18:43,897 --> 00:18:44,505
<i>He's coming!</i>

185
00:18:47,075 --> 00:18:49,411
Tayuya! What are you doing
just standing there?!

186
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:50,796
N-No!

187
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,133
Why do you move forward?!

188
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:56,718
<i>I can't dodge!</i>

189
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,474
Here you go!

190
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:06,145
Nice! Kiba, Shikamaru!

191
00:19:06,501 --> 00:19:08,628
Shikamaru! Let's get out of here!

192
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:10,816
Yeah!

193
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,613
I won't let you get away!

194
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,501
They're fast.

195
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,217
Akamaru.

196
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,720
Hurry back after you've set the bombs!

197
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,267
Messing with me.

198
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:47,853
Akamaru.

199
00:19:48,406 --> 00:19:50,597
Don't you bark at me, you mutt!

200
00:19:58,081 --> 00:19:58,915
Hold on.

201
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,866
You!

202
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,636
Kiba! Akamaru!

203
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,542
Damn it.

204
00:20:27,046 --> 00:20:28,600
You punks!

205
00:20:30,818 --> 00:20:31,944
We have no choice.

206
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:36,568
I'll take care of this, so you take
the coffin and go on ahead.

207
00:20:36,884 --> 00:20:37,635
Shikamaru...

208
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:38,695
Get going already.

209
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:48,121
Wh-Why are you...?

210
00:21:05,552 --> 00:21:09,620
I'm sorry, Naruto.
I miscalculated.

211
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:12,608
Kimimaro.

212
00:21:16,953 --> 00:21:19,545
You were taking too long, Tayuya.

213
00:21:23,051 --> 00:21:26,346
And what happened to the other three?

214
00:21:27,697 --> 00:21:30,283
And you call yourselves the Sound Five.

215
00:21:32,598 --> 00:21:34,410
You persistent bastard...

216
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,240
I'm starting to understand
that feeling a little...

217
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:43,844
of the soul escaping
the prison of the flesh.

218
00:21:50,445 --> 00:21:54,268
The feeling of experiencing
a taste of Lord Orochimaru's dream.

219
00:21:55,802 --> 00:21:57,178
Orochimaru...!

220
00:21:58,215 --> 00:22:01,843
This vessel... is an important vessel
for his dream...

221
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:06,199
The flesh that Lord Orochimaru
truly desires.

222
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:09,494
But you guys were a bit too late.

223
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,877
<i>Some dangerous guy
has appeared again.</i>

224
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,963
<i>That air about him is
nothing ordinary.</i>

225
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:24,217
<i>Anyway, we need
to sort out the situation.</i>

226
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:25,946
<i>If we were to carelessly
plunge in...</i>

227
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:30,476
You jerk!
What's all this nonsense you're spouting?!

228
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:31,320
Naruto!

229
00:22:31,345 --> 00:22:33,031
Give back Sasuke!

230
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,221
Hey, wait!

231
00:22:43,627 --> 00:22:45,958
The reason why I won't kill you now

232
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:50,516
is because you have a mission
you have to complete.

233
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:57,876
And my mission is to deliver
that to Lord Orochimaru.

234
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,337
Isn't it too late now?

235
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,673
Humph. I told you.

236
00:23:03,995 --> 00:23:07,857
That's the body that Lord Orochimaru
truly desires.

237
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,514
The next vessel, huh?

238
00:23:12,327 --> 00:23:13,703
That's right...

239
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:17,979
And this is the only thing that
I can do at present.

240
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:22,793
I'll leave the trash to you.

241
00:23:29,212 --> 00:23:30,463
Sasuke...

242
00:23:31,094 --> 00:23:32,721
That punk!

243
00:23:32,746 --> 00:23:34,161
Calm down, Naruto.

244
00:23:34,186 --> 00:23:35,657
How can I calm down?

245
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:38,834
At this rate,
Sasuke will get even farther away.

246
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,381
<i>Naruto's right.</i>

247
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,551
<i>This is a mission to bring Sasuke back
to the Leaf Village.</i>

248
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:51,555
<i>We must choose what would be
the most rational means</i>

249
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,956
<i>to execute the mission.</i>

250
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:56,935
Damned punks.

251
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,603
I'll finish this in a flash.

252
00:23:59,047 --> 00:24:00,219
Naruto, listen up.

253
00:24:01,452 --> 00:24:04,444
Please follow the plan
I'm about to explain.

254
00:24:06,544 --> 00:24:09,297
<i>He's a typical
close-range combat idiot</i>

255
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,575
<i>with Shadow Clones
as his only saving grace.</i>

256
00:24:12,397 --> 00:24:14,344
<i>And he's a mid-range
combat type</i>

257
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:17,717
<i>who binds his enemies with
a jutsu using shadows...</i>

258
00:24:18,107 --> 00:24:20,329
<i>and a sharp-witted squad leader, huh?</i>

259
00:24:24,427 --> 00:24:25,553
Got it?

260
00:24:25,611 --> 00:24:26,339
Yeah.

261
00:24:27,876 --> 00:24:29,712
Come on already, you punks.

262
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,181
It's two versus one.
We've got the upper hand.

263
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,683
It's an opponent we can beat
if we team up.

264
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:38,002
Let's go, Naruto.

265
00:24:38,051 --> 00:24:39,129
All right.

266
00:24:40,204 --> 00:24:41,934
For jerks like you,

267
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:44,161
it doesn't matter how many
of you there are.

268
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,918
Don't underestimate our teamwork.

269
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:48,028
Let's go!

270
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,617
Bring it.

271
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:55,994
Now... Naruto.

272
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,705
I'll blow you away.

273
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,839
Farewell.

274
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:09,674
Blast.

275
00:25:09,937 --> 00:25:11,313
You tricked me.

276
00:25:11,338 --> 00:25:14,674
Teamwork? Don't make me laugh,
you little punks...

277
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:21,561
Blast.

278
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:28,944
You wouldn't fall for the same trick
over and over, huh?

279
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:32,471
Small fry... You've got nerve.

280
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:37,619
Well, I guess I'll settle for just
having been able to let him get away.

281
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:39,517
Remember this.

282
00:25:40,077 --> 00:25:42,320
It's not just jutsu that are weapons.

283
00:25:46,493 --> 00:25:48,309
<i>I'm counting on you, Shikamaru.</i>

284
00:26:00,249 --> 00:26:03,815
<i>That Tayuya... if she ever comes back,
I'll kill her.</i>

285
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,023
Hold it.

286
00:26:08,591 --> 00:26:09,415
Hey!

287
00:26:09,989 --> 00:26:12,825
Now then, how shall I defeat you?

288
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:20,955
You...

289
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,053
<i>Those eyes...</i>

290
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:28,086
<i>It seems he possesses
a peculiar chakra.</i>

291
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:34,467
What does Orochimaru want to do...?
Why's he after Sasuke?

292
00:26:39,352 --> 00:26:43,148
Lord Orochimaru has already
obtained an Immortality Jutsu...

293
00:26:43,801 --> 00:26:49,724
It takes a long time to master every
jutsu and obtain everything in the world.

294
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:53,278
What does that have to do
with Sasuke?!

295
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:58,717
Being Immortal doesn't mean
the body lasts forever...

296
00:26:59,765 --> 00:27:01,782
Before his body decays,

297
00:27:02,173 --> 00:27:05,968
a strong and new body is needed
as a vessel for his soul.

298
00:27:06,964 --> 00:27:08,007
That's...

299
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,892
Are you saying that's Sasuke?!

300
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:15,216
Yes... That's right.

301
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:20,180
I won't let such a thing happen!

302
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:26,432
Idiot... What good will it do
sending one little punk after him?

303
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:30,148
And looking at things
in terms of time,

304
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:34,057
up until now you probably sacrificed
one member each time

305
00:27:34,082 --> 00:27:36,438
in order for the group
to move forward.

306
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:43,411
Is that guy Sasuke
really that important?

307
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:48,792
How many of your men do you intend
to sacrifice for just one person?

308
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,568
You useless punk.

309
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:57,240
Heh... Indeed...

310
00:27:58,476 --> 00:28:02,897
For me, this is my first mission
as a squad leader.

311
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,206
I couldn't help but feel anxious
as my comrades were picked off one by one.

312
00:28:08,011 --> 00:28:12,224
I didn't know if my own judgment
was truly the right one.

313
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:18,697
As a squad leader entrusted with
the lives of his team

314
00:28:19,128 --> 00:28:21,839
the by-the-book move would be
to prioritize...

315
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:25,596
the lives of the whole squad
over the one captured by the enemy,

316
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:30,418
and decide to abort a mission
that's too dangerous.

317
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:33,245
Then, why didn't you do that?

318
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:38,333
Things rarely go by the book...

319
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:44,889
Since not one person in my squad
would do something like

320
00:28:45,106 --> 00:28:52,723
abandoning a comrade
just to save their own skin.

321
00:28:54,417 --> 00:28:55,879
Me included.

322
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:03,074
I'm just a guy who likes to watch the clouds...

323
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:06,786
I am not cut out to be a squad leader
who orders comrades around.

324
00:29:08,439 --> 00:29:15,655
The only thing I can do for them...
is to have faith in them.

325
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:20,133
Listen. I'm not thinking that
they were sacrifices.

326
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:23,370
I'm not thinking that they've died.

327
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:28,433
Don't mock my comrades.

328
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,727
Yahoo!

329
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,187
<i>Got you!</i>

330
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:41,988
Damn!

331
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:44,824
Listen, Akamaru.

332
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:48,845
We're going to attack from both sides
with Fang Over Fang.

333
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,274
Here we go!

334
00:29:58,797 --> 00:29:59,814
<i>Fang Over Fang!</i>

335
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,438
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

336
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,522
This doesn't look so good.

337
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,943
I'll play a melody of death for you.

338
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,905
What's with this guy?

339
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:27,090
<i>What?!</i>

340
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:33,498
Two on two is perfect,
right, Sakon?

341
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,343
I will never let you take Sasuke!

342
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:49,097
There's a lot of trash scattered about.

343
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:54,269
But after all, trash is trash.

344
00:30:55,097 --> 00:30:57,015
It simply needs to be cleaned up.

345
00:30:58,365 --> 00:30:59,778
Shut up!

346
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:03,528
Come on.

347
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,656
I'll crush you!

348
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:30,471
Akamaru!

349
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,975
Oh, so you're the real one!

350
00:31:34,353 --> 00:31:35,187
<i>Multiple Fist Barrage!</i>

351
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:40,690
One more!

352
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:49,574
My brother and I get along very well.

353
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:53,411
Usually, my older brother Ukon
sleeps inside of me,

354
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:57,415
but when there's a fight,
he comes out and helps.

355
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:00,501
<i>This is this guy's ability.</i>

356
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:03,646
Ukon can stick out
his arms and legs, his head,

357
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:07,175
from anywhere in my body
and attacks or defends.

358
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:08,635
Like this, see?

359
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,472
<i>Multiple Leg Barrage!</i>

360
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:21,272
It's a three-legged kick.
Works well, doesn't it?

361
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,815
So next, it's...!

362
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:27,820
There's no time to waste, Sakon.

363
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:36,454
We'll finish this quickly!
Get into the second state!

364
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,125
All right, all right...

365
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,675
You're too impatient, bro.

366
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:59,811
I see, you're saying those horns
aren't just for display, huh?

367
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,148
<i>As soon as that right one came out,</i>

368
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,567
<i>his chakra increased massively.</i>

369
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,277
<i>Tch!</i>

370
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,948
<i>It seemed hopeless before,
but now it's even worse.</i>

371
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,789
What?! You're saying
we're going to do that?!

372
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,458
No, Akamaru!

373
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:25,795
It's too dangerous to do it here
without our comrades!

374
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:27,714
You understand, don't you?

375
00:33:28,481 --> 00:33:30,024
If we use that jutsu,

376
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:32,402
both you and I will use up
most of our chakra

377
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,845
and won't be able to move.

378
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,974
If we miss, we'll die here in vain.

379
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:44,439
Akamaru...

380
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:57,285
<i>So this is the so-called
melody of death.</i>

381
00:34:16,932 --> 00:34:18,639
<i>So she's manipulating them
with the sound of the flute.</i>

382
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,701
<i>Damn! She's getting
further and further away.</i>

383
00:34:38,967 --> 00:34:41,511
<i>What should I do?!
What is it that I should do?!</i>

384
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:42,594
<i>Huh?!</i>

385
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,708
<i>This is really looking bad!</i>

386
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:57,261
<i>What a pitiful master I am...
that you had to bite me.</i>

387
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,473
<i>I understand, Akamaru.</i>

388
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,768
<i>Just like you said,
we only have that left!</i>

389
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:06,813
<i>Wolf Fang Over Fang!</i>

390
00:35:21,118 --> 00:35:22,119
Now, Akamaru!

391
00:35:23,076 --> 00:35:23,660
What?!

392
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,833
It's Dynamic Marking!

393
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:30,044
Playing dirty like that!

394
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,547
<i>All preparations are done!</i>

395
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,884
<i>Inuzuka Style: Man-Beast Transformation Combo!</i>

396
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:48,938
<i>Two-Headed Wolf!</i>

397
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:00,658
I wondered what it was going
to be and

398
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:02,910
it turned out to be
a drooling runt of a dog.

399
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,246
What can a dog like this do?

400
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,208
Take this!

401
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:15,298
Drool?!

402
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:17,216
Sakon, what are you doing!
To the right!

403
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:18,342
Damn!

404
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,261
<i>Wolf Fang Over Fang!</i>

405
00:36:40,315 --> 00:36:41,917
<i>Heh! How's that!</i>

406
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,827
<i>Wolf Fang Over Fang's rotation speed
is too fast.</i>

407
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:49,040
<i>It's such an intense, high-speed rotation
that our visibility becomes zero.</i>

408
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,667
<i>Even without direct contact,
flesh is cut...</i>

409
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,753
<i>A direct hit
and you're torn to pieces.</i>

410
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,400
Really... getting carried away...

411
00:37:16,974 --> 00:37:21,145
Perfect timing.
We were thinking of separating anyway.

412
00:37:21,556 --> 00:37:24,309
<i>What?! He split into two?!</i>

413
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:25,493
It's true...

414
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:30,831
If we'd taken that hit as one,
it would've been bad, but...

415
00:37:31,244 --> 00:37:32,946
The real battle begins now.

416
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,586
<i>Damn it...</i>

417
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:41,092
<i>Yeah... I know Akamaru.</i>

418
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,511
<i>One more shot of
Wolf Fang Over Fang.</i>

419
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,680
<i>The next one is our limit.</i>

420
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,085
<i>We'll take them down with this!</i>

421
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:51,852
<i>Wolf Fang Over Fang!</i>

422
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,402
<i>It's no use hiding!</i>

423
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:02,071
<i>I told you we don't chase
with our eyes!</i>

424
00:38:02,803 --> 00:38:06,641
<i>We attack by chasing smells
we've marked with our noses!</i>

425
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,580
- <i>A!</i>
- <i>Un!</i>

426
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,124
- <i>Summoning...</i>
- <i>Summoning...</i>

427
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:15,793
- <i>Rashomon!</i>
- <i>Rashomon!</i>

428
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,885
<i>That's an impressive power...</i>

429
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,762
<i>To turn Rashomon,</i>

430
00:38:26,787 --> 00:38:30,624
<i>the ultimate defense meant to protect
Lord Orochimaru, into this state.</i>

431
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:31,976
<i>But...</i>

432
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,566
- <i>This is the end!</i>
- <i>This is the end!</i>

433
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,075
Akamaru!

434
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,746
<i>Akamaru...
To protect me, you...</i>

435
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,384
Damn! He did it again!

436
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,084
My eyes...!

437
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,086
<i>Damn!</i>

438
00:38:59,453 --> 00:39:02,789
Damn...!
This time it's not ordinary piss!

439
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:06,344
It feels like my eyes are burning
with strong acid!

440
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:07,811
<i>Where's the other one?!</i>

441
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:09,513
Hey...

442
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,184
Who are you looking for?

443
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:19,547
I'll take care of the rest.
Go wash your eyes in that river.

444
00:39:23,908 --> 00:39:27,828
This is my ability...
specialized in assassination.

445
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:33,037
You can't beat me just by
having a good nose and claws.

446
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,873
You can't beat my ability!

447
00:39:38,539 --> 00:39:40,792
You know that the chakra network
through which chakra flows

448
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:44,715
is deeply interwoven with each
internal organ, right?

449
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:50,221
The chakra network is interwoven
in a variety of complicated ways

450
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:53,724
and is linked to the tissues that
make up each organ.

451
00:39:54,177 --> 00:39:56,304
Also to each cell that makes up
the tissues,

452
00:39:56,394 --> 00:40:00,940
and even to proteins,
which are the main component of cells...

453
00:40:01,553 --> 00:40:03,013
In the second state,

454
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:08,531
I can dismantle or reconstruct these cells
or proteins as I wish by using chakra.

455
00:40:09,888 --> 00:40:11,348
To put it simply,

456
00:40:11,592 --> 00:40:14,887
I can break my body down into particles,
enter my opponent's body...

457
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:18,290
and then reform inside their body
and come back out.

458
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,084
<i>Akamaru...</i>

459
00:40:20,821 --> 00:40:23,307
<i>I'm sorry... Akamaru...!</i>

460
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:28,259
<i>However, this time,
I'm sunk...</i>

461
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:33,806
My cells can swim inside
your body as I wish,

462
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:36,501
and I can even target
and destroy only your cells.

463
00:40:36,548 --> 00:40:39,259
In other words,
a slight state of fusion.

464
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:42,022
We'll be sharing a body, so to speak.

465
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,775
Sharing?

466
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:50,239
That's right... a cruel way
of killing that only I can do...

467
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:54,785
Little by little, I'm tearing
your cells apart from the inside.

468
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:56,370
<i>I see.</i>

469
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,254
If that's the case...!

470
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:18,490
Let's see what happens if I do this!

471
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,650
Suicide?! That's ridiculous!

472
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,068
Die with me...

473
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:39,622
What are you thinking?!

474
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,333
Are you in pain?

475
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,504
All right then, let's end this now.

476
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:02,952
<i>There's not enough blood...</i>

477
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:19,954
<i>Damn!</i>

478
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:24,667
Damn...

479
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,475
Where'd he go?

480
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:44,019
So he left his little dog behind
and fled.

481
00:42:45,046 --> 00:42:49,634
It's the right decision,
but he's more cold-hearted than me.

482
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:55,188
What?!

483
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,615
It couldn't be!

484
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:14,258
<i>What a relief...
He's still breathing.</i>

485
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:19,763
<i>What a relief!</i>

486
00:43:26,331 --> 00:43:29,917
<i>Akamaru... You really gave it your best.</i>

487
00:43:31,098 --> 00:43:34,268
<i>Because of you, I was able to stall
the enemy for a while.</i>

488
00:43:34,833 --> 00:43:36,505
<i>We've managed to injure
the enemy too.</i>

489
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,161
<i>It's enough... You've done enough.</i>

490
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:01,096
I'll kill you!

491
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:08,103
Hey! Sakon! Where are you?! Sakon!

492
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,066
Sakon!

493
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,235
Sakon!

494
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:21,408
Enough already.
You're so noisy, Big Brother.

495
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,370
Your yelling stings my eyes...

496
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:26,997
Big Brother!

497
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:29,642
I'll kill him... is what I'd like to do,

498
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,377
but it's almost time for my sleep.

499
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:35,422
Capture those bastards alive in my place.

500
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:38,092
When I wake up,
I'll kill them.

501
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:41,762
All right, Sakon?
Capture them alive...

502
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:44,014
Yeah, I got it...

503
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:45,516
But...

504
00:44:46,485 --> 00:44:48,529
The killing part,
we'll do it together.

505
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:04,118
Behold!

506
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:05,744
<i>Willow Dance!</i>

507
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:39,695
Bones?

508
00:45:48,522 --> 00:45:51,749
This is my... Kekkei Genkai.

509
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,852
<i>What's with this guy...?</i>

510
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:15,522
<i>Is he attacking with bones sticking out
from all over his body?</i>

511
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:54,812
<i>He's grabbed his own bone!</i>

512
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:01,902
It'll be soon...

513
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:08,909
<i>He's turning the bone...
into a sword!</i>

514
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:21,547
It's futile. It's not just ordinary bone.

515
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:27,010
My densest bones are as hard as steel.

516
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:31,640
So what?! I'll just have to break it!

517
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,768
I possess five Dances.

518
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:42,150
You'd better not think
you know my strength from just this.

519
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:43,151
What?!

520
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,907
Allow me to demonstrate...

521
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,077
The Dance of the Camellia.

522
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:55,247
Come!

523
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,875
I'll crush you!

524
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:07,801
<i>They're getting closer and closer.</i>

525
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,263
<i>Damn!</i>

526
00:48:18,386 --> 00:48:20,722
<i>This isn't good, traces of blood!</i>

527
00:48:21,654 --> 00:48:25,491
<i>Damn, I did save Akamaru
for the time being,</i>

528
00:48:25,949 --> 00:48:27,992
<i>but maybe I went too far.</i>

529
00:48:41,526 --> 00:48:44,195
<i>This smell...
What does it mean?</i>

530
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:48,258
<i>Why... Why are those guys
headed to a place like this?!</i>

531
00:48:49,144 --> 00:48:51,021
<i>I don't understand anymore.</i>

532
00:48:51,556 --> 00:48:54,434
<i>In any case,
we need to leave this place quickly.</i>

533
00:48:58,602 --> 00:48:59,645
<i>I can't...</i>

534
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,773
<i>I'm starting to feel light-headed
from the pain and loss of blood...</i>

535
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:06,234
<i>My body won't move at all either...</i>

536
00:49:11,526 --> 00:49:12,903
<i>Akamaru...</i>

537
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:38,874
<i>Huh?</i>

538
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:47,067
<i>So he fled by floating down the river...</i>

539
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,152
Damn!

540
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:55,951
Damn!

541
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:04,835
<i>Damn...</i>

542
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:07,045
This is it!

543
00:50:08,133 --> 00:50:11,845
So, I've cornered you, you stinking rat!

544
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,014
Pretty impressive...

545
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:21,643
You timed the attacks of those three well.

546
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,479
You must have practiced quite a bit, huh?

547
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,899
Since it's a pretty complicated song...

548
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:30,652
Well now...

549
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:33,113
Not only did you
immediately understand

550
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,657
that I'm manipulating these guys
with my flute,

551
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:40,370
you understood how difficult this song is.
You're a pretty impressive punk.

552
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:45,208
But you can't completely
understand this song.

553
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:51,465
You're so right...
since art is so foreign to me.

554
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:55,886
<i>But since she uses that flute
to manipulate,</i>

555
00:50:56,297 --> 00:51:00,469
<i>it means that song must contain
individually specific sound patterns</i>

556
00:51:00,494 --> 00:51:03,872
<i>to control every single move
those guys make.</i>

557
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:08,190
<i>I'm pretty confident
when it comes to just analyzing,</i>

558
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,442
<i>but this time it's not looking good.</i>

559
00:51:14,315 --> 00:51:15,486
<i>The reason is that</i>

560
00:51:16,212 --> 00:51:18,991
<i>I don't understand
musical notes whatsoever.</i>

561
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:22,871
There's no one that's heard
this song and lived.

562
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:26,958
<i>Demonic Flute: Phantom Sound Chains!</i>

563
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:42,766
<i>The melody's changed!</i>

564
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:47,395
<i>Something's going to come!</i>

565
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,202
What the...?!

566
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:17,926
What?

567
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,396
This is...?

568
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:39,197
<i>The speed at which he flees
after determining</i>

569
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:40,973
<i>that these Chakra Phantoms
are dangerous...</i>

570
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:42,617
<i>Pretty impressive.</i>

571
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:45,370
<i>But...</i>

572
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:58,675
<i>I've used my precious paper bombs
and smoke bombs all at once</i>

573
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,635
<i>and all I could do was hide.</i>

574
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:03,972
<i>That white one...</i>

575
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:07,976
<i>drained my physical energy.</i>

576
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:16,818
<i>Seeing that shuriken passed through,</i>

577
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:19,905
<i>that thing is
partially materialized.</i>

578
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,782
<i>It's chakra itself with an appetite.</i>

579
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:28,208
<i>It's probably chakra that's shaped
mostly by mental energy.</i>

580
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:32,459
<i>That's why it seeks stability
and craves physical energy.</i>

581
00:53:33,518 --> 00:53:36,479
<i>If I continue dealing with
those hungry chakra forms</i>

582
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:37,881
<i>I won't be able to build up my chakra.</i>

583
00:53:39,114 --> 00:53:40,699
<i>They're pretty dangerous.</i>

584
00:53:42,515 --> 00:53:45,393
<i>She's a shinobi who can
make special chakra like me...</i>

585
00:53:46,037 --> 00:53:48,206
<i>It's without a doubt, a secret ninjutsu.</i>

586
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:52,354
<i>Which means I should leave
the white thing alone</i>

587
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:54,482
<i>and aim for the main body!</i>

588
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:59,194
<i>The quickest way would be
to stop the sound of the flute, but...</i>

589
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:04,241
<i>it'd be impossible to get close to
that woman in this situation.</i>

590
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:11,414
<i>The next thing would be to capture
those three with Shadow Possession Jutsu.</i>

591
00:54:12,232 --> 00:54:16,727
<i>But that's difficult too since they're
attacking me separately at different times</i>

592
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:22,425
<i>If I let even one get free,
I'd be attacked and it'd be the end...</i>

593
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:27,138
<i>This woman has no openings
in her offense or defense...</i>

594
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:31,017
<i>Heh! I bet she's a good Shogi player.</i>

595
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:36,555
<i>My remaining ninja tools
are twelve kunai knives,</i>

596
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:42,127
<i>nine shuriken, twelve meters of wire,
one flash bomb and one paper bomb...</i>

597
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,240
<i>Man...</i>

598
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:49,035
<i>It feels like playing a game
without my rook and bishop.</i>

599
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:55,625
<i>There's no use hiding.</i>

600
00:54:57,294 --> 00:55:00,005
<i>Unless you can predict
these guys' movements</i>

601
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,673
<i>there's nowhere to run, you little rat.</i>

602
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,551
<i>I'll find you and tear you to pieces!</i>

603
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:09,514
<i>All right. Everything's in place.
Now I just have to do it.</i>

604
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:13,560
<i>There'll be nine attacks.</i>

605
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:15,478
<i>The outcome will be decided
in these next few moves.</i>

606
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:17,480
<i>One!</i>

607
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:27,699
<i>Wishful thinking!</i>

608
00:55:27,963 --> 00:55:30,340
<i>A jutsu controlled by sound
is invincible.</i>

609
00:55:30,595 --> 00:55:33,973
<i>Any plan you have to beat me...
is useless!</i>

610
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:44,257
<i>Two!</i>

611
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:49,929
<i>Scampering around, you little rat!
Where are you?!</i>

612
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:56,269
<i>Three!</i>

613
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:03,818
<i>So you're over there!</i>

614
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:14,412
<i>Four!</i>

615
00:56:19,191 --> 00:56:21,569
<i>So it's a cheap trick.
You think you can make a fool of me?!</i>

616
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:28,093
<i>Five... six...</i>

617
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:29,886
<i>seven... eight...</i>

618
00:56:36,017 --> 00:56:40,063
<i>Scurrying around to get away.
What is he thinking?</i>

619
00:56:53,594 --> 00:56:54,386
<i>Light?!</i>

620
00:56:54,424 --> 00:56:55,341
<i>Nine!</i>

621
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:56,329
<i>Oh no!</i>

622
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:59,499
<i>He's lengthened the shadows
with light and...</i>

623
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:01,459
<i>Shadow Possession Jutsu!</i>

624
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:06,214
Shadow Possession Jutsu...
a success!

625
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:07,507
That's impossible...

626
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,094
How were you able to predict
these guys' movements?!

627
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:15,765
There's no way you could have heard
the differences in my music patterns!

628
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:21,062
I wasn't listening to
the sounds at all.

629
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:23,398
There's something other
than the sounds

630
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:26,443
that give away your command patterns,
isn't there?

631
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:32,991
Your fingers!

632
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:35,076
It can't be!

633
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,454
The movement of the three...

634
00:57:37,632 --> 00:57:40,052
You're saying you predicted their movements
by memorizing my fingering?

635
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,793
There's no way that's possible!

636
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,796
Your right index finger
and ring finger...

637
00:57:48,286 --> 00:57:49,899
The sound that you make
with those

638
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:52,302
along with the left middle finger
and pinkie,

639
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:55,311
the one with the pincer-like arms
gets ready to move.

640
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:00,435
Your right thumb and index finger,

641
00:58:00,746 --> 00:58:05,267
and your left index and little fingers,
the one with the club charges.

642
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:11,529
While you were dodging my attacks
and looking for me,

643
00:58:12,108 --> 00:58:16,134
I was observing each of your
finger movements in detail...

644
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:20,955
analyzing and memorizing them.

645
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:30,131
It's no use...

646
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:33,176
They're bound by
Shadow Possession Jutsu.

647
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:38,932
The most interesting rule
of Shogi is that

648
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:44,395
you can use pieces you obtain
as your own pieces.

649
00:58:46,238 --> 00:58:48,614
Now... it's my turn to attack.

650
00:58:49,102 --> 00:58:53,000
This time, I'll hunt you down
with these three pieces.

651
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:56,908
You're looking pretty composed.

652
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,369
You should at least have a kunai ready.

653
00:58:59,696 --> 00:59:01,698
My weapon is just this flute!

654
00:59:02,766 --> 00:59:04,832
I already told you, there's no one

655
00:59:04,857 --> 00:59:06,759
who's heard the sound of
this flute and lived, idiot!

656
00:59:07,283 --> 00:59:08,826
That's some confidence!

657
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:14,551
<i>Retreat!</i>

658
00:59:20,886 --> 00:59:24,556
Too bad you aren't able to
use those pieces, idiot!

659
00:59:29,143 --> 00:59:30,645
Next it's my turn!

660
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:35,613
What?!

661
00:59:37,411 --> 00:59:39,121
Shadow Possession Jutsu,
successful.

662
00:59:49,435 --> 00:59:50,603
I told you.

663
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:52,880
That I'd hunt you down
using those pieces.

664
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:57,885
I used them as bait.

665
00:59:58,344 --> 01:00:01,639
The first move is always a feint.

666
01:00:02,306 --> 01:00:04,808
The basic strategy is to land a hit
with the second move.

667
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:06,144
Bastard...

668
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:15,194
<i>It can't be helped.</i>

669
01:00:15,493 --> 01:00:17,916
<i>Now that it's come to this,
I'll have to force my way out.</i>

670
01:00:18,793 --> 01:00:21,879
<i>I didn't think I'd have to use
State 2 in a place like this...</i>

671
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,090
<i>It ticks me off but...</i>

672
01:00:24,373 --> 01:00:25,708
<i>I'll acknowledge it.</i>

673
01:00:26,077 --> 01:00:28,579
<i>For a scumbag, he's pretty sharp.</i>

674
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:37,258
What is... this?

675
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:43,389
It's true you're somewhat sharp, but...

676
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:46,976
It won't go as
you've planned from here!

677
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:48,353
<i>What?!</i>

678
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:56,361
<i>Is she going to force herself out
of the Shadow Possession Jutsu?</i>

679
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:58,896
<i>What's with that tremendous chakra?</i>

680
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:02,700
<i>The jutsu's going to come loose!</i>

681
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:04,869
<i>I can't be worrying about
saving chakra anymore.</i>

682
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:10,375
<i>There's no other way
but to use that jutsu!</i>

683
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:13,419
<i>Ninja Art: Shadow Strangulation Jutsu!</i>

684
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:23,388
<i>Is he grabbing my body
with the shadow?</i>

685
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:26,057
<i>It's just as if I'm being grabbed
by a real hand...</i>

686
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,477
But this is as far as you go!

687
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:32,563
<i>Damn! What incredible strength.</i>

688
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:35,024
<i>At this distance
I'll lose to that strength!</i>

689
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:37,402
<i>Take this!</i>

690
01:01:38,242 --> 01:01:40,828
<i>Demonic Flute: Chains of Fantasia!</i>

691
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:48,413
<i>This is bad!</i>

692
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:50,998
<i>Is this a... genjutsu?</i>

693
01:01:58,423 --> 01:02:00,007
<i>Where are you aiming?</i>

694
01:02:08,766 --> 01:02:11,060
<i>I can't move my body...</i>

695
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:39,714
<i>While in State 2,</i>

696
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:42,550
<i>I manipulate many genjutsu
with my flute.</i>

697
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:46,596
<i>Of those, this one is
appropriate for that little rat.</i>

698
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:47,972
<i>The reason is...</i>

699
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:55,229
<i>his genjutsu paralyzes
and binds its prey!</i>

700
01:02:58,729 --> 01:03:01,482
Well? How does it feel
to be the one tied up?

701
01:03:08,334 --> 01:03:09,569
Little rat!

702
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:14,373
What...?

703
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:20,713
<i>This guy...</i>

704
01:03:21,184 --> 01:03:23,311
<i>He broke his own finger
with his shadow!</i>

705
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,385
<i>Did he release the genjutsu
with the pain?</i>

706
01:03:26,844 --> 01:03:29,222
<i>On top of that, he kept pretending to
be bound by the jutsu?!</i>

707
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:35,728
I told you this already...

708
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:37,939
The first hand is the trick,
a fake.

709
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:41,234
The basic strategy is to score
with the second move.

710
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:46,614
And this second move...
is a bit different from the last one.

711
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:48,324
With the Shadow Strangle Jutsu,

712
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:53,955
the closer in distance you are
to the subject the stronger the hold.

713
01:03:54,872 --> 01:03:58,292
Damn. I carelessly got too close...

714
01:03:58,751 --> 01:04:00,336
No, that's not it.

715
01:04:02,964 --> 01:04:04,382
<i>You're looking pretty composed.</i>

716
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:07,009
<i>Stand ready with a kunai at least.</i>

717
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:09,470
<i>My weapon is just this flute!</i>

718
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:12,223
<i>I told you that
there hasn't been a person</i>

719
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:14,559
<i>who's heard the sound of this flute
and lived, idiot!</i>

720
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:16,477
No way...

721
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:18,563
That's right.

722
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:23,150
The reason I threw the kunai
right in front of you and missed...

723
01:04:24,735 --> 01:04:29,991
It was to lead you to pick it up
and come closer to me, understand?

724
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:35,079
I'll acknowledge you.

725
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:37,665
You're not only sharp...

726
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:39,667
You're also very determined...

727
01:04:41,771 --> 01:04:44,398
And besides... I'm a gentleman.

728
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:50,720
Striking a helpless woman
is against my policy...

729
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:52,388
But however I look at it,

730
01:04:52,413 --> 01:04:55,249
you don't exactly seem like
a helpless woman...

731
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:57,977
in your case!

732
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:03,858
Don't be getting full of yourself

733
01:05:03,883 --> 01:05:07,262
just because you released
the genjutsu, you little clod...!

734
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:11,157
<i>She's still not completely bound.</i>

735
01:05:11,182 --> 01:05:12,266
<i>Damn it...</i>

736
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:15,536
<i>I can't lose!</i>

737
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:22,835
<i>A little more...</i>

738
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:45,858
<i>What incredible chakra!</i>

739
01:05:46,233 --> 01:05:47,860
<i>Even if I bind her
at point-blank range,</i>

740
01:05:48,051 --> 01:05:49,886
<i>she still pushes back...</i>

741
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:54,617
<i>But, I'll get hammered
for sure if I let go now.</i>

742
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:59,914
<i>After all, I just have to settle this
with this jutsu.</i>

743
01:06:29,082 --> 01:06:31,292
<i>As I thought, things are getting risky</i>

744
01:06:31,434 --> 01:06:33,186
<i>if I stay in the water any longer
with this wound...</i>

745
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:01,726
Damn it!

746
01:07:17,295 --> 01:07:19,589
One more... to go...

747
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:23,706
<i>This guy's crazy strong...</i>

748
01:07:25,886 --> 01:07:28,754
<i>Not a single hit with that
many shadow clones...</i>

749
01:07:30,629 --> 01:07:31,881
It's about time...

750
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:34,216
I've been eagerly waiting.

751
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:42,725
Lord Orochimaru's ambition...
The first step...

752
01:07:57,615 --> 01:07:58,616
Sasuke...

753
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:05,498
Sasuke! What are you doing
with these guys?!

754
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:07,666
Come on! We're going home!

755
01:08:13,397 --> 01:08:14,773
Sasuke...

756
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:18,520
You can hear
my voice, can't you?!

757
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:22,598
Wait, Sasuke!

758
01:08:22,723 --> 01:08:24,016
It's futile.

759
01:08:24,391 --> 01:08:25,142
Die.

760
01:08:33,984 --> 01:08:34,944
Who are you?

761
01:08:38,989 --> 01:08:40,282
The rejuvenated...

762
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:44,078
Hidden Leaf's Handsome Devil...

763
01:08:51,335 --> 01:08:52,628
Rock Lee!

764
01:08:59,009 --> 01:09:00,970
B-Bushy Brow?

765
01:09:05,843 --> 01:09:08,012
Bushy Brow, you!
What about your body...?

766
01:09:08,185 --> 01:09:10,813
More importantly, Naruto.
Go get Sasuke.

767
01:09:12,189 --> 01:09:13,941
But... you...

768
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:18,237
Please leave this one to me!

769
01:09:22,644 --> 01:09:25,314
<i>This guy's... good...</i>

770
01:09:26,463 --> 01:09:31,134
Bushy Brow! Be careful!
He uses his own bones to attack.

771
01:09:31,653 --> 01:09:34,489
Bones... you say?

772
01:09:37,434 --> 01:09:41,313
He's crazy strong...

773
01:09:44,017 --> 01:09:46,686
What are you doing?!
Please go, quickly!

774
01:09:47,562 --> 01:09:48,287
Naruto...

775
01:09:49,316 --> 01:09:52,911
You made a "promise of a lifetime"
to Sakura with that pose, right?!

776
01:09:55,954 --> 01:09:58,707
<i>I'll bring back Sasuke, no matter what!</i>

777
01:09:59,173 --> 01:10:01,258
<i>It's a promise of a lifetime!</i>

778
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:05,158
This man... I'll defeat him!

779
01:10:07,409 --> 01:10:08,326
I promise!

780
01:10:10,525 --> 01:10:11,126
Right!

781
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:16,670
<i>I won't let you!</i>

782
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:20,341
Die.

783
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:24,303
Please don't ignore me!

784
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:26,639
Oh...

785
01:10:30,017 --> 01:10:31,060
<i>Bushy Brow...</i>

786
01:10:35,981 --> 01:10:36,899
However...

787
01:10:37,964 --> 01:10:41,092
If Sasuke is inside that coffin...

788
01:10:41,235 --> 01:10:45,906
It's impossible for a team of Genin
to take them on...

789
01:10:46,116 --> 01:10:48,992
I'm not such a fool.

790
01:10:50,871 --> 01:10:54,124
I anticipated that already
and it's been taken care of.

791
01:10:58,748 --> 01:10:59,624
In here!

792
01:11:08,847 --> 01:11:11,016
What's wrong, Guy?
You're on the brink of exhaustion.

793
01:11:11,616 --> 01:11:12,993
Did something happen
on your mission?

794
01:11:13,018 --> 01:11:18,357
No... I finished the mission
and ran back as fast as I could...

795
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:22,528
More importantly...

796
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:28,450
Lee! What happened with
Lee's surgery?!

797
01:11:34,164 --> 01:11:35,416
It was a success.

798
01:11:37,167 --> 01:11:40,879
He can start training tomorrow
if it's just for jutsu.

799
01:11:45,342 --> 01:11:49,722
Well, bed rest for a while
would be best though.

800
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:52,349
Th-There's trouble, Lady Hokage.

801
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:55,769
Rock Lee is gone!

802
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:02,865
No!

803
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:07,573
Damn it... Last night while
I treated Genma and Raido?

804
01:12:08,006 --> 01:12:10,634
That fool... He went after them.

805
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:14,302
He must've been really flustered...

806
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:18,913
He mistook my bottle of sake for
a bottle of medicine...

807
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,018
<i>Sake?!</i>

808
01:12:39,396 --> 01:12:40,856
Uh... Uh oh...

809
01:12:55,829 --> 01:12:59,166
<i>He's agile... My kicks don't hit.</i>

810
01:13:00,493 --> 01:13:02,161
You're flexible to a surprising extent...

811
01:13:02,186 --> 01:13:04,814
And your movements are certainly unique.

812
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:09,676
You're too... straight forward.

813
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:18,268
It's over...

814
01:13:19,978 --> 01:13:21,230
Please wait!

815
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:28,779
I'm sorry.
It's about time for my medicine!

816
01:13:29,082 --> 01:13:30,917
I have to be sure to drink it, so...

817
01:13:31,115 --> 01:13:32,032
Excuse me a moment.

818
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:45,031
I've always disliked medicine.

819
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:54,847
It... happened before when
I took him to a restaurant

820
01:13:54,888 --> 01:13:57,224
to celebrate his learning
the Hidden Lotus.

821
01:13:58,725 --> 01:14:01,728
Lee mistook my sake for water...

822
01:14:04,898 --> 01:14:07,693
As soon as he drank just
a small cup...

823
01:14:11,107 --> 01:14:14,356
of the sake, things got ugly...

824
01:14:14,792 --> 01:14:16,126
Got ugly...?

825
01:14:17,156 --> 01:14:19,323
After a silence, like the calm
before a storm...

826
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:23,911
The moment I realized it...

827
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:25,794
The restaurant...

828
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:29,840
was completely wrecked...

829
01:14:33,093 --> 01:14:36,096
Medicine always tastes strange...

830
01:14:48,195 --> 01:14:52,199
<i>What...? What did this guy drink?</i>

831
01:14:56,094 --> 01:14:59,056
He went on an incredible drunken rampage!

832
01:15:04,134 --> 01:15:07,346
Who the hell are you?! Hey!

833
01:15:07,711 --> 01:15:10,672
Who are you anyway?

834
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:13,989
Acting cool... So irritating...

835
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:20,349
<i>Hence, he's a natural user of...</i>

836
01:15:26,063 --> 01:15:28,398
<i>Drunken Fist!</i>

837
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:34,988
If you're not going to come...
then I'll go!

838
01:15:38,116 --> 01:15:41,119
<i>His attacks are straightforward
as usual, but...</i>

839
01:15:42,663 --> 01:15:43,455
Oh!

840
01:15:48,418 --> 01:15:50,379
Ouch!

841
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:52,965
It's your fault!

842
01:16:06,144 --> 01:16:08,772
I... I...!

843
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:11,483
I'm enjoying my youth!

844
01:16:16,154 --> 01:16:17,489
<i>He's too unorthodox...</i>

845
01:16:18,514 --> 01:16:20,325
<i>And most of all... he's fast!</i>

846
01:16:21,156 --> 01:16:24,409
Right in the middle of my youth...

847
01:16:33,797 --> 01:16:35,090
<i>Dance of the Camellia!</i>

848
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:42,598
<i>Here!</i>

849
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:17,716
<i>I can't read his movements...</i>

850
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:23,722
<i>To land an attack on me...
That's quite some taijutsu...</i>

851
01:17:25,223 --> 01:17:26,725
<i>I have no choice...</i>

852
01:17:36,276 --> 01:17:39,029
My special ability is bones...

853
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:43,033
You heard that
from the Shadow Clone brat, right?

854
01:17:45,369 --> 01:17:47,829
I'll sober you up right away.

855
01:17:48,413 --> 01:17:52,042
I'm... not drunk... or anything!

856
01:17:54,211 --> 01:17:56,213
Then I'll wake you up!

857
01:17:58,882 --> 01:18:00,509
I'm not drunk or anything!

858
01:18:01,498 --> 01:18:03,791
In the first place, I'm a minor!

859
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:08,710
Minors shouldn't drink at all!

860
01:18:18,538 --> 01:18:24,085
Unorthodox, isn't it?
This is my Kekkei Genkai.

861
01:18:34,334 --> 01:18:36,870
<i>Humph. With that wound...</i>

862
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:41,133
<i>It seems he wasn't able
to escape very far at all...</i>

863
01:18:50,577 --> 01:18:52,897
<i>This is my limit...
I can't move...</i>

864
01:19:01,245 --> 01:19:04,634
<i>Damn it...
He's already caught up?</i>

865
01:19:06,283 --> 01:19:07,576
<i>And...</i>

866
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:11,037
My head's pounding...

867
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:13,707
And what's with this wound...?

868
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:17,627
It seems I was drunk, huh...?

869
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:21,465
Your appearance...!

870
01:19:21,798 --> 01:19:27,512
It seems you've sobered up...
This is my Kekkei Genkai...

871
01:19:28,472 --> 01:19:30,557
<i>Kekkei genkai...</i>

872
01:19:32,809 --> 01:19:38,356
My Kekkei Genkai freely controls
osteoblastic and osteoclastic cells...

873
01:19:39,579 --> 01:19:44,497
It even controls the concentration
of calcium. It's an ability to form bones.

874
01:19:45,155 --> 01:19:49,493
Basically, there are over two hundred
bones in the human body...

875
01:19:50,243 --> 01:19:53,455
But for me, that's not a set number.

876
01:20:00,469 --> 01:20:03,639
<i>Are these really human bones...?!</i>

877
01:20:06,676 --> 01:20:07,260
If so...!

878
01:20:10,003 --> 01:20:11,380
<i>Dance of the Larch!</i>

879
01:20:31,243 --> 01:20:32,452
<i>I've had it...</i>

880
01:20:33,087 --> 01:20:36,709
So close... you clod.

881
01:21:11,324 --> 01:21:13,326
<i>The smell is moving away...</i>

882
01:21:16,496 --> 01:21:17,497
I'm saved...

883
01:21:18,415 --> 01:21:19,332
Who is?

884
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:24,421
How?!

885
01:21:24,978 --> 01:21:26,236
I knew it...

886
01:21:29,463 --> 01:21:30,756
<i>My coat?!</i>

887
01:21:31,511 --> 01:21:36,474
It seems you didn't notice your own scent
since you're so used to it...

888
01:21:37,370 --> 01:21:40,415
With that you erased your own scent?

889
01:21:41,513 --> 01:21:48,376
You understand the nature of scents.
No wonder I didn't smell you.

890
01:21:49,696 --> 01:21:51,615
And... as expected,

891
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:54,726
it's tough to deal with
when you guys split up...

892
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,286
Damn it...

893
01:22:04,127 --> 01:22:05,545
Please wait!

894
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:10,050
The real deal... starts now!

895
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:15,555
<i>My role now is to stall this person
as long as possible...</i>

896
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:19,893
<i>So, I should've avoided any major techniques
that would leave me vulnerable...</i>

897
01:22:21,728 --> 01:22:24,022
<i>But it seems this isn't an opponent
easy enough to beat</i>

898
01:22:24,064 --> 01:22:25,774
<i>without using my secret technique...</i>

899
01:22:29,526 --> 01:22:30,485
Here I go!

900
01:22:32,072 --> 01:22:35,117
<i>I just had surgery
and am not at my best.</i>

901
01:22:35,825 --> 01:22:39,120
<i>But if I just open the first
Inner Gate, the Gate of Opening,</i>

902
01:22:39,145 --> 01:22:40,001
<i>I should somehow...</i>

903
01:22:43,833 --> 01:22:45,919
The first gate... Gate of Opening...

904
01:22:46,503 --> 01:22:47,253
Open!

905
01:22:50,674 --> 01:22:52,425
<i>Primary Lotus!</i>

906
01:22:55,178 --> 01:22:57,847
<i>The impact of the kick
was suppressed by the bones...?!</i>

907
01:22:58,348 --> 01:23:02,519
That's some speed... But it's over.

908
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:08,775
<i>Damn it... No matter how much I think,
I can't come up with any good strategies!</i>

909
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:13,613
<i>I've had it... I can't hold any longer...</i>

910
01:23:16,382 --> 01:23:20,386
With me right in front of you,
you can't even howl like a loser...?

911
01:23:21,162 --> 01:23:21,830
Eh?!

912
01:23:25,583 --> 01:23:26,418
Die!

913
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:28,753
You're mine!

914
01:23:29,921 --> 01:23:32,465
Don't you go smiling
before your death!

915
01:23:37,137 --> 01:23:38,138
What?!

916
01:23:50,108 --> 01:23:50,775
Who are you?!

917
01:23:52,193 --> 01:23:53,528
A Sand...

918
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:56,156
Shinobi...

919
01:23:57,198 --> 01:23:58,366
Ally of the Leaf!

920
01:24:08,034 --> 01:24:12,161
<i>The Sand...?! Am I still drunk...?</i>

921
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:26,061
<i>Ten-Finger Drilling Bullets!</i>

922
01:24:40,776 --> 01:24:43,570
<i>Did he shoot the bones
in his fingertips...?!</i>

923
01:24:46,289 --> 01:24:47,707
Impetuous...

924
01:24:51,252 --> 01:24:52,253
You...

925
01:24:54,402 --> 01:24:58,907
When you fought me...
you had more speed and sharpness.

926
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:01,554
Easy to say...

927
01:25:04,065 --> 01:25:06,400
It's not that I'm holding a grudge...

928
01:25:06,643 --> 01:25:11,439
But, because of you,
I've had kind of a tough time.

929
01:25:14,609 --> 01:25:15,568
I see...

930
01:25:17,265 --> 01:25:19,308
But... why you?

931
01:25:21,825 --> 01:25:23,868
I owe a lot...

932
01:25:26,587 --> 01:25:28,464
<i>to the Leaf.</i>

933
01:25:29,999 --> 01:25:31,459
Sasuke!

934
01:25:38,864 --> 01:25:42,334
I heard you Sand traitors
reconciled with the Leaf...

935
01:25:42,905 --> 01:25:45,365
But to think you'd switch sides
so easily...

936
01:25:46,045 --> 01:25:49,561
It's not like we attacked the Leaf
for the fun of it...

937
01:25:50,738 --> 01:25:51,843
It was an order...

938
01:25:53,077 --> 01:25:55,636
In the same way
that I'm here now.

939
01:25:58,153 --> 01:26:00,864
<i>I see. The Fifth Hokage
asked the Sand...</i>

940
01:26:01,447 --> 01:26:02,492
<i>That's a big help.</i>

941
01:26:03,996 --> 01:26:08,192
By the way...
has your sharpness gotten worse?

942
01:26:08,673 --> 01:26:09,340
Huh?

943
01:26:12,048 --> 01:26:14,216
Are you going to give up again
or something?

944
01:26:14,698 --> 01:26:16,802
This time, I'll finish it for you!

945
01:26:17,876 --> 01:26:20,379
Sorry, but I can't give up.

946
01:26:20,884 --> 01:26:23,761
A man mustn't be protected
by a woman, so...

947
01:26:25,503 --> 01:26:28,200
As usual, you're annoying
with the man and woman stuff.

948
01:26:28,766 --> 01:26:31,603
Even if you act tough, it's totally obvious
that it's bravado, you idiot!

949
01:26:35,648 --> 01:26:37,692
This time you're taking sides
with the Leaf, huh?!

950
01:26:37,908 --> 01:26:40,578
You guys sure are busy
all over the place!

951
01:26:41,863 --> 01:26:43,948
She uses genjutsu
with the sound of her flute.

952
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:44,908
Right!

953
01:26:45,366 --> 01:26:47,255
<i>Cyclone Scythe Jutsu!</i>

954
01:26:57,629 --> 01:26:59,505
<i>Blowing away the sounds of the flute</i>

955
01:26:59,589 --> 01:27:02,425
<i>and being able to nail the opponent
with a physical attack.</i>

956
01:27:02,675 --> 01:27:04,719
<i>To think she can attack and defend
with one move...</i>

957
01:27:04,802 --> 01:27:07,472
<i>Unlike me, she has a nice jutsu.</i>

958
01:27:15,021 --> 01:27:17,607
<i>That woman's a natural enemy to me!</i>

959
01:27:22,558 --> 01:27:26,674
Has Ukon caught him yet, like we planned?

960
01:27:35,041 --> 01:27:36,709
Puppet, huh?

961
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:40,171
Behind you!

962
01:27:44,175 --> 01:27:45,677
I can't... move.

963
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:48,221
What's this guy?

964
01:27:51,015 --> 01:27:53,893
I leave this to you, Sakon! Do it!

965
01:27:57,188 --> 01:28:01,401
Be careful!
They enter the body and start to fuse!

966
01:28:02,068 --> 01:28:03,281
It's too late.

967
01:28:22,338 --> 01:28:24,424
It seems like...

968
01:28:24,668 --> 01:28:27,712
your jutsu doesn't work... on puppets.

969
01:28:28,511 --> 01:28:29,804
<i>This is a puppet, too?!</i>

970
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:35,101
Let me tell you this.

971
01:28:35,226 --> 01:28:39,439
We Sand ninja aren't as soft as the Leaf.

972
01:28:39,731 --> 01:28:43,818
And another thing,
don't carelessly approach...

973
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:48,364
the Black Ant!

974
01:28:53,745 --> 01:28:55,830
<i>He was fearsome
when he was an enemy...</i>

975
01:28:55,882 --> 01:28:59,010
<i>But to think he'd be this
dependable as an ally.</i>

976
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:20,813
Ow... I got careless.
Let me rest in your body for a bit.

977
01:29:21,189 --> 01:29:22,857
Good for nothing guy...

978
01:29:23,483 --> 01:29:25,151
Who are these guys?

979
01:29:25,592 --> 01:29:27,385
This is their ability!

980
01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:30,531
Although you were caught off guard...

981
01:29:30,698 --> 01:29:33,493
you getting hammered
by that puppet play...

982
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:35,161
Well...

983
01:29:35,912 --> 01:29:39,123
Its power and speed
are nothing special.

984
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:42,043
I won't be beaten
by the likes of such a toy.

985
01:29:44,170 --> 01:29:48,966
<i>He's already healed.
What incredible regenerative abilities...</i>

986
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:55,556
Ordinarily, I'm not the one
who becomes the main body,

987
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:57,475
so it's hard to move, damn it.

988
01:29:59,036 --> 01:30:01,330
He's not an opponent
you can beat fighting head on!

989
01:30:01,521 --> 01:30:02,980
We should retreat for now and...

990
01:30:05,191 --> 01:30:08,069
We can't back down after being mocked like that.

991
01:30:26,003 --> 01:30:28,798
The Black Ant isn't a mechanism
for attacking.

992
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:31,509
Primarily, it's just for capturing.

993
01:30:32,385 --> 01:30:37,223
And... Crow paired up with the Black Ant
is exclusively for attacking.

994
01:30:37,932 --> 01:30:43,229
<i>Hey you! Let me out!</i>

995
01:30:56,784 --> 01:30:59,454
<i>Black Secret Technique: Iron Maiden!</i>

996
01:31:13,426 --> 01:31:15,261
She hid, huh...?

997
01:31:15,761 --> 01:31:18,514
I told you to just explain the situation.

998
01:31:20,349 --> 01:31:24,574
Don't misjudge my power...

999
01:31:25,594 --> 01:31:28,138
If she thinks
she's hiding from me...

1000
01:31:28,191 --> 01:31:32,195
yet stays close enough for the sound
of her flute to reach...

1001
01:31:34,155 --> 01:31:35,364
she's naïve!

1002
01:31:36,132 --> 01:31:39,885
<i>Summoning: Blade Dance!</i>

1003
01:31:42,656 --> 01:31:43,336
<i>Cut!</i>

1004
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:46,792
<i>All right...</i>

1005
01:31:48,085 --> 01:31:50,588
<i>I've made it this far.
It's about time for my genjutsu...</i>

1006
01:31:51,714 --> 01:31:52,423
<i>Huh?</i>

1007
01:32:22,495 --> 01:32:23,412
How about it?

1008
01:32:24,443 --> 01:32:25,527
It's done.

1009
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,752
<i>She's sure... pushy.</i>

1010
01:32:29,915 --> 01:32:33,367
<i>She's scarier than my own mom.</i>

1011
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:36,801
Pretty good, huh?

1012
01:32:38,636 --> 01:32:39,595
<i>But well...</i>

1013
01:32:40,513 --> 01:32:43,724
<i>I just have to be grateful
for this time... huh?</i>

1014
01:33:04,287 --> 01:33:05,288
I'll do it.

1015
01:33:08,374 --> 01:33:11,043
No! Please back me up.

1016
01:33:16,752 --> 01:33:18,499
I got sand in my mouth...

1017
01:33:19,076 --> 01:33:20,995
P-Please let me go!

1018
01:33:26,753 --> 01:33:29,214
You wouldn't be able to do
anything in your current state...

1019
01:33:30,438 --> 01:33:31,397
I'll do it.

1020
01:33:32,064 --> 01:33:33,608
Gaara of the Desert...

1021
01:33:37,069 --> 01:33:39,822
You use sand,
as the name implies, huh...?

1022
01:33:49,790 --> 01:33:52,168
<i>Tough defense using sand...</i>

1023
01:33:53,669 --> 01:33:57,173
<i>He... isn't a close-range combat type...</i>

1024
01:33:58,591 --> 01:34:01,344
<i>Getting close would be difficult, huh.</i>

1025
01:34:09,977 --> 01:34:10,936
<i>Ten-Finger Drilling Bullets!</i>

1026
01:34:17,443 --> 01:34:18,736
<i>Attack and defense are one...</i>

1027
01:34:19,070 --> 01:34:21,364
<i>He attacks and defends
with sand, huh?</i>

1028
01:34:22,948 --> 01:34:26,243
<i>However, the amount of sand
he can control is probably...</i>

1029
01:34:27,244 --> 01:34:29,288
<i>... about the amount of sand
inside that gourd.</i>

1030
01:34:31,290 --> 01:34:33,851
<i>Going to the trouble of walking around
carrying heavy sand</i>

1031
01:34:33,876 --> 01:34:35,170
<i>is the very proof of that.</i>

1032
01:34:40,383 --> 01:34:41,717
<i>Sand Shower...</i>

1033
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:44,303
How trite...

1034
01:34:46,555 --> 01:34:50,935
It's easy for me to create sand
from the earth...

1035
01:34:52,269 --> 01:34:53,145
<i>I get it...</i>

1036
01:34:53,646 --> 01:34:57,525
<i>With his own sand, he grinds rocks
and minerals in the earth</i>

1037
01:34:57,650 --> 01:34:58,901
<i>and makes it into sand.</i>

1038
01:34:59,610 --> 01:35:02,446
<i>So he was sending his own sand
beneath the ground</i>

1039
01:35:02,670 --> 01:35:05,297
<i>and adding new sand, huh...?</i>

1040
01:35:06,409 --> 01:35:07,827
<i>Gaara of the Desert...</i>

1041
01:35:08,369 --> 01:35:10,621
<i>His nickname isn't just for display.</i>

1042
01:35:11,205 --> 01:35:12,206
<i>Excellent!</i>

1043
01:35:17,169 --> 01:35:18,003
You did it!

1044
01:35:18,129 --> 01:35:19,046
Not yet.

1045
01:35:20,506 --> 01:35:22,717
<i>Sand Burial!</i>

1046
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:42,403
N-No way...

1047
01:35:49,785 --> 01:35:51,746
That's quite some pressure...

1048
01:35:54,498 --> 01:35:57,309
I would've been crushed flat

1049
01:35:57,334 --> 01:36:00,463
if I hadn't made a membrane of
bone just below the skin.

1050
01:36:00,838 --> 01:36:04,049
Bones... That guy's a monster, too.

1051
01:36:04,592 --> 01:36:06,343
It's a troublesome body, isn't it?

1052
01:36:08,679 --> 01:36:10,222
I underestimated you...

1053
01:36:10,514 --> 01:36:13,392
But, I won't be caught by
your sand anymore.

1054
01:36:16,854 --> 01:36:19,356
<i>Sand Tsunami!</i>

1055
01:36:49,386 --> 01:36:51,472
<i>To think it would change
the terrain itself...</i>

1056
01:37:03,818 --> 01:37:05,694
<i>Giant Sand Burial!</i>

1057
01:37:14,954 --> 01:37:16,914
<i>H-He's so strong...</i>

1058
01:37:17,498 --> 01:37:20,584
<i>He's gotten even stronger
than when he fought me.</i>

1059
01:37:22,878 --> 01:37:25,047
But... this time for sure...

1060
01:37:26,674 --> 01:37:28,092
He's a persistent guy...

1061
01:37:28,342 --> 01:37:29,051
Huh?!

1062
01:37:34,172 --> 01:37:35,966
<i>I'm still... alive...</i>

1063
01:37:36,833 --> 01:37:40,712
<i>Then... There's still a reason
for me to live.</i>

1064
01:37:45,454 --> 01:37:46,914
From now, we're going
to launch a night attack

1065
01:37:46,944 --> 01:37:48,237
on the Hidden Mist Village...

1066
01:37:48,769 --> 01:37:51,521
They're still in disarray
from that incident,

1067
01:37:51,634 --> 01:37:55,179
now is the perfect time for us
to make them realize our ferocity!

1068
01:37:59,707 --> 01:38:05,004
Make them realize the ferocity
of the Kaguya Clan!

1069
01:38:05,170 --> 01:38:06,797
- Yeah!
- Right!

1070
01:38:07,965 --> 01:38:11,343
What are you doing, Kimimaro?
Get going!

1071
01:38:12,469 --> 01:38:13,721
I don't know what to do...

1072
01:38:14,638 --> 01:38:16,640
You don't need to think
deeply about it.

1073
01:38:17,174 --> 01:38:19,009
Go down to the Hidden Mist Village

1074
01:38:19,034 --> 01:38:21,245
and kill every last person
you encounter!

1075
01:38:24,481 --> 01:38:28,277
Just act on your instincts!

1076
01:38:36,118 --> 01:38:37,453
Are you of the Hidden Mist Village?

1077
01:38:43,626 --> 01:38:44,543
No...

1078
01:38:47,671 --> 01:38:49,882
I-I see... Excuse me!

1079
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:57,348
Haku?

1080
01:38:57,473 --> 01:39:01,018
Oh... no. It's nothing, Zabuza-san.

1081
01:39:01,518 --> 01:39:04,271
We don't have time to be stopping.
Let's hurry!

1082
01:39:05,397 --> 01:39:06,190
Right!

1083
01:39:10,694 --> 01:39:12,404
<i>He had the same eyes as I do...</i>

1084
01:39:13,113 --> 01:39:15,115
<i>Before I met Zabuza-san...</i>

1085
01:39:31,053 --> 01:39:32,221
Hold it!

1086
01:39:35,219 --> 01:39:39,848
You're a hasty one, aren't you?
I'm not from this village.

1087
01:39:47,231 --> 01:39:50,693
What you seek is over there...

1088
01:39:51,026 --> 01:39:52,778
Now, go.

1089
01:39:58,242 --> 01:39:59,952
<i>It seems to have begun...</i>

1090
01:40:01,704 --> 01:40:03,288
<i>The Kaguya Clan...</i>

1091
01:40:03,914 --> 01:40:09,378
<i>Fools who can only find
their own path of life by fighting...</i>

1092
01:40:10,087 --> 01:40:11,522
<i>It was long ago</i>

1093
01:40:11,547 --> 01:40:15,217
<i>when a simple-minded clan that only
enjoyed slaughter was acceptable.</i>

1094
01:40:15,771 --> 01:40:17,814
<i>When facing an organized force,</i>

1095
01:40:17,886 --> 01:40:19,930
<i>they just become fools
rushing towards death</i>

1096
01:40:20,060 --> 01:40:23,063
<i>that fight only with power...</i>

1097
01:40:39,616 --> 01:40:41,618
<i>Again, I'm all alone...</i>

1098
01:40:55,632 --> 01:40:57,926
Why are you blooming
in a place like this?

1099
01:41:00,471 --> 01:41:02,306
Why won't you answer?

1100
01:41:05,642 --> 01:41:07,811
You're ignoring me, too, huh?!

1101
01:41:08,967 --> 01:41:12,779
There's no way you'd be seen
by someone in a place like this, yet you...

1102
01:41:13,181 --> 01:41:14,241
That's enough...

1103
01:41:17,142 --> 01:41:21,396
Maybe... there's no meaning to living.

1104
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:26,248
But you might be able to
discover something interesting

1105
01:41:26,412 --> 01:41:29,207
by continuing to live... right?

1106
01:41:30,747 --> 01:41:34,084
Like how you discovered that flower...

1107
01:41:34,489 --> 01:41:37,534
Like how I discovered you.

1108
01:41:41,887 --> 01:41:44,098
Okay, let's go...

1109
01:41:49,431 --> 01:41:51,141
<i>The mission for me...</i>

1110
01:41:53,011 --> 01:41:56,973
<i>is to protect Lord Orochimaru
and his ambition.</i>

1111
01:41:59,822 --> 01:42:01,365
What's... that?!

1112
01:42:31,770 --> 01:42:32,813
That form...?!

1113
01:42:48,855 --> 01:42:53,318
So that's the extent of your
rumored Absolute Defense?

1114
01:42:53,667 --> 01:42:55,002
How disappointing.

1115
01:43:01,016 --> 01:43:04,227
I see... You were wearing sand.

1116
01:43:05,020 --> 01:43:06,646
Your opponent's not just him!

1117
01:43:21,924 --> 01:43:23,217
<i>That attack just now...</i>

1118
01:43:23,295 --> 01:43:26,548
<i>It would've been dangerous
had I not been protected by sand.</i>

1119
01:43:28,738 --> 01:43:31,187
<i>M-My body is still...</i>

1120
01:43:32,998 --> 01:43:35,709
<i>I'll just be a hindrance like this.</i>

1121
01:43:39,022 --> 01:43:40,816
Annoying sand...

1122
01:43:41,790 --> 01:43:44,292
You're first, Gaara.

1123
01:43:55,979 --> 01:43:58,190
<i>He yanked out his spinal column?!</i>

1124
01:44:04,613 --> 01:44:06,573
<i>Dance of the Clematis...</i>

1125
01:44:06,865 --> 01:44:07,699
<i>Vine!</i>

1126
01:44:15,791 --> 01:44:16,750
<i>Flower!</i>

1127
01:44:23,131 --> 01:44:25,133
A bone of the strongest calcification...

1128
01:44:27,009 --> 01:44:31,221
It will pierce you,
sand defense and all...

1129
01:44:32,808 --> 01:44:34,059
<i>No time... huh?</i>

1130
01:44:58,460 --> 01:44:59,378
It's hard...

1131
01:45:00,028 --> 01:45:03,115
I gathered the hardest minerals
from the earth,

1132
01:45:04,011 --> 01:45:07,848
applied pressure with chakra
and mixed them into the sand.

1133
01:45:10,595 --> 01:45:14,349
You... that unusual jutsu...

1134
01:45:15,128 --> 01:45:16,838
It's a Kekkei Genkai, right?

1135
01:45:17,811 --> 01:45:19,271
Yes. From the Kaguya Clan...

1136
01:45:20,539 --> 01:45:24,209
An ability which now
only I possess.

1137
01:45:24,353 --> 01:45:26,564
The last one of your clan, then?

1138
01:45:27,029 --> 01:45:30,949
Well, it'll die out here today.

1139
01:45:31,530 --> 01:45:33,824
Indeed, that might happen.

1140
01:45:34,870 --> 01:45:38,832
Because of my sickness,
my body won't last much longer...

1141
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:43,837
But, the clan will not die out.

1142
01:45:46,798 --> 01:45:49,843
Besides, I'm not alone.

1143
01:45:53,889 --> 01:45:55,599
Did you say, not alone?

1144
01:45:56,016 --> 01:45:56,725
That's right...

1145
01:45:57,601 --> 01:46:01,730
As one who plays a part in
Lord Orochimaru's ambition...

1146
01:46:04,399 --> 01:46:07,569
I will remain inside
Lord Orochimaru's soul...

1147
01:46:07,652 --> 01:46:09,738
for all eternity.

1148
01:46:11,026 --> 01:46:13,612
Orochimaru's brainwashing, huh...?

1149
01:46:15,035 --> 01:46:16,495
You're a pitiful guy.

1150
01:46:25,379 --> 01:46:29,174
<i>I used my big moves too much.
I don't have much chakra.</i>

1151
01:46:29,674 --> 01:46:30,926
<i>This is the last of it.</i>

1152
01:46:44,609 --> 01:46:48,113
I'll sink and confine you
200 meters into the ground.

1153
01:46:48,735 --> 01:46:51,780
By the pressure of the sand
stuck to your body,

1154
01:46:51,863 --> 01:46:54,658
you'll soon be unable to move,
not even a finger...

1155
01:47:12,509 --> 01:47:14,010
<i>Dance...</i>

1156
01:47:15,345 --> 01:47:16,972
<i>of the Seedling Fern!</i>

1157
01:47:35,449 --> 01:47:36,992
Thanks for saving me...

1158
01:47:37,075 --> 01:47:40,871
Being able to do something
like this is very impressive.

1159
01:47:41,163 --> 01:47:44,082
All I did was ride the sand
I was already controlling.

1160
01:47:44,958 --> 01:47:46,835
You just have to know how to use it.

1161
01:47:48,488 --> 01:47:51,492
He was a persistent guy,
but this is the end.

1162
01:47:52,889 --> 01:47:54,911
He won't ever come out again.

1163
01:47:56,011 --> 01:47:56,887
Right...

1164
01:47:59,794 --> 01:48:00,920
I can't go on...

1165
01:48:02,039 --> 01:48:03,080
We're getting off...

1166
01:48:04,186 --> 01:48:06,072
It's not brainwashing!

1167
01:48:07,717 --> 01:48:12,764
That person...
Lord Orochimaru understands me!

1168
01:48:14,154 --> 01:48:17,282
What do you guys know?!

1169
01:48:31,129 --> 01:48:32,422
He's dead...

1170
01:48:36,134 --> 01:48:38,553
Could it be? Has Kimimaro...?

1171
01:48:40,201 --> 01:48:43,539
Kimimaro's fate is of
no consequence now...

1172
01:48:45,644 --> 01:48:49,814
Sasuke... I can hardly wait for him.

1173
01:48:51,066 --> 01:48:54,861
He will come here on his own...

1174
01:48:58,657 --> 01:49:00,742
I would have been done for.

1175
01:49:02,494 --> 01:49:03,828
That's not the case.

1176
01:49:04,699 --> 01:49:06,653
My sensei said it often...

1177
01:49:07,616 --> 01:49:09,473
Luck is also a part of strength.

1178
01:49:10,211 --> 01:49:12,154
That meddlesome sensei of yours?

1179
01:49:12,559 --> 01:49:14,307
He's not meddlesome!

1180
01:49:14,916 --> 01:49:17,293
I'm grateful for you saving me.

1181
01:49:18,004 --> 01:49:21,257
But please don't talk like that
about my sensei!

1182
01:49:23,623 --> 01:49:25,291
You, too...?

1183
01:49:27,771 --> 01:49:31,731
When you feel the honor of
someone you revere has been hurt,

1184
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:34,615
you take it personally
and become enraged.

1185
01:49:35,335 --> 01:49:37,587
The more important the person
you revere is to you,

1186
01:49:37,612 --> 01:49:38,947
the greater the feeling...

1187
01:49:40,490 --> 01:49:43,243
Fighting for the sake of someone
important to you...

1188
01:49:45,495 --> 01:49:50,375
He was also the same
as Naruto Uzumaki...

1189
01:49:52,919 --> 01:49:56,464
But... the person who is important
to oneself

1190
01:49:56,646 --> 01:49:59,149
isn't always a "good person."

1191
01:49:59,281 --> 01:50:00,491
I wonder...

1192
01:50:01,122 --> 01:50:04,918
There's no way someone evil
could be important to anyone.

1193
01:50:04,943 --> 01:50:09,031
No. Even if you know they're evil...

1194
01:50:11,146 --> 01:50:13,231
People cannot overcome loneliness...

1195
01:50:21,489 --> 01:50:22,991
Sasuke!
