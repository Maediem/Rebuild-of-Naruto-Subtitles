1
00:00:01,925 --> 00:00:07,764
Sasuke, Lord Orochimaru has
given us one important task.

2
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:11,886
You will need to die once.

3
00:00:12,468 --> 00:00:14,637
Die once, you said?

4
00:00:15,687 --> 00:00:18,607
Mind Awakening Pills.
Please take these.

5
00:00:20,052 --> 00:00:21,846
And after I die?

6
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,900
You don't need to worry.

7
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,156
That is why we are here.

8
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:32,384
We will use our barrier ninjutsu
to suppress the side effects,

9
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:35,829
to guide you from the brink of death
into a state of suspended animation.

10
00:00:39,451 --> 00:00:42,871
<i>No matter what happens,
I cannot afford to die yet.</i>

11
00:00:43,746 --> 00:00:44,627
I'm in your hands...

12
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,303
– <i>Four Black Mists Formation!</i>
– <i>Four Black Mists Formation!</i>

13
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,634
<i>Black Seal!</i>

14
00:01:07,445 --> 00:01:09,155
All right, we're done with
the first part.

15
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:14,667
<i>You are weak.</i>

16
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,077
<i>D-Damn it!</i>

17
00:02:54,413 --> 00:02:56,791
I see... You've made up your mind, huh?

18
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:57,802
Yes!

19
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,972
I'm doing fitness training
to get ready for the surgery.

20
00:03:01,462 --> 00:03:04,173
I want to return as soon as
I can after the surgery, so...

21
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:07,854
Oww!

22
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:09,480
Ow ow...

23
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:17,405
Lee...

24
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,073
Yes?! What is it?

25
00:03:20,642 --> 00:03:23,645
You won't die
if you give up being a shinobi.

26
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,753
Why are you so fixated
on being a shinobi?

27
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:41,679
Proving that even I can become 
a fine ninja... That's my everything!

28
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:48,030
You might die. Even if you succeed...

29
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:49,829
Even so...

30
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:52,031
<i>I promise you!</i>

31
00:03:53,612 --> 00:03:55,239
That's my dream, so...

32
00:03:59,275 --> 00:04:01,986
<i>Why... do you react so strongly
to the name "Hokage"</i>

33
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,995
<i>Unlike you...</i>

34
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:09,249
<i>I will be the next
Hokage, no matter what!</i>

35
00:04:09,871 --> 00:04:12,957
<i>Because Hokage is my dream!</i>

36
00:04:15,707 --> 00:04:19,044
<i>In this village, promising children
are being brought up.</i>

37
00:04:22,468 --> 00:04:26,806
<i>Sarutobi-sensei... Just as I thought,
you were a wonderful Hokage.</i>

38
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,586
The surgery is in the afternoon.
Get ready!

39
00:04:32,868 --> 00:04:35,245
Let's go, Lee! Are you prepared?!

40
00:04:35,551 --> 00:04:36,235
Yes!

41
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,511
Man, I'm exhausted.

42
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,790
I didn't think this mission
would drag on this long.

43
00:04:58,222 --> 00:05:01,767
I'll go check out the situation.
Let's go, Raido!

44
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:02,990
Right.

45
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,397
Damn. This has sure gotten troublesome.

46
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,190
There's one...

47
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,900
No, two of them.

48
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:20,820
Here they come!

49
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,377
You guys are Orochimaru's...

50
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,045
Judging from the direction
you came from,

51
00:05:37,081 --> 00:05:40,459
it seems you're on your way back
from the Hidden Leaf...

52
00:05:47,753 --> 00:05:49,546
What's in that barrel?

53
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,643
Having two Jonin as opponents...

54
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,480
That's a tough one.

55
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,786
<i>Every one of them
has a Curse Mark...</i>

56
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,372
You refuse to answer?

57
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,858
his isn't going to play out
like your ambush last time.

58
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,919
Shut up, you scum!

59
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,379
Just drop dead!

60
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,174
Orochimaru's toys...

61
00:06:24,428 --> 00:06:26,680
Don't you dare mess with Leaf shinobi.

62
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,439
Those two are really late, aren't they?

63
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,859
What should we do, Shizune?

64
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:44,404
Let's go see!

65
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,071
Right!

66
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:54,622
Shikamaru!

67
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:56,707
What's the matter?

68
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,878
There's a smell of blood nearby.

69
00:07:02,605 --> 00:07:04,190
Wh-What's this?!

70
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,014
Raido! Genma!

71
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:23,985
<i>This isn't good!</i>

72
00:07:46,788 --> 00:07:49,917
<i>Right now, all I can do is provide
emergency first aid...</i>

73
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,429
Shizune...

74
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,308
I'm going to hunt those guys down!

75
00:07:55,985 --> 00:07:56,601
No!

76
00:07:57,099 --> 00:07:58,434
B-But...

77
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:01,835
W-Wait... Iwashi.

78
00:08:04,415 --> 00:08:08,836
The jutsu those guys are using...
it's not something an ordinary shinobi can do.

79
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:14,669
If you pursue them alone,
you'll just get yourself killed.

80
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,956
Genma... don't talk anymore!

81
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:34,013
The other two's scent is mixed
with the five others, including Sasuke...

82
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,767
But the five are moving away
from the smell of the blood!

83
00:08:38,036 --> 00:08:38,809
What should we do?!

84
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:43,189
Just as I thought.
He has guides.

85
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,275
<i>This has really turned into
a pain in the neck.</i>

86
00:08:46,739 --> 00:08:49,491
Let's hurry and go after Sasuke!

87
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,239
Shut up, Naruto!

88
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:55,910
That's for Shikamaru to decide!
Stop acting like the boss!

89
00:08:57,308 --> 00:08:58,120
Shikamaru?

90
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,992
The smell of blood probably means

91
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,502
that a battle occurred somewhere.

92
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:08,839
If we go to that location we should
be able to gather some information...

93
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:13,861
We'll have to be careful
as we near the location,

94
00:09:13,945 --> 00:09:15,655
so we'll have to switch to

95
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:18,128
a reconnaissance formation
and approach cautiously...

96
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,747
While all that's going on

97
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,196
Sasuke will cross
the Land of Fire border!

98
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,023
What are we going to do, Shikamaru?!

99
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,236
All right! Let's pursue Sasuke!

100
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,155
All right! That's what I was waiting for!

101
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:34,740
However...

102
00:09:37,473 --> 00:09:41,991
Since there was a battle,
they'll have their guard up.

103
00:09:42,724 --> 00:09:43,558
They'll certainly be aware

104
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,668
that there might be ninja on their tail.

105
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:48,772
In other words,

106
00:09:49,076 --> 00:09:51,662
the odds are high that
there will be traps or an ambush.

107
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,027
Listen carefully...

108
00:09:55,383 --> 00:09:57,843
From now on, use your eyes
and ears to the fullest!

109
00:09:58,224 --> 00:10:01,770
We need to locate those guys before
we get caught in an ambush!

110
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,605
And if we come across
anything suspicious,

111
00:10:05,785 --> 00:10:08,746
don't just dodge it,
figure out what it means!

112
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:10,651
All right!

113
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:12,044
When we find them,

114
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,780
I'm going to use my new jutsu
to knock them out!

115
00:10:15,446 --> 00:10:16,781
<i>That Naruto...</i>

116
00:10:17,086 --> 00:10:20,008
<i>Each time I see him
he's added a new jutsu to his arsenal.</i>

117
00:10:20,645 --> 00:10:23,774
<i>Damn! Just when I thought
I had caught up with him...</i>

118
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,129
Hey! The enemy's smell is everywhere!

119
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,631
Everybody! Stop!

120
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:36,531
Take a careful look above you.

121
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:41,599
Paper bombs...

122
00:10:42,785 --> 00:10:44,162
And in five other places too!

123
00:10:45,377 --> 00:10:47,546
It's a perimeter barrier formation.

124
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,857
Perimeter barrier?

125
00:10:50,685 --> 00:10:52,561
It's one type of booby trap ninjutsu!

126
00:10:53,859 --> 00:10:57,237
Perimeter-type traps have a time lag
and are activated

127
00:10:57,262 --> 00:11:01,558
when someone enters the designated area.

128
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,580
It's an advanced jutsu...

129
00:11:04,891 --> 00:11:07,202
It was in one of the books that
my father made me read.

130
00:11:09,915 --> 00:11:13,217
Damn! Our only choice
is to make a detour...

131
00:11:15,232 --> 00:11:18,193
Damn! Nothing but traps!

132
00:11:18,364 --> 00:11:21,284
Yeah, but the enemy seems
pressed for time.

133
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,892
The traps have noticeable flaws.

134
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,979
Hey, hey, Naruto!
There's wire at your feet!

135
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:30,768
Don't trip on it!

136
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,650
I know that already!

137
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,236
Wait, Naruto!

138
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,423
<i>Shadow Possession Jutsu...</i>

139
00:11:51,345 --> 00:11:54,469
M-Made it... just in the nick of time.

140
00:11:55,052 --> 00:11:58,096
Naruto! I told you to be careful!

141
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:06,525
I see... One wire is easy to see
because it reflects light.

142
00:12:07,316 --> 00:12:10,903
The other wire has been coated
with a matte green.

143
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,165
So it's very difficult to see
with the naked eye.

144
00:12:15,403 --> 00:12:16,488
It's a double trap, huh.

145
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:19,630
Even though they're in a hurry,

146
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,657
that's a pretty elaborate trap.

147
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,367
Which means that...

148
00:12:24,654 --> 00:12:25,738
They're resting.

149
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,166
They could be injured,
or this itself might be the trap...

150
00:12:32,386 --> 00:12:33,136
<i>Byakugan!</i>

151
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,345
I've found them!

152
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:47,183
All right! All right!
I'll drag Sasuke back without fail!

153
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,810
Naruto! Hate to tell you this,

154
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,646
but I'm going to demonstrate
my new jutsu right here!

155
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:54,865
Me too!

156
00:12:55,889 --> 00:12:57,057
Don't be so hasty.

157
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,006
As soon as preparations for
my strategy are complete...

158
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,865
we'll make direct contact
with the target!

159
00:13:10,393 --> 00:13:15,896
Damn! When we're in a hurry,
having to take a damn break...

160
00:13:17,184 --> 00:13:18,440
It can't be helped.

161
00:13:19,322 --> 00:13:22,492
Fighting in State 2
drains your body drastically.

162
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,220
More than that,

163
00:13:24,245 --> 00:13:27,123
and being immobilized for a while
afterward is an ordeal...

164
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:31,167
We had no choice against
two Jonin-level opponents.

165
00:13:31,831 --> 00:13:34,166
If we'd held back,
we would've been done for.

166
00:13:40,815 --> 00:13:41,441
Kiba...

167
00:13:41,924 --> 00:13:42,884
In that case,

168
00:13:43,205 --> 00:13:45,916
don't mess up the timing
of the smoke bombs.

169
00:13:46,084 --> 00:13:46,686
Got it!

170
00:13:48,032 --> 00:13:48,782
Now then...

171
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,412
we'll split up into two teams.

172
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:51,622
- Right!
- Okay!

173
00:14:23,472 --> 00:14:26,058
It looks like they haven't noticed us yet.

174
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,327
Hey, Sasuke's not around.

175
00:14:33,424 --> 00:14:34,399
It appears that...

176
00:14:35,026 --> 00:14:36,653
He's inside that barrel.

177
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:38,671
Is he dead?!

178
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:43,173
That barrel is secured with barriers.
I can't see through it.

179
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,844
I wouldn't think that the guys
who wanted Sasuke

180
00:14:47,091 --> 00:14:49,735
would kill him that easily.

181
00:14:52,681 --> 00:14:54,289
You might be right about that.

182
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,589
What's this?

183
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,536
I poked the bush for kicks

184
00:15:25,561 --> 00:15:28,064
and out come not even a snake,
just two little bugs.

185
00:15:30,758 --> 00:15:32,844
Hey, wait a minute! Wait!

186
00:15:33,202 --> 00:15:35,162
We didn't come here to fight.

187
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,177
We just came here to negotiate!

188
00:15:38,698 --> 00:15:39,795
Huh, then...

189
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,700
What are they?!

190
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,123
There's no point
to that smoke bomb.

191
00:16:00,556 --> 00:16:02,934
You can't run away from me.

192
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:07,800
It's a nearly invisible string,
thinner and stronger than wire.

193
00:16:08,212 --> 00:16:10,695
I've placed my string all over this area.

194
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,430
Damn.

195
00:16:15,383 --> 00:16:18,971
Those two types of wires
on the trap were on purpose...

196
00:16:19,798 --> 00:16:21,615
It was actually a triple trap.

197
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,234
Damn.

198
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,155
Didn't think they had someone with
that kind of ability in their group...

199
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,492
You will be...!

200
00:16:33,384 --> 00:16:35,636
What's going on...? My body...

201
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,917
Nice! Kiba, Shikamaru!

202
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,379
Shadow Possession Jutsu succeeded!

203
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:49,717
But... so they have someone with
this kind of ability too.

204
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,095
Thanks for getting caught so nicely
in my strategy.

205
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,807
Damn... But...

206
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,144
I have this kind of ability, too.

207
00:17:01,848 --> 00:17:02,933
<i>Where did it come from?</i>

208
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,983
<i>Earth Style Barrier:</i>

209
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,486
<i>Earth Dome Prison!</i>

210
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:23,951
These guys are mine.
I need to feed to recover my strength.

211
00:17:25,361 --> 00:17:27,405
Once you're done eating,
catch up with us,

212
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,047
we're going ahead.

213
00:17:36,325 --> 00:17:37,743
Come quickly.

214
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,477
Let us out! You!

215
00:17:41,572 --> 00:17:43,318
Be quiet, Naruto!

216
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:52,738
<i>Fang Over Fang!</i>

217
00:18:10,805 --> 00:18:12,974
<i>The wall is repairing itself...</i>

218
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:17,596
Hey...

219
00:18:18,082 --> 00:18:19,000
I saw that.

220
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,718
Let us out!

221
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:23,950
<i>Byakugan!</i>

222
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,112
Th-This is...

223
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,697
What is it? What's happening?

224
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:58,428
This is bad.
Our chakra's getting sucked out...

225
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:08,689
Damn... I didn't expect them
to just keep us in this barrier,

226
00:19:09,302 --> 00:19:11,970
but I never predicted
they would drain our chakra either.

227
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:25,194
Man. How dare they!
Let us out of here already!

228
00:19:51,337 --> 00:19:55,091
<i>I feel like my body energy
is being sucked out.</i>

229
00:20:02,877 --> 00:20:05,333
Shikamaru, it won't be good if
we stay in here like this.

230
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,665
<i>It was careless to get caught</i>

231
00:20:08,971 --> 00:20:11,596
<i>before we even figured out
our enemy's powers.</i>

232
00:20:12,472 --> 00:20:14,143
<i>On top of all that... inside here.</i>

233
00:20:18,977 --> 00:20:24,038
Damn! I'm going to make a hole
before all my chakra is gone!

234
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:25,483
Akamaru!

235
00:20:27,929 --> 00:20:29,097
<i>The food pills!</i>

236
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,869
Akamaru!
<i>Ninja Art: Human Beast Mimicry</i>

237
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,790
<i>And for me,
Ninja Art: Beast Human Mimicry</i>

238
00:21:04,148 --> 00:21:05,316
<i>Fang Over Fang!</i>

239
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:14,421
All right! Good going, Kiba.

240
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,817
It's useless...

241
00:21:47,852 --> 00:21:51,317
Damn! It starts to repair itself
the moment it's hit.

242
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,856
Same with the ground.

243
00:22:20,264 --> 00:22:22,766
At this rate, we won't last
another ten minutes.

244
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,594
We'll lose all our chakra
and be totally annihilated...

245
00:22:44,553 --> 00:22:48,008
<i>I can't use the Rasengan, it
requires extremely difficult chakra control</i>

246
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,744
especially in a place like this
that's draining our chakra.

247
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:01,713
Hey, I want you to listen to me!
I want to talk to your leader.

248
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:08,053
We won't go after Sasuke anymore,
so let us out of here!

249
00:23:08,361 --> 00:23:09,137
Hey...

250
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,015
Shikamaru, what are you saying?

251
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:16,359
Pleading for your life,
how interesting...

252
00:23:17,098 --> 00:23:22,270
But you guys are my prey,
I can't let you out.

253
00:23:23,271 --> 00:23:28,198
Then... just let me out by myself.

254
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,748
This battle...

255
00:23:37,076 --> 00:23:38,744
is such a drag.

256
00:23:38,867 --> 00:23:42,412
You! Do you know
what you're saying?

257
00:23:43,618 --> 00:23:46,496
Shut up, Kiba. Just be quiet.

258
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,009
What?!

259
00:23:50,531 --> 00:23:51,865
A split in the group, huh?

260
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,575
Seems like you're the leader, but...

261
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,770
I didn't think you would be
the only one begging for your life!

262
00:24:00,062 --> 00:24:04,733
You really see a human's true nature
when they're pushed to the edge of death.

263
00:24:05,391 --> 00:24:07,170
You're such a lowlife.

264
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:11,575
You're not qualified to be responsible
for the lives of your squad members.

265
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:17,414
To abandon Sasuke and
even betray your own squad...

266
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:19,650
Is that what it means
to be a Chunin of the Leaf?

267
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:24,162
Someone like you deserves to die...
I won't let you out.

268
00:24:24,372 --> 00:24:28,460
Shikamaru! I believed in you,
but now I've lost confidence in you!

269
00:24:28,566 --> 00:24:29,734
Let's take this outside!

270
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,470
Hey, we can't get out!
You fool!

271
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:33,515
That's why we're in this situation!

272
00:24:33,997 --> 00:24:35,124
What do you mean by "fool"?

273
00:24:35,287 --> 00:24:36,491
I'm just speaking the truth, fool!

274
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:37,976
Oh! You said "fool" again!

275
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:40,687
Everybody, be quiet for a second!

276
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,108
Choji?

277
00:25:00,075 --> 00:25:03,710
Neji... I'm sorry, but can you use
the rest of the chakra you have

278
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:08,031
to observe the wall behind you
and the wall behind Choji?

279
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:09,716
Understood.

280
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:12,208
Shikamaru! You be quiet!

281
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:13,261
Naruto!

282
00:25:13,486 --> 00:25:14,988
You still don't understand?!

283
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:18,313
Remember what Shikamaru said
when he gathered everyone!

284
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:25,256
<i>Even I can't just sit back
and slack off.</i>

285
00:25:26,138 --> 00:25:28,932
<i>Because I'm responsible
for your lives.</i>

286
00:25:29,592 --> 00:25:32,887
Choji, don't raise your voice
too much from here.

287
00:25:33,321 --> 00:25:37,992
Kiba, dent that wall
behind Neji and Choji again!

288
00:25:38,464 --> 00:25:39,746
Y-Yeah...

289
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:43,875
<i>Fang Over Fang!</i>

290
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,967
Huh! No matter how hard you try,
it's useless!

291
00:26:16,972 --> 00:26:18,293
<i>Huh, I see...</i>

292
00:26:18,605 --> 00:26:19,731
<i>It's over there.</i>

293
00:26:22,949 --> 00:26:23,665
Neji...

294
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,169
Mark that spot with the kunai.

295
00:26:27,618 --> 00:26:29,963
Choji, are you ready?!

296
00:26:30,785 --> 00:26:32,746
Okay! Any time!

297
00:26:32,972 --> 00:26:35,287
All right, let's do this.

298
00:26:35,556 --> 00:26:37,474
What's happening?!

299
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:42,726
As I said earlier,
the wall's surface is infused with chakra.

300
00:26:43,857 --> 00:26:49,958
But even this tough wall could have
an area with a thinner layer of chakra.

301
00:26:50,271 --> 00:26:52,527
That is what Shikamaru speculated.

302
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:56,823
How... How did you figure all that out?

303
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,659
Think about what happened earlier.

304
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:04,222
He noticed that
some areas repaired themselves quickly

305
00:27:04,347 --> 00:27:07,225
and others more slowly,

306
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,331
when Kiba and Akamaru attacked the wall.

307
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:17,068
In other words, he guessed that
the areas that didn't repair quickly

308
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:18,637
probably have a thinner layer of chakra.

309
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:24,559
On top of all that,
by cleverly talking to the enemy,

310
00:27:24,584 --> 00:27:28,588
he figured out the position
of the enemy outside the wall.

311
00:27:31,112 --> 00:27:34,919
He guessed that
the wall furthest from the enemy

312
00:27:35,632 --> 00:27:38,614
probably had the thinnest chakra
reinforcement,

313
00:27:38,639 --> 00:27:41,058
so that's what he wanted to confirm.

314
00:27:42,741 --> 00:27:43,932
That's what it is, correct?

315
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:51,745
<i>I see, in order to trick the enemy,
you must trick your friends first.</i>

316
00:27:52,053 --> 00:27:55,791
<i>I didn't see that there was
such a plan behind that conversation.</i>

317
00:27:56,423 --> 00:27:58,034
I'm depending on you, Choji.

318
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,043
Yeah!

319
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:02,972
<i>Expansion Jutsu!</i>

320
00:28:04,066 --> 00:28:06,402
All right, let's go!

321
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,819
<i>Human Boulder!</i>

322
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,218
What?!

323
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:06,202
Choji... You are awesome, after all!

324
00:29:18,897 --> 00:29:21,390
Everybody, you did well...

325
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,122
for some losers.

326
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:26,156
What?!

327
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,682
Who are you calling losers?!

328
00:29:29,942 --> 00:29:32,030
Once we're out, we'll win this fight!

329
00:29:32,055 --> 00:29:34,197
I will do it!

330
00:29:34,493 --> 00:29:35,660
Wait, you two!

331
00:29:38,052 --> 00:29:40,554
It's dangerous to fight him
head-on right now!

332
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:43,865
We tore through the barrier!
We can do this!

333
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:53,249
<i>Earth Style: Sphere of Graves!</i>

334
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:54,501
He's nuts!

335
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,270
You are the squad leader,
if I'm not mistaken.

336
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,733
You sure do suffer
when you have a stupid leader.

337
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:20,568
You underlings!

338
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,572
A stupid leader like this...

339
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,574
I'll get rid of him for you!

340
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:29,661
<i>Expansion Jutsu! Human Boulder!</i>

341
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,165
Thanks! Choji...

342
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:38,082
Why? Wasting my good intentions...

343
00:30:43,088 --> 00:30:47,250
If the leader is stupid,
then I guess the subordinates are losers.

344
00:30:49,011 --> 00:30:53,765
Well... I'll kill you losers
before you suffer

345
00:30:54,202 --> 00:30:57,241
working under a gloomy shadow-user
like him!

346
00:30:57,622 --> 00:31:00,041
Damn, damn! Babbling on like that!

347
00:31:00,384 --> 00:31:01,751
I will!

348
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:02,610
He's mine!

349
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:07,198
I will... take care of him!

350
00:31:10,397 --> 00:31:11,231
Choji...

351
00:31:11,608 --> 00:31:12,817
What are you saying?!

352
00:31:12,981 --> 00:31:15,442
He's not the kind of guy
you can handle on your own!

353
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,041
I will do it!

354
00:31:17,544 --> 00:31:19,463
Choji... you...

355
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:27,802
Shikamaru...
Take these food pills for everyone...

356
00:31:29,014 --> 00:31:31,308
Choji... Don't tell me you're going to...

357
00:31:32,334 --> 00:31:35,504
That's right.
I have that secret weapon of mine.

358
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,979
But Choji, those are...!

359
00:31:41,008 --> 00:31:44,845
Huh... Losers, I won't let you
have your way!

360
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:45,697
He's coming!

361
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:48,907
I'll get rid of you all here!

362
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:51,801
Go, everyone!

363
00:31:55,865 --> 00:31:58,868
<i>The Tri-Colored Pills?
Those aren't food pills.</i>

364
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,293
<i>What are they?</i>

365
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,962
<i>First... the Green Pill!</i>

366
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,340
Get out of the way! Loser!

367
00:32:10,294 --> 00:32:13,255
<i>Impossible... He stopped me?!</i>

368
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,935
Shikamaru, take everyone and go!

369
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,144
Choji...

370
00:32:18,672 --> 00:32:21,842
What did we form this team for?

371
00:32:22,491 --> 00:32:27,621
If we lose Sasuke,
then we will end up like he said...

372
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:31,699
The stupid leader and his losers!

373
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,750
You better catch up with us, Choji!

374
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:41,626
Yeah.

375
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:44,462
Everybody, go!

376
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,464
All right! Let's go, everyone!

377
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:47,799
- Yeah!
- Right!

378
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,639
<i>Choji...</i>

379
00:32:56,349 --> 00:33:00,812
I'm going to get rid of you quickly,
and then get rid of those guys too!

380
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,815
It won't be that easy...

381
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:20,289
<i>What?!</i>

382
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:34,303
I will...

383
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:40,560
... stop you!

384
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,161
A parting gift from Choji...
Eat it!

385
00:33:58,388 --> 00:33:58,964
Yeah!

386
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,258
Thanks, Choji...

387
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:04,625
Kiba!

388
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:06,627
Thanks!

389
00:34:07,487 --> 00:34:11,121
Shikamaru...
That pill that Choji took earlier...

390
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:13,706
It seemed like some sort
of trump card,

391
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:15,831
but does he have a chance to win?

392
00:34:16,787 --> 00:34:19,390
He said that he has a secret weapon.

393
00:34:20,181 --> 00:34:26,189
He brought the Akimichi clan's
ultimate secret pills on this mission...

394
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,902
These are the Tri-Colored Pills:
green, yellow, and red.

395
00:34:31,034 --> 00:34:34,037
If you take them,
you can gain explosive power.

396
00:34:35,314 --> 00:34:39,652
The energy that each pill
contains is enormous!

397
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:43,709
I see! I see!
So that's why he was so confident!

398
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:49,045
<i>But... there's always a side effect
to any pills that work too well.</i>

399
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:59,348
<i>Damn... I didn't think it would hurt
so much with just the Green Pill.</i>

400
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,770
<i>I hope that Choji can settle it
with just the Green Pill.</i>

401
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:09,982
<i>Don't take the red one,
no matter what, Choji.</i>

402
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,986
<i>I'm going to finish you off at once!</i>

403
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,626
<i>Expansion Jutsu!</i>

404
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:40,221
<i>Spiky Human Boulder!</i>

405
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:52,066
<i>He raised the rotational
and destructive power</i>

406
00:35:52,128 --> 00:35:54,046
<i>by using the kunai as spikes.</i>

407
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:02,364
<i>Earth Style: Terra Shield!</i>

408
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,043
What?!

409
00:36:31,446 --> 00:36:33,615
Don't get carried away, loser!

410
00:36:35,661 --> 00:36:37,301
<i>Slamming Palm!</i>

411
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,578
Did you know?

412
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,918
When there's a group of, say, five people,

413
00:36:51,965 --> 00:36:53,967
there's always one loser.

414
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,882
That person is always made fun of...

415
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:00,067
and when it comes down to it,

416
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,615
they'll just toss that person
aside like a pawn.

417
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,682
I'm talking about you!

418
00:37:10,992 --> 00:37:16,456
<i>Choji. All you do is eat.
You should train sometimes, at least!</i>

419
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:22,490
<i>You get teased because you're like that.
You're just a fa—</i>

420
00:37:22,799 --> 00:37:25,218
<i>You said somebody exceptional, right?</i>

421
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,119
<i>Shouldn't we ask Shino or somebody?!</i>

422
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,215
<i>That is true...</i>

423
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,969
<i>No matter how hard I try on my own...</i>

424
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:45,471
<i>I...</i>

425
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,065
Seems like I hit it right on the nose.

426
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:01,195
Seems like the Leaf is lacking in people,

427
00:38:01,443 --> 00:38:04,890
seeing that they picked a loser
like you for the pursuit team.

428
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:09,578
<i>But...</i>

429
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:27,763
<i>Choji and I have worked as a team
for many years,</i>

430
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,891
<i>so coordinating with him
is easiest for me.</i>

431
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,227
<i>But Shikamaru...</i>

432
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:52,770
<i>But, if we fight against each other,
you might be stronger.</i>

433
00:38:53,446 --> 00:38:56,991
<i>I might have given up fighting
against you too.</i>

434
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,837
<i>And you're you...</i>

435
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:03,507
<i>But...</i>

436
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:09,269
<i>Shikamaru... has always...</i>

437
00:39:12,653 --> 00:39:16,401
<i>Shikamaru has always
believed in me...</i>

438
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,940
<i>Choji... are you ready?!</i>

439
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:26,788
<i>He believed that I was really strong!</i>

440
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,270
<i>That's why he entrusted this to me alone!</i>

441
00:39:42,488 --> 00:39:45,199
Oh? Pretty impressive chakra.

442
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:50,206
But... it's a far cry
from being a main dish...

443
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,309
Let's go, fatso!

444
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:58,229
Don't YOU say that!

445
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,981
<i>Partial Expansion Jutsu:</i>

446
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:03,442
<i>Arm!</i>

447
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:11,818
<i>Partial Expansion Jutsu:</i>

448
00:40:14,418 --> 00:40:15,336
<i>Leg!</i>

449
00:40:16,522 --> 00:40:18,107
<i>Partial Expansion Jutsu:</i>

450
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:18,753
<i>Arm!</i>

451
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:36,392
Don't mess with me! Scum!

452
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:40,688
Eat this!

453
00:40:40,884 --> 00:40:41,510
What?!

454
00:40:41,678 --> 00:40:44,029
<i>Super Expansion Jutsu!</i>

455
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:00,309
<i>I did it... Shikamaru...</i>

456
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:03,836
<i>What?!</i>

457
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:11,010
I can't believe I had to go to
State 2

458
00:41:11,061 --> 00:41:13,814
for an opponent like this one...

459
00:41:17,936 --> 00:41:19,604
<i>Slamming Palm</i>

460
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,124
<i>What... What is that appearance?!</i>

461
00:41:42,869 --> 00:41:45,163
Now that it's come to this, it's over.

462
00:41:45,722 --> 00:41:49,726
In State 2, I can put out ten times
more power than before.

463
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,156
I'm invincible.

464
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,478
<i>It's too painful to move...</i>

465
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:05,981
<i>Who knew that the side effects
of the Yellow Pill would be this intense.</i>

466
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:12,738
This is what happens...

467
00:42:13,579 --> 00:42:16,465
to powerless scum for butting in!

468
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:25,086
Go back to just playing ninja!

469
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:35,261
Because he... promised...

470
00:42:36,426 --> 00:42:41,976
He's definitely going to defeat
the opponent and come after us!

471
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:44,019
Yep!

472
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:47,886
That's right... he can do it.

473
00:42:50,245 --> 00:42:52,236
Okay! While I'm here...

474
00:42:53,448 --> 00:42:55,074
Me too...

475
00:42:59,332 --> 00:43:00,661
All right, everyone,

476
00:43:00,783 --> 00:43:03,496
we get Sasuke back
before Choji catches up!

477
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:06,000
Wait!

478
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:09,545
All right! Here we come!

479
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,926
He's late... that Jirobo...

480
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:18,721
He's greedy and eats so much...

481
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:21,932
He's probably squeezing out chakra
even from the marrow of their bones.

482
00:43:22,328 --> 00:43:24,832
I wish he had switched
with me already...

483
00:43:41,087 --> 00:43:44,716
I need a lot of chakra
for State 2.

484
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:48,917
I'll take whatever chakra
you have left!

485
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:53,213
Well then, I'll take it now.

486
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,347
There's not much left...

487
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,098
You're empty!

488
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:06,894
I haven't had nearly enough to eat...

489
00:44:22,709 --> 00:44:24,885
I said I haven't had enough to eat!

490
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:27,915
Huh?

491
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:31,251
What, just one last piece, huh...

492
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:35,566
When I said I haven't had
enough to eat...

493
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:44,765
Just as I thought, you're the scum
used as a sacrificial pawn.

494
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:50,562
Die... you pitiful fatso,
you're just the leftover.

495
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:54,149
<i>I won't let you play ninja with us!</i>

496
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,151
Why?

497
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:59,365
Because if we let you play,
we'll lose.

498
00:44:59,622 --> 00:45:01,268
You're slow.

499
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:07,788
Yeah, but... then the number
of people won't be even.

500
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:11,250
Japanese chess is fun
because the number of pieces are even.

501
00:45:13,633 --> 00:45:17,212
A useless piece is the same
as not having one at all!

502
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,772
Yeah, that's right!

503
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,471
We're the ones with fewer players,
and we're not complaining.

504
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:25,764
Hurry up, let's do it!

505
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:28,392
If it's okay with you, then it's fine...

506
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:30,142
Okay, it's settled!

507
00:45:30,456 --> 00:45:31,981
We can win it!

508
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:32,604
Yes!

509
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:34,565
Where are we going to hide this time?

510
00:46:11,762 --> 00:46:15,985
And um, the whole Akimichi Clan
is fat and slow...

511
00:46:16,414 --> 00:46:17,996
That's what everyone says.

512
00:46:18,508 --> 00:46:19,551
Really...

513
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:29,077
But Choji, you have a kinder heart
than anyone I know.

514
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:36,668
One day, you'll surely make friends
who'll see that quality of yours.

515
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:42,132
And then you should cherish
those friends

516
00:46:42,386 --> 00:46:44,587
and become a friend they can trust,
just as much as you trust them.

517
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,682
Oh! You...

518
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:54,353
You... were there just now...

519
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,496
What about playing ninja?

520
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,315
It was a drag, so I left.

521
00:46:59,547 --> 00:47:00,047
Huh?

522
00:47:00,458 --> 00:47:03,002
By the way, that's my special seat.

523
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:04,759
Your special seat?

524
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:10,202
I like to lie on my back and
look at the clouds on a nice day like this.

525
00:47:12,161 --> 00:47:13,912
You've come to look at clouds?

526
00:47:15,517 --> 00:47:17,477
Mind if I sit there?

527
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,545
Oh... sure!

528
00:47:23,778 --> 00:47:26,957
This is a good place.
You can see the clouds well.

529
00:47:29,776 --> 00:47:30,389
Yeah...

530
00:47:34,871 --> 00:47:36,061
Why don't you...?

531
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:36,854
What?

532
00:47:38,729 --> 00:47:42,581
Watch the clouds with me
and lounge around?

533
00:47:44,533 --> 00:47:45,279
Okay!

534
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:50,092
You know! I brought snacks.
Want some?

535
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,243
Oh, that'd be great!

536
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,179
Thanks.

537
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:03,254
Eating potato chips
while watching clouds... this is the best.

538
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,381
Yep!

539
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:12,087
My name is Shikamaru...
from the Nara Clan.

540
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,600
You... What's your name?

541
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:19,354
It's Choji! Choji Akimichi
of the Akimichi Clan!

542
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:23,441
Choji, huh...
I think I'll get along with you.

543
00:48:24,502 --> 00:48:25,669
Me, too!

544
00:48:43,046 --> 00:48:47,299
<i>Shikamaru... Sorry... I can't go...</i>

545
00:48:48,423 --> 00:48:50,814
It's over...

546
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,556
<i>But, this guy...</i>

547
00:48:54,927 --> 00:48:57,592
<i>I have to beat him...
even if it means death.</i>

548
00:48:58,316 --> 00:49:00,685
No matter what you do now,
it's too late!

549
00:49:00,969 --> 00:49:02,002
<i>Slamming Palm!</i>

550
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:30,384
<i>Wh-What's that...?</i>

551
00:49:32,113 --> 00:49:32,948
But...

552
00:49:34,023 --> 00:49:35,525
<i>Boulder Slam!</i>

553
00:49:38,332 --> 00:49:39,333
It's no good!

554
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:44,765
I'm 100 times stronger than before!

555
00:49:51,976 --> 00:49:53,144
They say that food
can be a reason

556
00:49:53,169 --> 00:49:55,171
for people to hold a horrible grudge
against someone.

557
00:49:55,492 --> 00:50:01,206
The blow just now...
was for eating my last chip...

558
00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:02,601
<i>No way!</i>

559
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:06,378
<i>This guy has so much chakra that
his body has changed physically!</i>

560
00:50:06,947 --> 00:50:08,532
And this is...

561
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:15,429
for making fun of me by calling me
a sacrificial pawn and fat!

562
00:50:15,848 --> 00:50:19,101
But what I can't forgive you for
more than anything else...

563
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:23,228
You insulted my best friend!

564
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:29,693
More than mocking me
by calling me fat,

565
00:50:30,144 --> 00:50:32,607
and for stealing the last chip
out of the bag...

566
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:35,782
I can't forgive you for that!

567
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:41,580
<i>All of my chakra... to my left hand!</i>

568
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:43,582
<i>This is bad!</i>

569
00:50:43,817 --> 00:50:47,613
This blow... is heavier than my life!

570
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:51,131
W-Wait! Don't be hasty!

571
00:51:33,763 --> 00:51:34,883
I... I won.

572
00:51:36,069 --> 00:51:38,349
<i>Me... I won!</i>

573
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:04,371
<i>Everyone...</i>

574
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:08,247
<i>Dad...</i>

575
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:13,163
<i>I've made... a lot of friends...</i>

576
00:54:01,646 --> 00:54:02,381
What's wrong?

577
00:54:10,006 --> 00:54:11,092
It's close.

578
00:54:22,935 --> 00:54:23,978
That's strange.

579
00:54:25,338 --> 00:54:27,841
There hasn't been even
one trap set for a while...

580
00:54:29,023 --> 00:54:31,025
Shikamaru, what do you think?

581
00:54:33,112 --> 00:54:35,615
We're being underestimated.

582
00:54:36,302 --> 00:54:40,962
They think the only one
following them is that big guy.

583
00:54:42,096 --> 00:54:44,693
They don't need to set
traps for one of their own.

584
00:54:44,914 --> 00:54:47,819
How dare they underestimate us!

585
00:54:48,661 --> 00:54:50,537
It seems you're right.

586
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:54,228
We are being
completely underestimated.

587
00:54:55,794 --> 00:54:58,496
However, this is our chance.

588
00:54:59,347 --> 00:55:02,511
Yeah... We'll take them by surprise.

589
00:55:09,107 --> 00:55:10,914
That Jirobo is late.

590
00:55:11,856 --> 00:55:13,967
No, he's already here.

591
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:22,773
Aw, c'mon, what took you so long?

592
00:55:24,038 --> 00:55:25,003
Sorry.

593
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:29,257
It took time to eat those scum's chakra.

594
00:55:31,637 --> 00:55:34,687
Hey fatso, don't drag your feet!

595
00:55:35,758 --> 00:55:37,771
Hurry up and carry that coffin...

596
00:55:38,108 --> 00:55:41,926
That's your job, you foul-mouthed woman.

597
00:55:42,515 --> 00:55:43,146
I know.

598
00:55:48,315 --> 00:55:52,445
What, Jirobo...
You're awfully easygoing today.

599
00:55:53,709 --> 00:55:54,682
What do you mean?

600
00:55:56,237 --> 00:55:59,704
I'm just saying I'm not handing you
the coffin.

601
00:56:00,098 --> 00:56:02,482
Because you're not Jirobo!

602
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:12,795
This time let me do it.

603
00:56:13,228 --> 00:56:16,032
Sakon, Tayuya, you guys go ahead!

604
00:56:22,555 --> 00:56:26,565
Jirobo always corrects
Tayuya's choice of words.

605
00:56:30,668 --> 00:56:32,457
Heh, I see.

606
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:35,746
<i>Ninja Art: Spider Web Net</i>

607
00:56:43,576 --> 00:56:45,570
You!

608
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,308
<i>Ninja Art: Spiral Spider Web</i>

609
00:56:58,341 --> 00:56:59,180
<i>Fang Over Fang!</i>

610
00:57:06,621 --> 00:57:07,775
I won't let you get away!

611
00:57:10,269 --> 00:57:12,055
That's my line.

612
00:57:13,157 --> 00:57:14,372
Look at your feet.

613
00:57:17,777 --> 00:57:18,722
You!

614
00:57:19,195 --> 00:57:21,942
It's way too early to think you've got us
trapped with something like this!

615
00:57:23,304 --> 00:57:24,149
Shut up!

616
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:30,658
<i>Got it.</i>

617
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:41,692
- Neji!
- What?!

618
00:57:43,365 --> 00:57:45,563
<i>Me, Naruto, Kiba and Neji...</i>

619
00:57:45,981 --> 00:57:48,202
<i>Even though we've followed the plan,
it's no good.</i>

620
00:58:04,381 --> 00:58:06,942
I'm going to cocoon you.

621
00:58:12,832 --> 00:58:13,885
Damn!

622
00:58:18,425 --> 00:58:20,386
Damn it! Damn it!

623
00:58:20,878 --> 00:58:23,725
What's with this thread?! It won't cut.

624
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,064
It's useless.

625
00:58:26,595 --> 00:58:29,651
My thread is so strong that
even if two elephants pulled at it,

626
00:58:29,904 --> 00:58:31,583
it wouldn't break.

627
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,076
Shadow Clone... Interesting.

628
00:58:50,619 --> 00:58:52,173
<i>This thread is sticky...</i>

629
00:58:53,122 --> 00:58:55,599
<i>This stickiness is probably made</i>

630
00:58:55,624 --> 00:58:59,097
<i>by mixing chakra with
his special body fluid.</i>

631
00:58:59,971 --> 00:59:03,568
<i>Moreover, this strength. Even after
it's been released from his hands...</i>

632
00:59:04,055 --> 00:59:07,194
<i>chakra's continuously flowing
in the thread.</i>

633
00:59:09,138 --> 00:59:14,362
<i>It's impossible...
The level of this jutsu is incredible.</i>

634
00:59:16,483 --> 00:59:19,246
<i>Calm down... Just calm down...</i>

635
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:22,162
<i>My chakra...</i>

636
00:59:38,501 --> 00:59:40,147
<i>Ninja Art: Spider Sticky Gold</i>

637
00:59:41,973 --> 00:59:44,361
<i>It's a different color than
the thread from before.</i>

638
00:59:45,466 --> 00:59:46,520
<i>What's he going to do?</i>

639
00:59:57,436 --> 00:59:59,449
<i>It's quickly solidifying, huh...</i>

640
01:00:02,358 --> 01:00:05,273
You are the first one,
so it's like a little entertainment.

641
01:00:05,903 --> 01:00:09,792
Now I'll play a game to see
which of you is the real one.

642
01:00:10,074 --> 01:00:11,336
What did you say?!

643
01:00:12,993 --> 01:00:16,135
First is... you at the end.

644
01:00:22,614 --> 01:00:24,251
What a lucky guy.

645
01:00:24,952 --> 01:00:29,008
Next, I'll take two at once.
The odds are now two to one.

646
01:00:40,563 --> 01:00:45,411
This guy's really lucky,
but it's one of these two now!

647
01:00:54,118 --> 01:00:56,218
Turns out he made it to the last.

648
01:00:57,346 --> 01:01:03,488
Well, it was fun as a game,
but now the game's over.

649
01:01:08,109 --> 01:01:08,739
Die!

650
01:01:11,177 --> 01:01:12,814
The first one is done.

651
01:01:14,813 --> 01:01:15,392
What?!

652
01:01:26,817 --> 01:01:30,498
<i>I see, the real body made
its shadow clones get caught,</i>

653
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:33,825
<i>and hid himself and
waited for a chance, huh.</i>

654
01:01:35,075 --> 01:01:39,048
<i>For a grunt like him to come up with
such a plan in this situation...</i>

655
01:01:39,637 --> 01:01:42,901
You're not too bad... but...

656
01:01:48,964 --> 01:01:50,685
You're at the end of the line. Die!

657
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:55,189
What?!

658
01:01:56,013 --> 01:01:58,526
Naruto, the time you bought was helpful.

659
01:01:59,183 --> 01:01:59,813
Neji!

660
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:05,290
You... How...?!

661
01:02:08,943 --> 01:02:11,372
Chakra-based substances...

662
01:02:12,488 --> 01:02:14,334
are meaningless against Gentle Fist

663
01:02:14,614 --> 01:02:16,579
which destroys by injecting
chakra directly.

664
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:19,744
That guy's jutsu...

665
01:02:22,248 --> 01:02:25,178
Evidently I'm the only one
who can fight it.

666
01:02:27,692 --> 01:02:28,328
Go!

667
01:02:30,422 --> 01:02:31,434
I'll take care of this.

668
01:02:34,843 --> 01:02:36,481
The reason we're doing this

669
01:02:36,764 --> 01:02:38,944
is because of the mission
to bring back Sasuke.

670
01:02:40,391 --> 01:02:41,736
But that's not all.

671
01:02:42,810 --> 01:02:45,430
What we are after and trying
to protect is the bond

672
01:02:46,266 --> 01:02:48,696
of the shinobi of
the Hidden Leaf Village.

673
01:02:54,369 --> 01:02:58,508
Look, Sasuke is heading
towards Orochimaru.

674
01:02:59,446 --> 01:03:02,418
We can't let Orochimaru get
his hands on someone from our village.

675
01:03:03,998 --> 01:03:04,759
Absolutely not.

676
01:03:07,042 --> 01:03:08,096
And...

677
01:03:22,447 --> 01:03:23,292
Naruto...

678
01:03:25,898 --> 01:03:28,411
Your eyes are better than mine.

679
01:03:34,892 --> 01:03:35,932
Right now, Sasuke is...

680
01:03:39,852 --> 01:03:41,073
in the darkness.

681
01:03:51,795 --> 01:03:55,643
Hurry up and go!
I'll catch up with you!

682
01:03:58,427 --> 01:03:59,057
Mmh!

683
01:04:01,805 --> 01:04:03,526
Okay! Let's go!

684
01:04:04,683 --> 01:04:07,113
You and Choji,
make sure to catch up!

685
01:04:09,021 --> 01:04:09,782
Yeah...

686
01:04:17,196 --> 01:04:19,250
<i>Heh... think I'll let them get away?!</i>

687
01:04:21,742 --> 01:04:22,462
<i>Byakugan!</i>

688
01:04:35,381 --> 01:04:37,602
This guy's pretty good...

689
01:04:41,595 --> 01:04:42,523
Neji!

690
01:04:42,971 --> 01:04:43,983
That's Neji all right!

691
01:04:47,996 --> 01:04:49,174
Well, that's fine.

692
01:04:50,073 --> 01:04:54,046
It seems you're the strongest
out of the lot.

693
01:05:00,269 --> 01:05:03,332
For starters, I'll play with you...
and kill you in three minutes.

694
01:05:41,621 --> 01:05:42,675
I got you.

695
01:05:46,737 --> 01:05:53,379
You're pretty good at handling chakra
and you've got sharp eyes.

696
01:05:54,473 --> 01:05:57,176
You release chakra from
the chakra points in your hands

697
01:05:57,201 --> 01:05:58,936
like a sharp needle.

698
01:05:59,423 --> 01:06:03,813
You see the weak points in the thread
where chakra flows, and attack them.

699
01:06:06,879 --> 01:06:10,695
I see, I've heard from Lord Orochimaru...

700
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:13,386
This is the Gentle Fist, isn't it?

701
01:06:16,148 --> 01:06:19,036
But if you can't use
those annoying hands,

702
01:06:19,429 --> 01:06:21,566
they can't cut my threads either.

703
01:06:24,948 --> 01:06:29,297
Man, games. The instant you know
the rules of engagement,

704
01:06:29,741 --> 01:06:31,878
they're no longer interesting.

705
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:36,956
It's only been a minute,
but I'm already tired of you.

706
01:06:47,179 --> 01:06:48,149
<i>Die!</i>

707
01:06:52,309 --> 01:06:53,736
<i>Ninja Art: Spider Sticky Gold</i>

708
01:07:09,451 --> 01:07:10,081
<i>What?!</i>

709
01:07:22,256 --> 01:07:23,726
<i>How did he...?!</i>

710
01:07:25,049 --> 01:07:27,354
I'll explain, especially for you.

711
01:07:28,595 --> 01:07:29,899
It's not just my hands

712
01:07:31,473 --> 01:07:35,071
I can release chakra from
all the chakra points on my body.

713
01:07:36,979 --> 01:07:40,409
And it's game over.

714
01:07:44,444 --> 01:07:49,043
<i>Gentle Fist: 8 Trigrams, 64 Palms!</i>

715
01:07:50,534 --> 01:07:51,170
<i>Uh oh!</i>

716
01:07:54,705 --> 01:07:55,675
2 Palms!

717
01:08:00,711 --> 01:08:01,341
4 Palms!

718
01:08:03,338 --> 01:08:03,968
8 Palms!

719
01:08:05,507 --> 01:08:06,268
16 Palms!

720
01:08:07,676 --> 01:08:08,354
32 Palms!

721
01:08:11,179 --> 01:08:12,108
64 Palms!

722
01:08:34,691 --> 01:08:36,039
<i>What's going on?!</i>

723
01:08:44,504 --> 01:08:46,267
A golden surface on his body...?

724
01:09:11,453 --> 01:09:14,342
<i>It's the same material as the weapon
he spit out of his mouth earlier...</i>

725
01:09:16,954 --> 01:09:18,340
That was close.

726
01:09:19,164 --> 01:09:21,051
I hear that if you're hit straight on
with Gentle Fist,

727
01:09:21,333 --> 01:09:22,553
your chakra network gets damaged

728
01:09:22,834 --> 01:09:24,638
and you become unable
to build up chakra...

729
01:09:25,504 --> 01:09:26,474
That was close.

730
01:09:29,132 --> 01:09:30,227
Are you a monster?

731
01:09:31,551 --> 01:09:33,481
It seems to come
not just from your mouth.

732
01:09:35,764 --> 01:09:37,231
Gum Style Spider Thread...

733
01:09:37,805 --> 01:09:41,027
is a metal that hardens
the instant it leaves my body.

734
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,699
Moreover, it doesn't let chakra through.

735
01:09:44,690 --> 01:09:49,538
And... it can be secreted
not just from my mouth,

736
01:09:50,042 --> 01:09:52,930
but also from the sweat glands
throughout my body.

737
01:10:02,541 --> 01:10:07,223
<i>Attacks on chakra points won't work.
Now it makes sense...</i>

738
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:10,226
<i>The Spider Web Net won't work
on him up close.</i>

739
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:13,763
<i>And there'll be no close range
combat against the Gentle Fist.</i>

740
01:10:14,428 --> 01:10:15,397
<i>In other words,</i>

741
01:10:15,770 --> 01:10:18,617
<i>I just have to attack the blind side
from long distance.</i>

742
01:11:03,810 --> 01:11:04,697
<i>The kunai is a fake!</i>

743
01:11:09,232 --> 01:11:10,244
<i>8 Trigrams, Palm...</i>

744
01:11:11,318 --> 01:11:11,996
<i>Rotation!</i>

745
01:11:22,179 --> 01:11:24,358
<i>Wha—?! What is that?!</i>

746
01:11:33,632 --> 01:11:37,146
<i>Does he... have eyes behind him?!</i>

747
01:11:39,086 --> 01:11:41,223
<i>And the defense just now...</i>

748
01:11:41,956 --> 01:11:44,594
<i>He repelled physical attacks
with chakra?!</i>

749
01:11:56,084 --> 01:11:57,471
<i>Can he see me?!</i>

750
01:11:59,866 --> 01:12:01,545
<i>What the hell is he?!</i>

751
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:05,791
I know you're there.

752
01:12:07,229 --> 01:12:07,990
Come out.

753
01:12:09,448 --> 01:12:10,459
<i>Those eyes...</i>

754
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:14,313
<i>It seems they can do more
than just see chakra flow...</i>

755
01:12:15,657 --> 01:12:18,170
<i>So he's an extraordinary
visual jutsu user...</i>

756
01:12:19,923 --> 01:12:21,794
<i>A long range battle
is unfavorable...</i>

757
01:12:22,808 --> 01:12:25,488
<i>I must bring this to
close combat by all means.</i>

758
01:12:26,583 --> 01:12:27,428
Very well.

759
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:37,826
I'll acknowledge that this game has
a somewhat high level of difficulty!

760
01:12:39,322 --> 01:12:41,293
I'm going to get serious now.

761
01:12:45,328 --> 01:12:47,591
<i>It's like he's a totally different person
from before...</i>

762
01:12:48,498 --> 01:12:50,386
<i>His chakra activity is overwhelming.</i>

763
01:12:52,294 --> 01:12:54,348
<i>And those markings...</i>

764
01:13:02,061 --> 01:13:03,740
<i>His move earlier...</i>

765
01:13:04,063 --> 01:13:05,909
<i>He dodged an attack aimed
from behind</i>

766
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:08,419
<i>and was able to see me hiding
in the shadows.</i>

767
01:13:10,103 --> 01:13:11,608
<i>In other words,</i>

768
01:13:12,082 --> 01:13:14,539
<i>he has a combined wide range
of sight and X-ray vision.</i>

769
01:13:15,692 --> 01:13:17,955
<i>And what's more, that jutsu...</i>

770
01:13:18,905 --> 01:13:19,958
<i>If so...</i>

771
01:13:24,572 --> 01:13:25,733
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

772
01:13:41,053 --> 01:13:43,524
<i>If he defends
against physical attacks</i>

773
01:13:43,731 --> 01:13:46,768
<i>with a large emission
of chakra and its Rotation...</i>

774
01:13:47,396 --> 01:13:50,722
<i>all I need to do then is to stop
that chakra Rotation!</i>

775
01:13:53,299 --> 01:13:53,950
Scatter!

776
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,003
<i>Rotation!</i>

777
01:14:15,877 --> 01:14:17,264
<i>It's starting to stop.</i>

778
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:23,020
<i>Here!</i>

779
01:14:25,645 --> 01:14:26,260
Die!

780
01:14:39,167 --> 01:14:42,514
<i>He released chakra just in time
and repelled the kunai!</i>

781
01:14:46,305 --> 01:14:47,601
<i>To think he'd stop my chakra Rotation</i>

782
01:14:47,904 --> 01:14:49,831
<i>by binding it with chakra threads...</i>

783
01:14:50,996 --> 01:14:52,091
<i>These things...</i>

784
01:14:53,416 --> 01:14:54,553
<i>I just have to cut them for now.</i>

785
01:14:57,599 --> 01:14:58,986
<i>If the Rotation doesn't work,</i>

786
01:14:59,251 --> 01:15:00,888
<i>then I'll just have to dodge
them all.</i>

787
01:15:03,008 --> 01:15:05,604
<i>This guy uses
close range taijutsu style combat.</i>

788
01:15:06,136 --> 01:15:08,232
<i>There will be no problem
if I fight him from afar.</i>

789
01:15:11,023 --> 01:15:14,286
<i>In that way...
I'll have a good long look at your ability.</i>

790
01:15:44,137 --> 01:15:46,776
<i>8 Trigrams, 64 Palms!</i>

791
01:15:55,057 --> 01:15:55,943
<i>What a number!</i>

792
01:16:15,379 --> 01:16:17,851
<i>Hm?! His stance changed?!</i>

793
01:16:19,264 --> 01:16:20,317
<i>8 Trigrams,</i>

794
01:16:20,998 --> 01:16:22,395
<i>128 Palms!</i>

795
01:16:35,205 --> 01:16:37,885
<i>He's fast!
The number of strikes has doubled...!</i>

796
01:16:39,143 --> 01:16:41,656
<i>If I get nailed by that straight on,
it'll be the end for me.</i>

797
01:16:42,770 --> 01:16:44,574
<i>If that's the case on his end,</i>

798
01:16:44,949 --> 01:16:46,919
<i>then it'll be a battle of numbers
on this end, too!</i>

799
01:17:04,775 --> 01:17:07,747
<i>The number's too great!
I won't have enough time!</i>

800
01:17:14,889 --> 01:17:16,485
<i>The Rotation's no good,
just as I thought...</i>

801
01:17:30,355 --> 01:17:33,327
<i>It seems he has 360 degree vision.</i>

802
01:17:33,969 --> 01:17:35,991
<i>And it seems he deals
with enemy attacks</i>

803
01:17:36,263 --> 01:17:39,700
<i>by combining his X-ray vision ability
for seeing through things</i>

804
01:17:39,998 --> 01:17:42,712
<i>and his telescopic vision ability
for long distance sight.</i>

805
01:17:44,330 --> 01:17:48,803
<i>Furthermore, although
he's got 360 degree vision,</i>

806
01:17:49,284 --> 01:17:51,339
<i>that vision has a formidable extent...</i>

807
01:17:52,593 --> 01:17:56,496
<i>If I were to determine the range
from his reaction before...</i>

808
01:17:57,490 --> 01:17:59,385
<i>he almost unfailingly detected
the kunai</i>

809
01:17:59,410 --> 01:18:04,718
<i>that entered the 50-meter radius
around him.</i>

810
01:18:07,358 --> 01:18:08,638
<i>But for some reason,</i>

811
01:18:08,663 --> 01:18:11,366
<i>there are kunai
he can't evade completely.</i>

812
01:18:13,256 --> 01:18:14,309
<i>If so...</i>

813
01:18:21,428 --> 01:18:23,774
<i>8 Trigrams, Sixty...</i>

814
01:18:29,558 --> 01:18:30,846
I see...

815
01:18:35,010 --> 01:18:37,023
This time, there'll be even more.

816
01:18:45,939 --> 01:18:48,118
<i>This time, two will hit...</i>

817
01:19:01,916 --> 01:19:05,096
I've found the perfect way
to counter your ability!

818
01:19:06,459 --> 01:19:08,367
It seems that defense technique

819
01:19:08,803 --> 01:19:12,104
was something to compensate
for this weak point!

820
01:19:13,626 --> 01:19:18,517
In other words...
Your visual jutsu isn't perfect!

821
01:19:23,393 --> 01:19:27,717
Why even bother?!
I've won the game!

822
01:19:37,115 --> 01:19:38,752
You can't beat me!

823
01:19:42,870 --> 01:19:44,633
<i>This is the end...</i>

824
01:20:07,854 --> 01:20:08,484
<i>Gentle Fist!</i>

825
01:20:18,615 --> 01:20:22,754
<i>Small fry number one...
Annihilation complete.</i>

826
01:20:38,718 --> 01:20:42,244
<i>Well, for a crummy game,
I was entertained...</i>

827
01:21:05,784 --> 01:21:10,049
<i>Heh... I missed the fatal spot?</i>

828
01:21:10,819 --> 01:21:15,668
<i>I suppose he wouldn't die so easily
from a kunai at 50 meters.</i>

829
01:21:18,683 --> 01:21:22,281
<i>I see...
He's still going to entertain me, huh?</i>

830
01:21:24,207 --> 01:21:25,761
<i>Here's my thanks for that.</i>

831
01:21:37,081 --> 01:21:48,335
<i>Maximum destructive power...
with 100% accuracy!</i>

832
01:21:59,890 --> 01:22:01,100
<i>Die!</i>

833
01:22:10,685 --> 01:22:12,435
Heh! It's over...

834
01:22:16,607 --> 01:22:17,237
<i>What?!</i>

835
01:22:24,824 --> 01:22:25,753
<i>Just barely...</i>

836
01:22:26,117 --> 01:22:27,295
<i>That was a close one.</i>

837
01:22:28,286 --> 01:22:30,632
<i>But... I was able to throw it off
just a little.</i>

838
01:22:32,081 --> 01:22:33,323
<i>There's no mistake.</i>

839
01:22:34,459 --> 01:22:37,231
<i>He's now realized the secret
of the Byakugan.</i>

840
01:22:39,922 --> 01:22:42,269
<i>What's the meaning of this?
How?!</i>

841
01:22:47,638 --> 01:22:48,984
<i>How was he able to throw it</i>

842
01:22:49,307 --> 01:22:51,069
<i>that far off from his vital point?!</i>

843
01:22:58,903 --> 01:23:01,205
<i>I see... That chakra!</i>

844
01:23:01,690 --> 01:23:04,892
<i>He was emitting chakra
the whole time</i>

845
01:23:05,010 --> 01:23:07,033
<i>and covered the area surrounding him!</i>

846
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:10,436
<i>And over such a wide range, too.</i>

847
01:23:12,455 --> 01:23:14,426
<i>No wonder he was able
to detect the arrow and</i>

848
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:17,771
<i>throw off the trajectory of it.</i>

849
01:23:21,458 --> 01:23:26,077
<i>But constantly emitting that
much chakra is a desperate gamble...</i>

850
01:23:27,553 --> 01:23:29,566
<i>If he doesn't go that far,
he can't dodge.</i>

851
01:23:30,348 --> 01:23:31,985
<i>In other words, there's no mistake.</i>

852
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:33,911
<i>It's as I hypothesized...</i>

853
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:38,590
<i>The arrow earlier was
totally invisible to him!</i>

854
01:23:40,608 --> 01:23:42,787
<i>He doesn't carry out useless attacks...</i>

855
01:23:43,361 --> 01:23:46,374
<i>And from the results,
he accurately examines the information.</i>

856
01:23:54,247 --> 01:23:57,385
<i>And... he's also discovered
the weakness of my eyes...</i>

857
01:23:57,792 --> 01:23:58,802
<i>Impressive.</i>

858
01:24:02,046 --> 01:24:04,142
<i>Of all the enemies
I've fought until now,</i>

859
01:24:04,409 --> 01:24:06,020
<i>this guy's the strongest!</i>

860
01:24:08,657 --> 01:24:10,962
<i>Right behind his first thoracic vertebra...</i>

861
01:24:11,331 --> 01:24:14,553
<i>there exists a blind spot expanding
from a very small point.</i>

862
01:24:26,718 --> 01:24:29,315
<i>Indeed, if he moves and fails
to stabilize the blind spot,</i>

863
01:24:29,878 --> 01:24:32,230
<i>aiming an arrow at it
becomes difficult.</i>

864
01:24:32,771 --> 01:24:36,072
<i>But such a trick... doesn't fool me!</i>

865
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:41,475
<i>Gentle Fist is pointless if
you don't come close to your enemy.</i>

866
01:24:42,123 --> 01:24:46,554
<i>And you can't afford to think about
approaching me at this point.</i>

867
01:24:47,258 --> 01:24:49,088
<i>It's about how to escape now...</i>

868
01:24:50,039 --> 01:24:54,054
<i>Though whether you struggle or not,
you're going to die anyway.</i>

869
01:24:57,890 --> 01:24:58,651
<i>It's useless!</i>

870
01:25:21,478 --> 01:25:22,101
A thread?!

871
01:25:23,599 --> 01:25:25,498
I see, with this thread...

872
01:25:30,265 --> 01:25:32,509
<i>This time, the trajectory was thrown off
slightly by the trees, huh?</i>

873
01:25:40,994 --> 01:25:42,443
<i>If that's the case...</i>

874
01:25:42,901 --> 01:25:45,761
<i>I'll add some rotation this time.</i>

875
01:25:46,561 --> 01:25:48,047
<i>So even if it hits a tree,</i>

876
01:25:48,198 --> 01:25:51,671
<i>it'll just cut through and the trajectory
won't be thrown off.</i>

877
01:25:52,361 --> 01:25:54,248
<i>And as before...</i>

878
01:25:54,273 --> 01:25:57,554
<i>I'll control the arrow up until
150 feet away from him</i>

879
01:25:57,579 --> 01:25:59,503
<i>using a thread with chakra
flowing through.</i>

880
01:25:59,914 --> 01:26:01,844
<i>I'll take aim at the moving target...</i>

881
01:26:02,248 --> 01:26:05,136
<i>and plunge the arrow into
the blind spot with a pinpoint attack!</i>

882
01:26:09,493 --> 01:26:10,921
<i>He's still standing up?</i>

883
01:26:11,979 --> 01:26:15,691
<i>He's strong...
He's much stronger than me.</i>

884
01:26:17,352 --> 01:26:19,115
<i>I hardly have any chakra left now.</i>

885
01:26:20,137 --> 01:26:22,942
<i>I probably won't be able to evade
his next attack completely.</i>

886
01:26:24,150 --> 01:26:25,191
<i>Is this it?</i>

887
01:26:27,823 --> 01:26:29,896
<i>I'll win no matter what!</i>

888
01:26:35,664 --> 01:26:38,292
<i>Naruto... I wonder what you'd do.</i>

889
01:26:40,257 --> 01:26:43,330
<i>He's stopped moving...
Has he given up?</i>

890
01:26:44,409 --> 01:26:46,505
<i>But just to make doubly sure...</i>

891
01:26:47,411 --> 01:26:51,710
<i>Maximum destructive power
with 120% accuracy.</i>

892
01:27:12,303 --> 01:27:13,253
<i>I've got him!</i>

893
01:27:28,627 --> 01:27:29,417
<i>This is it.</i>

894
01:27:31,102 --> 01:27:31,897
<i>Gentle Fist!</i>

895
01:27:53,230 --> 01:27:56,035
<i>Wh-What? He still...?!</i>

896
01:27:56,519 --> 01:28:00,075
<i>No! My attack just now
should have killed him.</i>

897
01:28:00,977 --> 01:28:03,115
<i>Chakra-based substances...</i>

898
01:28:03,424 --> 01:28:05,353
<i>are meaningless against Gentle Fist.</i>

899
01:28:06,850 --> 01:28:07,819
<i>Gentle Fist...</i>

900
01:28:08,137 --> 01:28:09,282
<i>I see...</i>

901
01:28:09,307 --> 01:28:12,989
<i>In his final moments he funneled
the last of his chakra through the thread!</i>

902
01:28:21,911 --> 01:28:22,672
<i>Eight crows...</i>

903
01:28:25,655 --> 01:28:27,403
<i>Again I couldn't see one of them.</i>

904
01:28:36,629 --> 01:28:38,772
<i>He damaged several of
my internal organs.</i>

905
01:28:39,329 --> 01:28:41,529
<i>But... I can still move.</i>

906
01:28:45,499 --> 01:28:47,056
<i>You're not a failure.</i>

907
01:28:51,691 --> 01:28:52,577
<i>Naruto...</i>

908
01:28:53,398 --> 01:28:55,973
Now it's just the three of us...

909
01:28:56,729 --> 01:28:58,621
Don't worry about such things.

910
01:28:59,121 --> 01:29:01,134
Both Choji and Neji will
catch up right away.

911
01:29:01,734 --> 01:29:03,501
Choji had the trump card.

912
01:29:04,398 --> 01:29:08,288
And I fought Neji
in the Chunin Exam, so I know...

913
01:29:09,290 --> 01:29:10,093
Know what?

914
01:29:11,921 --> 01:29:16,282
That he's... a true genius. Believe it!

915
01:29:19,288 --> 01:29:20,842
<i>I cannot lose...</i>

916
01:29:22,322 --> 01:29:24,793
<i>Whether he's an enemy
much stronger than me...</i>

917
01:29:25,083 --> 01:29:26,637
<i>or even if this body should fail me...</i>

918
01:29:27,414 --> 01:29:28,926
<i>I cannot lose!</i>

919
01:29:31,748 --> 01:29:34,970
<i>I have a reason why I cannot lose!</i>

920
01:29:47,636 --> 01:29:50,358
<i>I've had a hard time of it this time.</i>

921
01:29:54,699 --> 01:29:55,752
<i>I played too long...</i>

922
01:29:57,139 --> 01:29:57,646
<i>Huh?</i>

923
01:30:26,147 --> 01:30:27,743
<i>I can't build up chakra...</i>

924
01:30:28,248 --> 01:30:30,469
How? You should've
been instantly killed!

925
01:30:31,241 --> 01:30:32,377
How come you're alive?!

926
01:30:33,143 --> 01:30:35,603
I couldn't completely
evade it anyway.

927
01:30:36,579 --> 01:30:39,509
So I was prepared to deliberately
take the hit.

928
01:30:41,723 --> 01:30:43,402
So you took the hit deliberately...?

929
01:30:43,606 --> 01:30:46,055
It doesn't change the fact
that you're going to die here.

930
01:30:47,203 --> 01:30:48,913
How can you go that far?!

931
01:30:50,604 --> 01:30:55,514
Of all the enemies,
you're the strongest I've ever fought...

932
01:30:56,633 --> 01:30:59,978
But, there's a reason why I cannot lose.

933
01:31:02,608 --> 01:31:09,396
Of all those I've ever fought,
the strongest one said this to me...

934
01:31:12,862 --> 01:31:16,690
- <i>Unlike me... you are not a failure.</i>
- "Unlike me... you are not a failure."

935
01:31:18,452 --> 01:31:19,339
He said that.

936
01:31:21,412 --> 01:31:23,383
I've been called a genius all along.

937
01:31:24,792 --> 01:31:26,721
So I cannot lose.

938
01:31:28,068 --> 01:31:30,039
And for the sake of those guys
who believe

939
01:31:30,064 --> 01:31:32,827
that someone like me is a genius!

940
01:31:34,704 --> 01:31:38,933
Even if you act tough,
you can't stop what's happening...

941
01:31:39,849 --> 01:31:44,042
Sasuke ran to the Hidden Sound Village
of his own free will.

942
01:31:48,023 --> 01:31:48,873
No...

943
01:31:49,777 --> 01:31:55,313
There's a person who can find him
in the darkness and save him.

944
01:31:57,307 --> 01:31:59,849
Sasuke belongs to Lord Orochimaru.

945
01:32:02,731 --> 01:32:05,017
No matter who it may be,
they can't save...

946
01:32:05,042 --> 01:32:05,997
He can save him!

947
01:32:11,301 --> 01:32:14,273
<i>Because... Naruto...</i>

948
01:32:15,078 --> 01:32:18,063
<i>You saved me from the darkness!</i>

949
01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:26,164
Talking rubbish until the end...

950
01:32:29,706 --> 01:32:30,563
But...

951
01:32:31,714 --> 01:32:35,766
<i>I haven't been pushed this far
since Kimimaro.</i>

952
01:32:43,345 --> 01:32:45,327
<i>Damn it...</i>
