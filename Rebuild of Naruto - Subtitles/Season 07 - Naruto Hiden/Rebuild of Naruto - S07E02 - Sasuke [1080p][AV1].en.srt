1
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:44,247
So, what are you doing here?

2
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,125
Sakura said she was coming
to see you, so I tagged along.

3
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,215
What is it, Sakura?

4
00:02:55,154 --> 00:02:59,909
There have been incidents of
Hidden Leaf shinobi going missing.

5
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,324
Going missing?

6
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,976
So you noticed it too, Sakura.

7
00:03:05,905 --> 00:03:07,991
You were already aware of it,
Kakashi-sensei?

8
00:03:08,331 --> 00:03:12,877
Yes. But why were you investigating
something like that?

9
00:03:12,902 --> 00:03:16,823
Well, there's a regular
at Ino's family's flower shop...

10
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:20,795
It's coming from the Aun Gate.

11
00:03:22,276 --> 00:03:24,023
I'll go check it out!

12
00:03:24,048 --> 00:03:25,133
Oh...

13
00:03:25,237 --> 00:03:27,197
Wait, Naruto!

14
00:03:27,537 --> 00:03:29,122
Hey, you two!

15
00:03:32,768 --> 00:03:34,019
I'm counting on you.

16
00:03:34,521 --> 00:03:36,799
Run! Get away from here!

17
00:03:43,226 --> 00:03:44,417
It's the Security Unit...

18
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,693
Why are they only using defense?

19
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,612
I'm going to help 'em!

20
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:58,696
Wait!

21
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,909
Ino? Shikamaru... Choji?

22
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,985
What happened?

23
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,038
It can't be...

24
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:09,874
Tadaichi...

25
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,919
That's Tadaichi!

26
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,837
Tadaichi?

27
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:18,061
You mean your regular
from the flower shop?

28
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:21,054
Are you sure that's him, Ino?

29
00:04:21,536 --> 00:04:23,120
There's no mistake!

30
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,766
But he'd never turn against
the Hidden Leaf!

31
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,435
So why?

32
00:04:31,032 --> 00:04:32,080
So does that mean...

33
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,775
there's a possibility
he's under a genjutsu?

34
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,779
And the others could be
the ones who went missing!

35
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:41,061
What?!

36
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:44,826
Then... these are Hidden Leaf shinobi?

37
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,830
That's why we can't do
anything other than defend!

38
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,429
He didn't even dodge.

39
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,854
Doesn't he feel any pain?

40
00:05:29,234 --> 00:05:30,235
This is bad!

41
00:05:30,876 --> 00:05:32,419
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

42
00:05:35,991 --> 00:05:37,033
Naruto?!

43
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,504
We're going to jump away.

44
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,570
He's an exploding human!

45
00:06:02,308 --> 00:06:03,309
Tadaichi...

46
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,701
It's okay.

47
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,329
Let's go tend to the wounded.

48
00:06:16,179 --> 00:06:17,180
Hey!

49
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:18,936
They're getting in!

50
00:06:19,084 --> 00:06:21,337
Not... them too!

51
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:35,269
It's too big!

52
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,479
Damn!

53
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:37,605
Choji...

54
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,774
Can you make wings
with your expansion?

55
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,234
G-Got it!

56
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:01,336
I'll help!

57
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,089
Let's go, Kurama!

58
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,719
Right!

59
00:07:16,535 --> 00:07:18,621
Did... it help at all?

60
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,897
Good job!

61
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,733
Looks like it ain't over yet.

62
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,947
There are more of them.

63
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,200
Naruto!

64
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:35,163
Getting wounded is probably
what causes them to explode.

65
00:07:35,668 --> 00:07:38,129
I saw strange chakra being
released from the wound,

66
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,126
and the body began
to change shape.

67
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:42,145
Which means,

68
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,963
we have to be careful
how we engage them.

69
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:45,590
Naruto!

70
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:46,946
Hinata!

71
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:48,843
What's happening?

72
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,222
It seems everyone's under
a genjutsu.

73
00:07:54,042 --> 00:07:56,085
Can you see if
someone's controlling them?

74
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,478
All right, I'll check.

75
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,901
<i>Byakugan!</i>

76
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:06,861
I don't see anyone.

77
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,321
No one?!

78
00:08:11,317 --> 00:08:13,194
Then how are they being manipulated?

79
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,956
There's a strange chakra
moving around in their bodies.

80
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,584
Maybe that's what's controlling them.

81
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:25,028
So we just have to take
that chakra away?

82
00:08:27,221 --> 00:08:30,391
The chakra is circulating like
it's part of their body.

83
00:08:31,313 --> 00:08:33,315
The chakra could be fused internally.

84
00:08:33,922 --> 00:08:37,426
So you're saying
we can't just extract it easily.

85
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:38,910
First things first.

86
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,687
We have to start
by capturing them.

87
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,272
But Shikamaru,

88
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,792
it'll be hard to capture them
without inflicting any wounds.

89
00:08:48,136 --> 00:08:50,180
I just had a great idea!

90
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,081
Okay, let's go!

91
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:08,589
<i>First, I'll have my clones
stop the exploding humans.</i>

92
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,758
<i>Shadow Possession Jutsu!</i>

93
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,847
<i>Then Shikamaru will capture them
with his Shadow Possession Jutsu.</i>

94
00:09:18,447 --> 00:09:19,163
Hinata!

95
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,410
Right!

96
00:09:23,293 --> 00:09:25,831
<i>And lastly, Hinata will pierce
their critical chakra points</i>

97
00:09:25,855 --> 00:09:27,024
<i>so that they can't move.</i>

98
00:09:27,411 --> 00:09:29,163
They won't be able to move
for a day.

99
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,613
You okay, Hinata?

100
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:34,615
Yes.

101
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,659
I'll fight with you.

102
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:00,891
It's no good.

103
00:10:01,615 --> 00:10:03,867
My genjutsu reversal has
no effect against

104
00:10:03,963 --> 00:10:07,967
the special kind of chakra
circulating in the body.

105
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,568
Don't get so depressed.

106
00:10:12,101 --> 00:10:15,980
Whoever did it,
that's a genjutsu unknown to us.

107
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:20,119
It has to be the work of someone
with extraordinary skill.

108
00:10:22,661 --> 00:10:25,914
So it will require someone
with exceptional visual jutsu powers.

109
00:10:27,468 --> 00:10:28,469
Visual jutsu?

110
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:32,798
Good observation!

111
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,218
I-I didn't say anything!

112
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,512
Didn't say what?

113
00:10:39,767 --> 00:10:40,538
Don't ask!

114
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:42,894
Naruto!

115
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,853
We may not be able to see anything.

116
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:49,924
But the one who possesses both
the Sharingan and Rinnegan just might.

117
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,026
Huh?! You mean...?

118
00:10:53,835 --> 00:10:55,290
I'll call Sasuke back.

119
00:10:57,353 --> 00:10:58,480
Can I ask you to do it?

120
00:10:58,866 --> 00:10:59,867
Yes.

121
00:11:02,021 --> 00:11:04,148
Sasuke's going to come back!

122
00:12:11,825 --> 00:12:14,035
Return to the Hidden Leaf Village. huh?

123
00:12:24,107 --> 00:12:27,547
A human exploded!

124
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,417
D-Damn you!

125
00:12:31,442 --> 00:12:32,443
Stop!

126
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:04,410
Don't tell me that's the exploding
human that attacked the Hidden Leaf?!

127
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,036
Why? A village like this?

128
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,163
Old Man Iou!

129
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,924
Chino, stall them.

130
00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:17,368
You got it, Nowaki!

131
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:21,302
<i>Water Style: Water Formation Wall!</i>

132
00:13:27,536 --> 00:13:28,621
Shinobi?

133
00:13:31,956 --> 00:13:33,999
What's going on?

134
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,023
Wh-What?!

135
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,984
Are you one of them?

136
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:40,402
You've got it all wrong.

137
00:13:40,849 --> 00:13:42,183
Silence!

138
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:46,043
They asked you to come
and get even, didn't they?

139
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,701
Get even?

140
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,621
Young ones!
What are you doing?

141
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,748
Damn it!

142
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,960
Sorry, I don't have anything
against you, but...

143
00:13:58,861 --> 00:13:59,862
<i>Water Style:</i>

144
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:03,347
<i>Rain Hail!</i>

145
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:06,388
<i>Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!</i>

146
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,266
What?!

147
00:14:10,837 --> 00:14:13,840
I didn't know Fire Style
could beat Water Style!

148
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,446
Get back.

149
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,364
A Change in Nature of Wind, huh?

150
00:14:26,944 --> 00:14:29,488
Oh, come on!
Hurry up and kill him!

151
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,956
No one told me he was so strong!

152
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,334
You spineless—!

153
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:49,305
You can tell me later why
you mistook me for someone else.

154
00:14:58,382 --> 00:14:59,383
That eye...

155
00:15:00,674 --> 00:15:01,800
The Sharingan?!

156
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:04,486
Uchiha...

157
00:15:06,368 --> 00:15:08,996
Why did the villagers end up like this?

158
00:15:09,307 --> 00:15:10,767
How should I know?!

159
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,535
The one you mistook me for
is involved in some way, right?

160
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:17,258
I've got nothing to say!

161
00:15:19,814 --> 00:15:21,093
I-I'm sorry.

162
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,918
We don't know
what's going on either.

163
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:29,845
From the looks of it,
you're not from this village, are you?

164
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,308
We're former shinobi
who are now traveling performers.

165
00:15:34,745 --> 00:15:36,767
We finished a gig at a resort

166
00:15:36,792 --> 00:15:38,711
in the Village Hidden
in the Hot Springs.

167
00:15:39,478 --> 00:15:42,189
It's pretty profitable there
for entertainers like us.

168
00:15:45,507 --> 00:15:46,091
Anyway...

169
00:15:46,231 --> 00:15:48,704
We decided to head somewhere else,

170
00:15:48,729 --> 00:15:52,276
so we came through the Bamboo Village
to stock up on supplies.

171
00:15:53,997 --> 00:15:57,427
And Old Man Iou's daughter
is such a great person!

172
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:01,168
She made us really good food!

173
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:04,421
By the way, is my daughter...
Is Amino okay?

174
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,012
Amino!

175
00:16:08,212 --> 00:16:11,465
We had all the women and
children take shelter...

176
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,621
Hey!

177
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,770
We have no choice
but to ask these guys directly.

178
00:16:34,664 --> 00:16:35,665
Amino?!

179
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,038
An exploding human?!

180
00:16:39,737 --> 00:16:42,406
Iou, don't get close.
It's too dangerous.

181
00:16:42,856 --> 00:16:45,192
Who cares if it's dangerous?!

182
00:16:45,802 --> 00:16:48,666
That's my daughter!

183
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:51,104
Let go... Let me go!

184
00:16:54,565 --> 00:16:56,191
Amino!

185
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,663
I'll never forgive you.

186
00:17:20,688 --> 00:17:22,940
Never... Fuushin...

187
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:28,297
I'll never forgive you, Fuushin!

188
00:17:45,174 --> 00:17:46,676
Who is Fuushin?

189
00:17:48,222 --> 00:17:50,044
The leader of the Lightning Gang.

190
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,279
The Lightning Gang?

191
00:17:55,748 --> 00:18:00,294
They take money from bad people

192
00:18:00,661 --> 00:18:03,873
and distribute it
to poor people like us.

193
00:18:03,937 --> 00:18:05,188
They're honorable thieves.

194
00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:09,480
So why would their leader
try to get even?

195
00:18:11,881 --> 00:18:13,549
This is just what I heard...

196
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:18,597
The Lightning Gang was betrayed
by the Hidden Mist...

197
00:18:20,498 --> 00:18:23,125
It seems they barely escaped
with their lives

198
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,818
and found their way to this village.

199
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:28,807
Just for a little while...
Let us rest here.

200
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,859
Please go somewhere else.

201
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,171
What?

202
00:18:32,646 --> 00:18:36,866
If we harbor you,
we'll end up paying dearly for it!

203
00:18:38,277 --> 00:18:40,488
We have no intentions of
troubling the village!

204
00:18:41,008 --> 00:18:42,385
We'll leave right away!

205
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:45,710
Just because you take money
from others and give it away,

206
00:18:45,761 --> 00:18:48,514
don't think you can do
whatever you want!

207
00:18:50,528 --> 00:18:53,447
The village rejected
the Lightning Gang.

208
00:18:59,528 --> 00:19:00,570
What are you going to do?

209
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,475
I'm going to look inside memories
of the exploding humans.

210
00:19:03,699 --> 00:19:04,427
Huh?

211
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:03,794
Are you okay?

212
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,081
That red eye...

213
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,833
There's no doubt about it...

214
00:20:11,032 --> 00:20:12,546
It's a Kekkei Genkai.

215
00:20:19,527 --> 00:20:22,154
"Encountered Exploding Humans."

216
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:27,153
"Will investigate independently.
Please approve."

217
00:20:30,686 --> 00:20:33,917
Just how long will
your journey continue?

218
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,626
Sasuke, where are you going?

219
00:20:54,405 --> 00:20:56,939
You're Sasuke Uchiha, right?

220
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:02,386
The lone survivor of
the exalted Uchiha Clan.

221
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,504
I knew it the moment I saw
your Sharingan last night.

222
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,470
Where are you going now?

223
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,256
That has nothing to do with you.

224
00:21:12,327 --> 00:21:14,037
It does involve us!

225
00:21:15,529 --> 00:21:16,777
Amino...

226
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,778
... made us yummy meals.

227
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,866
She was kind.

228
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,871
You're going to look for
that Fuushin guy, right?

229
00:21:33,456 --> 00:21:35,791
But isn't he the one who changed
Amino and the others

230
00:21:35,816 --> 00:21:37,572
into those exploding humans
or whatever, right?

231
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,924
We're going with you.

232
00:21:40,949 --> 00:21:42,939
I think we may be able to help.

233
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:52,477
And don't give us that look that says
"I don't need you guys!"

234
00:21:52,502 --> 00:21:54,400
That will only make us more determined!

235
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:57,163
Sasuke, are you listening?!

236
00:22:01,385 --> 00:22:04,428
I don't care what you do.
Just stop calling me that.

237
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,033
I figure I'm older than you, Sasuke.

238
00:22:08,412 --> 00:22:11,191
So I can treat you like a kid.

239
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,128
Older? You?

240
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,695
Ahem!

241
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,753
By that much?

242
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:27,286
What do you mean by "that much"?

243
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:34,161
Sasuke, it's not good
to judge people by their looks

244
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,128
or by your impression of them.

245
00:22:38,247 --> 00:22:40,079
<i>You shouldn't judge people</i>

246
00:22:40,104 --> 00:22:42,440
<i>by their looks or
by your impression of them.</i>

247
00:22:42,765 --> 00:22:44,507
<i>Are you going to join too, Big Brother?</i>

248
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,890
<i>I wonder...</i>

249
00:22:47,178 --> 00:22:50,138
<i>You should! When I'm older...</i>

250
00:22:50,273 --> 00:22:52,546
<i>I'm going to join
the Leaf Police Force too!</i>

251
00:22:53,016 --> 00:22:54,977
<i>Forgive me, Sasuke...</i>

252
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,417
<i>This is the last time.</i>

253
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:04,313
<i>No matter what becomes of you,
I will always love you.</i>

254
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,265
Sasuke!

255
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,589
Sasuke!

256
00:23:10,238 --> 00:23:14,355
By the way... Have you been back to
the Hidden Leaf Village. Sasuke?

257
00:23:16,701 --> 00:23:18,859
What? Ignoring me again?

258
00:23:19,288 --> 00:23:23,539
What about reviving the Uchiha Clan?
You're the lone survivor, right?

259
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,382
Hello! Are you there, Sasuke?!

260
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,449
Chino, stop it.

261
00:23:30,405 --> 00:23:34,343
Whose side are you on anyway?
You know, you...

262
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:42,587
Hey, where are we going?

263
00:23:44,162 --> 00:23:45,872
Ignoring me again!

264
00:23:47,069 --> 00:23:48,904
I mean...

265
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:50,303
Hey.

266
00:23:50,482 --> 00:23:53,443
My name isn't "hey"!

267
00:23:54,094 --> 00:23:56,471
You asked if I'm going to
look for Fuushin.

268
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:58,376
The answer is yes.

269
00:23:58,478 --> 00:23:59,391
Huh?

270
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,850
That's what I should do right now.

271
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,070
A-Any ideas on where to look?

272
00:24:07,829 --> 00:24:10,215
The only thing that can create
an Exploding Human

273
00:24:10,562 --> 00:24:12,414
is a Kekkei Genkai.

274
00:24:14,643 --> 00:24:19,440
H-Hey, Sasuke...
Hold on a minute...

275
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:28,377
You think you'll find him inside
that really scary-looking cave?

276
00:24:30,601 --> 00:24:32,937
Ignoring me again!

277
00:24:41,786 --> 00:24:43,872
You're Sasuke, right?

278
00:24:44,647 --> 00:24:47,441
You can call me Yamato.

279
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:52,779
Since you're watching over this place,
it must mean that Orochimaru is here.

280
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:55,951
O-Orochimaru? You mean that—?!

281
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,475
What's the purpose of your visit?

282
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:03,884
I can't allow just anyone through
to see Orochimaru.

283
00:25:04,557 --> 00:25:07,160
Regarding the Exploding Humans
that attacked the Hidden Leaf...

284
00:25:07,577 --> 00:25:12,124
It's possible Orochimaru may have
information about the perpetrator.

285
00:25:15,137 --> 00:25:17,639
Did you send word about this
to Lord Sixth?

286
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:20,843
I intend to, if I get results.

287
00:25:22,631 --> 00:25:25,653
It would be much easier for us
to coordinate things,

288
00:25:25,882 --> 00:25:28,927
if you'd send us progress reports...

289
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,092
However...

290
00:25:32,422 --> 00:25:35,718
You're doing this all for the sake
of the Hidden Leaf, right?

291
00:25:40,816 --> 00:25:41,742
Yeah...

292
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:46,136
Then there's nothing else to say.

293
00:25:46,973 --> 00:25:49,976
I'll send Lord Sixth a report.

294
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,247
Remember, we're comrades.

295
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:58,023
I'm sure Kakashi also taught you
the importance of trust and teamwork.

296
00:25:59,765 --> 00:26:01,058
Thank you...

297
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:16,783
It's been a long time, Sasuke.

298
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:20,480
You've brought some
interesting-looking friends with you.

299
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:24,987
Do you know Fuushin
of the Lightning Gang?

300
00:26:25,798 --> 00:26:30,636
What? Not even a greeting?
You're as blunt as ever.

301
00:26:30,765 --> 00:26:33,685
Tell me everything you know.

302
00:26:34,405 --> 00:26:37,950
Is that any way to ask
a person something?

303
00:26:38,187 --> 00:26:39,897
Hurry up.

304
00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:45,312
Fuushin possesses a Kekkei Genkai...

305
00:26:45,582 --> 00:26:48,723
I believe he originally was a member
of En Oyashiro's guard unit.

306
00:26:49,264 --> 00:26:50,501
En Oyashiro?

307
00:26:50,991 --> 00:26:53,395
He's not affiliated with any group.

308
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:58,578
Even though he's a shinobi,
he's an arms trader.

309
00:26:59,216 --> 00:27:03,178
He'll sell weapons to anyone
for the right price,

310
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,374
so he's known as
the "Merchant of Death."

311
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:10,222
He's amassed a huge fortune
during his lifetime.

312
00:27:11,207 --> 00:27:12,500
Where is he?

313
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,016
Who knows...

314
00:27:14,353 --> 00:27:17,940
He has a hideout
even better hidden than mine.

315
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:21,773
I think finding him
will be very difficult.

316
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:26,776
For you, even the difficult is easy.

317
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:32,047
Does that mean you trust me?

318
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:39,049
Well, I don't know where to find him,
but I can lure him out.

319
00:27:39,974 --> 00:27:44,729
However...
that may cause a few problems.

320
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:48,166
Why do you think I came here?

321
00:27:49,017 --> 00:27:51,158
How unlike you...

322
00:27:51,623 --> 00:27:54,542
I'm just doing what I have to.

323
00:27:56,831 --> 00:27:58,634
I sense the wind.

324
00:27:59,409 --> 00:28:03,830
Wait here.
It will take some time to prepare.

325
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:10,939
Sasuke!

326
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:13,986
I didn't know that
you knew Orochimaru.

327
00:28:14,297 --> 00:28:15,892
I don't recall ever telling you.

328
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,970
Sasuke!

329
00:28:21,894 --> 00:28:25,523
Hey! Why didn't you
let me know you're coming?

330
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,713
Sasuke...

331
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,259
"Sasuke"?!

332
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:36,309
What? Is she your girlfriend, Sasuke?

333
00:28:37,352 --> 00:28:41,985
You mean, that ugly hag?

334
00:28:42,528 --> 00:28:45,490
Hey! Who are you calling ugly?!

335
00:28:45,945 --> 00:28:48,447
Sasuke, say it's not true!

336
00:28:48,569 --> 00:28:49,590
It's not true.

337
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:57,152
You should've seen
the look of panic on your face.

338
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,236
Shut up!

339
00:28:58,261 --> 00:29:01,142
If it weren't for that
big mouth of yours!

340
00:29:01,171 --> 00:29:03,485
That's no excuse for looking like...

341
00:29:03,593 --> 00:29:05,470
- It's been awhile.
- It's the end of the world!

342
00:29:06,692 --> 00:29:08,581
You've been continuing your travels?

343
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:10,609
Yeah.

344
00:29:12,093 --> 00:29:13,916
You haven't gone back to
Hidden Leaf Village.

345
00:29:14,068 --> 00:29:17,154
See, you're worried sick
about Sasuke.

346
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:20,593
You're really getting on my nerves!

347
00:29:21,889 --> 00:29:24,142
Quiet, you guys.

348
00:29:25,034 --> 00:29:28,014
I'm ready. Shall we go?

349
00:29:28,595 --> 00:29:31,642
Lord Orochimaru, are you going out?

350
00:29:32,405 --> 00:29:35,116
Sasuke and I are going to the sea.

351
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,802
Huh?!

352
00:29:37,266 --> 00:29:39,102
The ocean? With Sasuke?

353
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,604
You all will stay and mind the fort.

354
00:29:42,521 --> 00:29:46,609
The sea with Lord Orochimaru?
I can't quite picture it.

355
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,259
Wait, that's news to me too.

356
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:52,875
To be more precise,
a solitary island in the sea.

357
00:29:53,114 --> 00:29:56,367
There's a paradise for the wealthy there.

358
00:29:57,762 --> 00:29:59,931
And that's where En Oyashiro is?

359
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,550
If he takes the bait.

360
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,496
- Nowaki.
- Yeah.

361
00:30:08,966 --> 00:30:10,648
Sasuke...

362
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:13,737
Bleh!

363
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:18,419
What's with that girl?
Want to fight?

364
00:30:18,444 --> 00:30:20,447
Oh, what a drag.

365
00:30:26,529 --> 00:30:29,532
Sasuke working for
the sake of strangers...

366
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:35,697
The Hidden Leaf was attacked...
They're not strangers...

367
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:39,294
But he didn't return to the village.

368
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:41,407
I wonder if it's hard
for him to go back?

369
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:43,718
Don't you guys get it?

370
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:47,362
The big war might be over,

371
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,788
but there are still lots of
dangerous characters lurking around.

372
00:30:50,324 --> 00:30:52,724
As long as Sasuke has those eyes...

373
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,402
shinobi will continue
to attack the village.

374
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,319
So by showing that Sasuke Uchiha
isn't in Hidden Leaf Village

375
00:30:59,344 --> 00:31:02,556
and he's still traveling
around the world,

376
00:31:02,758 --> 00:31:05,759
it lessens the possibility that
the village will be harmed.

377
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:10,177
So then,
Sasuke has to continue traveling?

378
00:31:11,884 --> 00:31:13,707
That might be it.

379
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,716
Still...

380
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:27,965
The fact that you, the one who instigated
the destruction of the Hidden Leaf,

381
00:31:28,612 --> 00:31:31,782
the assassination of the Fourth Kazekage
and countless other horrific crimes,

382
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:36,420
can still move around freely
is quite astonishing.

383
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,357
I'm not free.

384
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:45,945
And who are you to talk, Sasuke?

385
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:50,533
By all rights, you should be locked up.

386
00:31:51,233 --> 00:31:53,736
But even Kabuto,

387
00:31:53,761 --> 00:31:57,035
one of the war criminals from
the Fourth Ninja World War

388
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,813
is now the director of an orphanage...

389
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,743
Kabuto is?

390
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,297
Of course, compared to me,

391
00:32:04,386 --> 00:32:08,619
the likelihood that Kabuto will
resort to evil is lower.

392
00:32:09,523 --> 00:32:11,067
How can you be so sure?

393
00:32:13,627 --> 00:32:16,721
Don't you trust the power
of Itachi Uchiha?

394
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:22,372
You and I, and Kabuto
could just be insurance...

395
00:32:22,397 --> 00:32:27,210
in case something happens that cannot
be countered with common sense.

396
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,197
Insurance?

397
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,682
In every era, a maverick appears.

398
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:36,722
When that happens, there may be
a need for people like us

399
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:39,333
who possess powers
considered to be inhuman.

400
00:32:39,711 --> 00:32:43,006
There are things that cannot be
protected by righteousness alone.

401
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:48,867
If that's the case, keeping us around
like pets might be mutually beneficial.

402
00:32:50,278 --> 00:32:51,362
But...

403
00:32:52,047 --> 00:32:57,511
your friend would never even
think of such a tactic.

404
00:33:00,084 --> 00:33:01,333
Probably not.

405
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,652
There...
You can see it in the distance.

406
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:26,295
Where are we?

407
00:33:26,554 --> 00:33:29,783
This is an island that
you can't find on any map.

408
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,467
Oh...

409
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,344
Let's go.

410
00:33:51,567 --> 00:33:53,349
What is this place?

411
00:33:53,554 --> 00:33:55,931
It's called the Coliseum.

412
00:33:56,393 --> 00:33:57,775
Coliseum?

413
00:34:02,251 --> 00:34:06,714
Is everyone enjoying themselves so far?

414
00:34:08,002 --> 00:34:10,880
Honors to the victor!
Despair to the vanquished!

415
00:34:11,672 --> 00:34:13,092
As you know, the rules are simple!

416
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:17,096
The one with your ID tag goes up against
one with another person's ID tag.

417
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:21,184
And the winner is whoever manages
to take his opponent's ID tag...

418
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:25,104
Simply put, it's a survival match!

419
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,108
What's going on, Orochimaru?

420
00:34:29,713 --> 00:34:31,465
You heard the explanation.

421
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:36,574
The wealthy patrons here pit their shinobi
against shinobi employed by others.

422
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:40,661
The losing shinobi becomes theirs.

423
00:34:41,718 --> 00:34:44,554
And now, today's semi-final match!

424
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,627
Now entering the ring...

425
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:51,714
Wearing the ID tag of President Makibi
of the Makibi Corporation...

426
00:34:52,014 --> 00:34:55,003
Raimei, the Black Lightning Flash!

427
00:34:57,469 --> 00:34:58,793
His opponent...

428
00:34:58,928 --> 00:35:02,765
Wearing the ID tag of President Himeyuri
of the Himeyuri Company...

429
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:06,131
Suzuran, the Eerie Flame
of the White Moon!

430
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,925
This place is like a casino.

431
00:35:13,162 --> 00:35:14,911
All right, let's begin!

432
00:35:15,076 --> 00:35:18,215
It's now or never, no foul play,
no grudges afterward...

433
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,772
A single-bout challenge!

434
00:35:20,067 --> 00:35:21,193
Ready?

435
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,020
Fight!

436
00:35:38,014 --> 00:35:41,059
I don't have time to waste
on sick hobbies.

437
00:35:41,552 --> 00:35:43,407
Where is En Oyashiro?

438
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,514
I wonder...

439
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:50,925
But this is about the only place
that he'll show up.

440
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:54,152
Although, he won't come
if there's no shinobi he wants.

441
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:58,531
Whoa! Suzuran is down!

442
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:02,201
The winner is Raimei!

443
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,913
President Makibi is overjoyed!

444
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,704
You're useless!

445
00:36:09,729 --> 00:36:13,678
Why do you think
I kept you all this time?!

446
00:36:13,898 --> 00:36:16,192
You ingrate...

447
00:36:17,594 --> 00:36:19,471
This place is worthless.

448
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,769
Then why don't you help?

449
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:27,101
To a victim, the assailant and
a third party are no different.

450
00:36:28,077 --> 00:36:33,040
People are no better than the assailant
if they don't try to help.

451
00:36:34,218 --> 00:36:41,058
If you only pity the loser and do nothing
to stop the decadence of the rich...

452
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:44,461
you're just as guilty, Sasuke.

453
00:36:45,248 --> 00:36:46,737
Chino, stop.

454
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,292
Chino!

455
00:36:54,318 --> 00:36:58,341
Was this sight too shocking
for a child?

456
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:01,052
No, she's older than me.

457
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,033
What?

458
00:37:04,248 --> 00:37:05,819
The wait is finally over!

459
00:37:06,004 --> 00:37:07,677
Now, for the main event!

460
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:13,272
Wearing En Oyashiro's ID tag is Futsu!

461
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:16,974
It seems he took the bait.

462
00:37:18,127 --> 00:37:22,381
And his opponent will be wearing
Lord Orochimaru's ID tag...

463
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:26,518
The legendary shinobi who attacked
the Five Kage Summit...

464
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:30,998
The last Uchiha...
Sasuke Uchiha!

465
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,773
What is the meaning of this?!

466
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:43,511
I told you. Oyashiro will only
appear for something he wants.

467
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:48,557
He is... a collector of Kekkei Genkai.

468
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:51,185
A collector of Kekkei Genkai?

469
00:37:51,433 --> 00:37:52,411
Yes...

470
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,730
As for you with
your Sharingan, Sasuke...

471
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:58,317
He probably wants you so bad,
he can taste it.

472
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:03,215
Couldn't he have just searched
for me if he knew I was here?

473
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:06,443
Oyashiro is a careful man.

474
00:38:06,468 --> 00:38:10,866
He can easily camouflage his scent,
let alone his appearance and form.

475
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,457
Who knows where he is?

476
00:38:13,912 --> 00:38:19,415
However, he will definitely appear
after the match for the ID tag transfer.

477
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:22,192
That's the custom here.

478
00:38:23,938 --> 00:38:27,604
Wait a minute,
could this be a default?

479
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,557
Now go...

480
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:34,370
He's here! He arrives, ready to go!

481
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:37,356
Sasuke Uchiha has appeared!

482
00:38:38,765 --> 00:38:41,110
So that's Sasuke Uchiha.

483
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:44,739
Let me see your Sharingan.

484
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:47,241
All right, let us begin!

485
00:38:47,485 --> 00:38:50,870
It's now or never, no foul play,
no grudges afterward...

486
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:52,146
A single-bout challenge!

487
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:53,620
Ready...

488
00:38:53,897 --> 00:38:55,315
Fight!

489
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:14,769
Vapor Style: Solid Fog Jutsu, eh?

490
00:39:23,215 --> 00:39:25,217
P-President Makibi?

491
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:26,947
Is he all right?!

492
00:39:26,972 --> 00:39:28,791
A-Ambulance!
Call an ambulance!

493
00:39:38,463 --> 00:39:39,637
<i>An Exploding Human?</i>

494
00:39:44,707 --> 00:39:45,708
What is that?!

495
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,426
Get away from him!

496
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,228
So that's the Sharingan.

497
00:40:05,146 --> 00:40:06,898
What a surprise.

498
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:11,700
Sasuke using his Sharingan
to save someone's life...

499
00:40:12,416 --> 00:40:13,087
Huh?

500
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,871
W-Watch out!

501
00:40:20,707 --> 00:40:21,708
What happened?!

502
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:25,798
Lady Himeyuri!

503
00:40:26,927 --> 00:40:29,577
Just what is going on?

504
00:40:30,884 --> 00:40:32,261
Leave one of them to me!

505
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:35,132
We can't save them...

506
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,184
but we can lessen the damage!

507
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:45,860
How bothersome.

508
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:21,520
Chino!

509
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,163
What is it?

510
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,263
I didn't expect you to save me...
Sasuke.

511
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:48,172
Thank you.

512
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,312
Chino!

513
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,344
Are you okay?

514
00:41:53,602 --> 00:41:55,896
I'm fine, I'm fine... Ow!

515
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:58,599
You need to get that taken care of.

516
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:04,772
These are the Exploding Humans that
attacked the Hidden Leaf Village.

517
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,775
They're quite troublesome.

518
00:42:12,008 --> 00:42:16,137
I can't make contact with him,
so I'm going to get going.

519
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,704
Looks like you won't get
to meet Oyashiro.

520
00:42:20,796 --> 00:42:21,963
What?

521
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:25,626
I told you, didn't I?
He's a very cautious man.

522
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:32,716
I can't imagine he'd stick around
after all this uproar.

523
00:42:33,082 --> 00:42:35,394
And since the match
ended midway,

524
00:42:35,516 --> 00:42:38,477
there won't be an ID tag
transfer ceremony either.

525
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:42,893
Besides, we won't be able
to get any intel on Fuushin,

526
00:42:43,044 --> 00:42:45,241
who belonged to
Oyashiro's former guard unit,

527
00:42:45,301 --> 00:42:48,429
who's making all
these Exploding Humans.

528
00:42:48,963 --> 00:42:51,578
This has been
a total waste of time.

529
00:42:56,475 --> 00:42:57,559
Lord Orochimaru.

530
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:03,664
What did you say?

531
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,249
Sasuke...

532
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:08,255
Oyashiro is asking for you.

533
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,380
Go on ahead.

534
00:43:11,703 --> 00:43:12,519
What about you?

535
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:16,093
I'm going to get
this wound looked at.

536
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:18,429
I'll stick with Chino.

537
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,139
All right.

538
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,574
Oh, hello!

539
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:40,643
I am En Oyashiro.

540
00:43:41,416 --> 00:43:42,447
Nice to meet you!

541
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:49,960
Is he really En Oyashiro?

542
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,837
There's no mistake.

543
00:43:55,994 --> 00:43:58,705
It's been a long time,
Orochimaru!

544
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:03,390
When was the last time
we were face to face like this?

545
00:44:05,371 --> 00:44:08,290
It's been so long,
I don't remember.

546
00:44:08,748 --> 00:44:11,607
What's going on?

547
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,571
I don't recall you being someone

548
00:44:13,596 --> 00:44:17,475
who'd reveal himself so casually
before others like this.

549
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:21,617
It's only because I witnessed
something very interesting.

550
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:28,540
Though it was quite a shock to
see humans explode like that.

551
00:44:28,949 --> 00:44:31,660
They're just like
the Exploding Humans

552
00:44:31,685 --> 00:44:33,520
that attacked
the Hidden Leaf, right?

553
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:34,588
You know about that?

554
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,840
You can't be in
my line of business

555
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,842
if you're not on top of the news.

556
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:43,889
They appeared because
they were after you, right?

557
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:51,038
Perhaps, this time.

558
00:44:51,662 --> 00:44:53,664
This time?

559
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:56,652
Are you saying that they attacked
the Hidden Leaf Village

560
00:44:56,677 --> 00:44:57,845
for a different purpose?

561
00:44:59,566 --> 00:45:02,236
I mean, doesn't it seem like it?

562
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:06,914
<i>They attacked the Hidden Leaf Village.
with me as their target?</i>

563
00:45:12,478 --> 00:45:14,981
The man creating
the Exploding Humans

564
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:17,256
seems to be a former member
of your guard unit.

565
00:45:17,413 --> 00:45:19,081
What? No way!

566
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,551
His name is Fuushin.

567
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:21,692
You know him, don't you?

568
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:24,805
Hmm... That kid?

569
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:28,142
He initially belonged to someone else.

570
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,393
Someone else?

571
00:45:29,646 --> 00:45:33,441
I won him at the Coliseum and
assigned him to my guard unit.

572
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:37,094
I believe he was born on
a small island in the Land of Water.

573
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:39,683
When he was young,

574
00:45:39,882 --> 00:45:42,718
he was sold off by the islanders
because they were scared of him.

575
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:44,742
Sold off?

576
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:48,495
Isn't that how it is with
the Kekkei Genkai?

577
00:45:49,687 --> 00:45:54,150
Weak humans who
consider themselves "normal"

578
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:55,959
always fear unusual power.

579
00:45:56,784 --> 00:45:59,954
It's a disadvantage from
the moment you manifest it.

580
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:06,221
Though personally,
I like Kekkei Genkai.

581
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:10,809
I mean, they're powerful and rare!

582
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,629
That's why I've collected
all different kinds for my guard unit.

583
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:18,609
I've even slaughtered the rest

584
00:46:18,634 --> 00:46:21,059
and left only one to
increase the rarity...

585
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:24,782
The only thing is,

586
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:27,261
because of the difficult situations
surrounding their upbringing,

587
00:46:27,286 --> 00:46:28,829
many of the kids were rebellious.

588
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:31,622
If I didn't know medical ninjutsu,

589
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,791
I probably couldn't
have tamed them.

590
00:46:34,223 --> 00:46:37,560
Fuushin was a relatively good kid,

591
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:41,287
but one day, all of a sudden,
he took the other kids and ran away.

592
00:46:41,758 --> 00:46:43,996
I wonder why he ran away?

593
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:49,233
I fed them every day and
even gave them an allowance.

594
00:46:49,283 --> 00:46:50,576
I've heard enough!

595
00:46:51,537 --> 00:46:53,497
Did Fuushin have red eyes?

596
00:46:54,825 --> 00:46:55,856
Red eyes?

597
00:47:00,124 --> 00:47:01,928
Oh, now that you mention it...

598
00:47:03,244 --> 00:47:07,165
One of the kids who ran away with
Fuushin had eyes like that.

599
00:47:07,353 --> 00:47:08,771
Ran away with Fuushin?

600
00:47:09,736 --> 00:47:11,725
<i>So Fuushin has a partner?</i>

601
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,665
<i>Was that genjutsu trap
his doing?</i>

602
00:47:16,136 --> 00:47:17,137
What was his name?

603
00:47:18,657 --> 00:47:19,616
I've forgotten.

604
00:47:19,811 --> 00:47:21,021
Then remember.

605
00:47:21,103 --> 00:47:22,730
You're so harsh!

606
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,267
Oh, I know!

607
00:47:26,292 --> 00:47:29,255
That kid was from the Chinoike Clan.

608
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:31,139
The Chinoike Clan?

609
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:32,684
What is that?

610
00:47:33,704 --> 00:47:35,175
It's a tragic story.

611
00:47:35,687 --> 00:47:37,898
I don't care, tell me.

612
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,447
It goes way back...

613
00:47:40,472 --> 00:47:46,971
Even before the time Hashirama Senju
and Madara Uchiha competed for power.

614
00:47:49,216 --> 00:47:51,086
Bloodshot eyes...

615
00:47:51,866 --> 00:47:54,408
The Chinoike Clan with
their Ketsuryugan.

616
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:57,662
They lived in
the Land of Lightning.

617
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,010
They were especially proficient
with genjutsu

618
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:02,581
and once you were caught
in their visual Jutsu,

619
00:48:02,606 --> 00:48:05,066
it was said
you could never escape.

620
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,635
Anyway, one of the Chinoike Clan
women was sent

621
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:12,890
to become the concubine of
the feudal lord of the Land of Lightning.

622
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:17,352
She was personable and beautiful...

623
00:48:18,509 --> 00:48:20,720
and that made the lord's consort
terribly jealous.

624
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:27,154
Unfortunately, shortly after taking
the girl as his concubine,

625
00:48:27,179 --> 00:48:30,641
the feudal lord became ill and died.

626
00:48:31,985 --> 00:48:34,404
"It's her fault he died!"

627
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:38,291
The lord's consort put all
the blame on the concubine.

628
00:48:40,476 --> 00:48:45,398
And those who knew about
the Chinoike Clan's unusual genetics,

629
00:48:45,817 --> 00:48:48,512
supported the consort's claim.

630
00:48:51,217 --> 00:48:54,136
As a result, the girl and
her entire clan

631
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,725
were exiled to a place known
as Hell Valley.

632
00:48:57,046 --> 00:48:59,799
And for that, the consort hired...

633
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,105
What's the matter?

634
00:49:04,666 --> 00:49:05,917
The Uchiha Clan.

635
00:49:07,689 --> 00:49:08,978
What did you say?

636
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,932
The Uchiha Clan with their Sharingan
were the only ones

637
00:49:11,957 --> 00:49:14,042
who could go up against
the Chinoike Clan

638
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:17,079
and their unique visual Jutsu.

639
00:49:17,936 --> 00:49:21,620
The Chinoike asked the Uchiha to set up
a meeting place to negotiate,

640
00:49:21,966 --> 00:49:23,927
but were rejected.

641
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:30,258
Seems the Uchiha Clan who suffered
long through persecution

642
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:33,512
were also complicit in
the persecution of others.

643
00:49:34,988 --> 00:49:36,281
What about Itachi?

644
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,449
Was Itachi aware of this?

645
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:42,562
I wonder...

646
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:44,690
However...

647
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:48,986
you may learn something
if you go to Hell Valley.

648
00:49:54,939 --> 00:49:56,535
Where is Hell Valley located?

649
00:49:57,612 --> 00:49:58,863
It's in the Land of Steam.

650
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:04,042
Are you going?

651
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,169
I don't know.

652
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,587
I guess not.

653
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,007
You don't know if Fuushin
is actually there.

654
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:14,678
But I'm rooting for you.
Good luck!

655
00:50:15,277 --> 00:50:19,740
We need to get rid of nuisances like
Exploding Humans as soon as possible.

656
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:21,601
That's unusual.

657
00:50:21,626 --> 00:50:25,171
I didn't expect to hear that from
a weapons trader like yourself.

658
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:28,316
If a convenient explosive like
that became commonplace,

659
00:50:28,341 --> 00:50:31,928
I'd be forced to shut down
my business.

660
00:50:53,872 --> 00:50:55,748
Just as guilty...

661
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:57,262
That's what you said.

662
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:58,346
Huh?

663
00:50:59,786 --> 00:51:03,999
<i>To a victim, the assailant and
a third party are no different.</i>

664
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:09,503
<i>People are no better than the assailant
if they didn't try to help.</i>

665
00:51:10,766 --> 00:51:14,901
<i>If you only pity the loser</i>

666
00:51:15,171 --> 00:51:19,634
<i>and do nothing to stop
the decadence of the rich...</i>

667
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:21,578
<i>you're just as guilty, Sasuke.</i>

668
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:24,570
It's just as you said.

669
00:51:25,686 --> 00:51:26,590
But...

670
00:51:27,837 --> 00:51:28,777
"But"?

671
00:51:29,432 --> 00:51:31,893
No, never mind.

672
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:57,239
Hey, you probably won't tell me...

673
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:59,116
But I'll ask anyway.

674
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,785
Where are you headed this time?

675
00:52:02,546 --> 00:52:03,797
Hell Valley.

676
00:52:03,855 --> 00:52:06,566
See? You didn't tell me...

677
00:52:07,095 --> 00:52:09,097
What? Hell Valley?!

678
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:12,629
The one making Exploding Humans
is there?

679
00:52:14,029 --> 00:52:15,613
Probably not.

680
00:52:16,021 --> 00:52:18,356
Then why are you going?

681
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:22,305
I want to see this Hell Valley
with my own eyes.

682
00:52:24,758 --> 00:52:28,603
As the last survivor
of the Uchiha Clan.

683
00:52:45,168 --> 00:52:46,461
Huh?!

684
00:52:46,737 --> 00:52:48,890
We came all the way here
to the Land of Steam,

685
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:51,781
and we're not going to soak
in the hot springs?

686
00:52:54,178 --> 00:52:56,014
You two can do
whatever you want.

687
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:57,841
This is where we go
our separate ways.

688
00:52:58,049 --> 00:53:00,302
But why?

689
00:53:00,698 --> 00:53:05,411
The one making
the Exploding Humans is after me.

690
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:09,019
It's better if
you're not around me.

691
00:53:09,758 --> 00:53:11,719
We came all the way here together.

692
00:53:11,744 --> 00:53:14,205
As if we'd desert you now,
Sasuke.

693
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:17,944
We're going with you
to Hell Valley!

694
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:51,436
Exploding Humans!

695
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:52,687
Sasuke!

696
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:54,147
Stay away!

697
00:53:55,874 --> 00:53:58,835
Nowaki, let go!

698
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:43,421
<i>He's...</i>

699
00:54:44,018 --> 00:54:45,555
<i>not cloaked in chakra.</i>

700
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:05,093
Hot! So hot...!

701
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:06,511
Hot! So hot!

702
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,814
You're not Fuushin, are you?

703
00:55:18,937 --> 00:55:20,730
Wh-What are you saying?

704
00:55:20,755 --> 00:55:22,210
I'm the Lightning Gang's...

705
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:24,029
I possess the Sharingan.

706
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:28,700
I can look into
your memories with this.

707
00:55:29,529 --> 00:55:33,074
If you're lying, I can't guarantee
that I'll spare you.

708
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,666
Fine.

709
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:44,007
Won't guarantee my life?

710
00:55:44,426 --> 00:55:47,705
Well, I'll say it right back at you!

711
00:55:48,521 --> 00:55:50,565
Whoa... I won't let you.

712
00:55:51,029 --> 00:55:52,739
<i>Earth Style: Mud Wall!</i>

713
00:55:54,507 --> 00:55:56,175
<i>Lava Style: Rubber Wall!</i>

714
00:56:04,721 --> 00:56:07,390
Rubber is strong against
the Lightning Style!

715
00:56:09,964 --> 00:56:12,028
<i>Lava Style: Rubber Sphere!</i>

716
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,542
All right...

717
00:56:20,178 --> 00:56:21,477
Let's do this!

718
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:24,672
It starts now!

719
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:31,554
What?!

720
00:56:31,934 --> 00:56:34,029
Then I'll just increase the amount!

721
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:36,559
<i>Amaterasu.</i>

722
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:42,023
Wh-What the hell is this?!

723
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:44,959
I-It won't go out!

724
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:46,903
Hot! Hot!

725
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:48,947
I-I'll tell you anything you want!

726
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:52,475
I'll talk! Please let me talk!

727
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,877
So please put out the flames!

728
00:56:55,007 --> 00:56:56,008
Hot! Hot!

729
00:56:56,182 --> 00:56:57,838
Kagutsuchi...

730
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:06,131
You don't have to talk.

731
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:20,228
<i>"I need your help... Fuushin."</i>

732
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:23,356
<i>Just hold on, Boss!</i>

733
00:57:26,315 --> 00:57:29,201
<i>So you want me to make
this Sasuke guy think</i>

734
00:57:29,226 --> 00:57:30,936
<i>that I'm after him?</i>

735
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:49,527
I figured as much.

736
00:57:51,729 --> 00:57:52,766
That's right.

737
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:56,514
That chakra sword was

738
00:57:56,778 --> 00:57:59,962
the same as the chakra sword
you threw at me at Bamboo Village.

739
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:05,482
Show me what you really look like...

740
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,442
"Really look like"?

741
00:58:07,713 --> 00:58:10,410
That's not your real appearance.

742
00:58:11,011 --> 00:58:12,267
Otherwise,

743
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:16,362
you wouldn't have shown yourself
before Old Man Iou in the Bamboo Village.

744
00:58:17,323 --> 00:58:21,169
Still, were you that scared
to see En Oyashiro?

745
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:54,365
Indeed... This is how I really look.

746
00:58:56,206 --> 00:58:57,214
Fuushin!

747
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:03,164
You're going to tell me
everything I want to know.

748
00:59:03,977 --> 00:59:05,061
I wonder if you can make me?

749
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,294
<i>Severe Wind Destruction!</i>

750
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,495
<i>Severe Wind Destruction!</i>

751
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:18,781
This isn't over yet!

752
01:00:47,215 --> 01:00:48,425
There's no wind.

753
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:50,188
So this is the eye of the storm!

754
01:01:11,758 --> 01:01:13,422
Now, tell me everything.

755
01:01:15,619 --> 01:01:16,548
No way.

756
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:19,676
Damn it!

757
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:38,152
<i>What's that?</i>

758
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:48,246
<i>Don't think I'll fall for
the same trick twice!</i>

759
01:03:03,654 --> 01:03:05,406
So this is Hell Valley...

760
01:03:16,389 --> 01:03:19,850
The Chinoike Clan really lived here?

761
01:03:21,333 --> 01:03:22,755
Yes, we did.

762
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:27,012
Take a good, long look.

763
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:33,275
That's proof people lived here.

764
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:36,687
False suspicion was cast on them

765
01:03:36,712 --> 01:03:40,507
and the Uchiha Clan forced them
all the way here.

766
01:03:41,048 --> 01:03:43,133
The clan had no choice
but to settle here.

767
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:46,489
They drank this scalding water,

768
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:48,658
hunted down whatever birds
they could that flew past...

769
01:03:48,683 --> 01:03:51,602
ate the meager grass that grew
in the soil in order to survive.

770
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:54,038
Weary of fighting,

771
01:03:54,121 --> 01:03:56,465
the clan never ventured out
into the outside world,

772
01:03:56,490 --> 01:03:58,909
and scraped out a living,
so I've heard.

773
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:00,962
"So I've heard"?

774
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:04,411
By the time I was old enough
to understand,

775
01:04:04,672 --> 01:04:06,558
I was already living
in Oyashiro's mansion.

776
01:04:08,427 --> 01:04:12,348
I was told Oyashiro kidnapped me
from Hell Valley... just me.

777
01:04:13,261 --> 01:04:15,373
You were all alone?

778
01:04:22,978 --> 01:04:24,313
You were all by yourself?

779
01:04:25,183 --> 01:04:27,352
What? You're actually interested?

780
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:28,990
How unlike you.

781
01:04:30,324 --> 01:04:32,618
Then let me show you.

782
01:04:43,504 --> 01:04:46,215
<i>I was the only one from
the Chinoike Clan.</i>

783
01:04:47,053 --> 01:04:51,867
<i>But there were lots of kids like me
at Oyashiro's mansion</i>

784
01:04:52,489 --> 01:04:55,117
<i>and we were all forced to train
to become shinobi.</i>

785
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:04,567
What's the matter?

786
01:05:04,934 --> 01:05:07,812
If you don't win, you'll go hungry.

787
01:05:53,671 --> 01:05:55,465
You did well, Chino.

788
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:13,469
<i>And on that day,
Oyashiro brought me to...</i>

789
01:06:14,407 --> 01:06:15,909
<i>the Coliseum.</i>

790
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:20,935
Representing President Kusabi
of Kusabi Real Estate Company

791
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,001
and currently on
a record-setting run of no losses!

792
01:06:23,026 --> 01:06:25,450
The Hurricane Kid
who has no mercy...

793
01:06:26,204 --> 01:06:27,722
Fuushin!

794
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:29,918
And going up against him...

795
01:06:29,943 --> 01:06:32,529
representing En Oyashiro,
who returns after a long absence...

796
01:06:32,752 --> 01:06:34,639
The Beauty of the Ketsuryugan...

797
01:06:35,017 --> 01:06:36,284
Chino!

798
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:39,286
I've never heard of
the Ketsuryugan.

799
01:06:39,311 --> 01:06:42,105
Just what kind of power is it?!

800
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:46,168
It seems like our audience
is very curious too!

801
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:51,465
And now, let's begin!

802
01:06:51,490 --> 01:06:52,881
Ready...

803
01:06:53,217 --> 01:06:55,136
Fight!

804
01:07:00,474 --> 01:07:04,061
If you're so eager,
I'll show you my Ketsuryugan.

805
01:07:04,228 --> 01:07:06,772
I'll blow you away before
you have the chance.

806
01:07:10,585 --> 01:07:12,482
<i>Typhoon Style:
High Wind Destruction!</i>

807
01:07:32,402 --> 01:07:35,443
Whoa... What's this?!

808
01:07:35,801 --> 01:07:39,030
Fuushin's just been standing there!

809
01:07:40,705 --> 01:07:43,291
What's wrong, Fuushin?!

810
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:51,025
Did I... just lose?

811
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:54,320
Yeah, you lost.

812
01:07:59,694 --> 01:08:01,853
Can you believe this?!

813
01:08:01,878 --> 01:08:07,926
The one and only Fuushin has lost to
a young girl in her debut match!

814
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:21,555
There we go.

815
01:08:23,567 --> 01:08:25,027
You're really strong!

816
01:08:25,102 --> 01:08:26,075
Are you being sarcastic?

817
01:08:26,143 --> 01:08:28,145
N-No way!

818
01:08:29,921 --> 01:08:31,631
My eyes are...

819
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:34,401
S-See... They're special, so...

820
01:08:36,569 --> 01:08:37,832
Special, huh?

821
01:08:39,218 --> 01:08:42,680
Anyone who possesses
a Kekkei Genkai is special.

822
01:08:46,587 --> 01:08:48,338
Because of this power,

823
01:08:48,363 --> 01:08:51,116
people feared me
and kept their distance.

824
01:08:51,267 --> 01:08:53,728
At times, I was shunned
and treated cruelly.

825
01:08:55,815 --> 01:08:58,818
Even having a past like that
was better than what I had.

826
01:09:00,697 --> 01:09:01,990
What do you mean?

827
01:09:03,362 --> 01:09:07,282
For as long as I can remember,
I've been here.

828
01:09:07,624 --> 01:09:11,628
I have no memory about
anything before I came here.

829
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:14,233
I see.

830
01:09:16,236 --> 01:09:18,196
You're fortunate.

831
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:21,860
Me? Fortunate?!

832
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:27,454
Having memories you don't want
to remember is pointless.

833
01:09:30,519 --> 01:09:32,396
I was born in the Land of Water.

834
01:09:33,227 --> 01:09:37,397
But it wasn't on the mainland
where the Hidden Mist Village is.

835
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:39,633
I was born on
a poverty-stricken island nearby.

836
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:43,513
And...

837
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:45,498
Because of this power,

838
01:09:45,523 --> 01:09:48,359
I was blamed for a typhoon
that struck the island.

839
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:50,197
They wanted to get rid of me,

840
01:09:50,326 --> 01:09:54,497
so I was sold off to a rich man
named Kusabi.

841
01:09:56,318 --> 01:09:58,332
All I remember about Kusabi's place...

842
01:09:58,554 --> 01:10:02,057
was the constant torture
even when I was obedient.

843
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:06,243
But I wasn't averse to fighting
in the Coliseum.

844
01:10:06,785 --> 01:10:10,331
Because I was able to
demonstrate my strength there.

845
01:10:11,578 --> 01:10:15,124
And still, I lost to a brat like you.

846
01:10:16,492 --> 01:10:18,119
I'm sorry I won.

847
01:10:19,506 --> 01:10:20,633
You better be!

848
01:10:24,178 --> 01:10:27,514
Still, I envy you.

849
01:10:28,408 --> 01:10:30,952
I don't know what
my mom or dad look like.

850
01:10:31,036 --> 01:10:33,038
I don't know why I was born...

851
01:10:33,159 --> 01:10:35,119
or even why I'm alive.

852
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:38,294
I don't have anything!

853
01:10:39,842 --> 01:10:42,505
I don't care how terrible
any past might be.

854
01:10:42,904 --> 01:10:45,063
It's better than being
empty like me!

855
01:10:48,258 --> 01:10:49,218
I...

856
01:10:50,474 --> 01:10:52,101
I just said some terrible things.

857
01:10:53,009 --> 01:10:55,428
But that's how I feel.

858
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:56,961
Sorry.

859
01:11:00,005 --> 01:11:01,799
I don't know why, but...

860
01:11:03,533 --> 01:11:06,994
This is first time I've spoken
about myself to anyone else...

861
01:11:07,871 --> 01:11:11,106
and the first time someone's tears
have actually moved me.

862
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:18,202
<i>In the end, we were both assigned
to Oyashiro's guard unit...</i>

863
01:11:18,287 --> 01:11:20,581
<i>and we started working.</i>

864
01:11:23,654 --> 01:11:27,574
<i>And one day, we found it
at the Oyashiro mansion.</i>

865
01:11:28,670 --> 01:11:30,005
Look, Chino!

866
01:11:31,230 --> 01:11:35,108
<i>An old historical document
about the Chinoike Clan.</i>

867
01:11:41,588 --> 01:11:42,589
Let's go, Chino.

868
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:43,966
Huh?!

869
01:11:44,008 --> 01:11:45,481
If we go to Hell Valley,

870
01:11:45,506 --> 01:11:47,967
we may find some of your kin
from the Chinoike Clan.

871
01:11:48,298 --> 01:11:50,175
And we might find something
regarding your past!

872
01:11:50,227 --> 01:11:53,438
If you go to Hell Valley,
you won't feel so empty anymore.

873
01:11:54,529 --> 01:11:57,574
But there's no way
Oyashiro will allow it.

874
01:11:58,022 --> 01:11:59,648
We don't need his permission!

875
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:07,884
<i>Fuushin and I gathered others</i>

876
01:12:07,909 --> 01:12:13,354
<i>who wanted to get out of
Oyashiro's mansion and escaped.</i>

877
01:12:16,364 --> 01:12:17,908
We're all free now!

878
01:12:18,355 --> 01:12:21,191
<i>And we ran towards Hell Valley.</i>

879
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:23,502
<i>But...</i>

880
01:12:26,383 --> 01:12:27,718
Hey...

881
01:12:27,857 --> 01:12:32,016
You get to live by selling
these crude bamboo knick-knacks.

882
01:12:32,153 --> 01:12:33,821
Who do you owe that all to?

883
01:12:34,011 --> 01:12:37,014
Why, we owe it all to you, my lord.

884
01:12:37,124 --> 01:12:38,063
Silence!

885
01:12:38,088 --> 01:12:38,917
Father!

886
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:42,941
This is hardly enough!

887
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:46,612
– So... I'll take your daughter in exchange.
– Are you okay, Father?!

888
01:12:47,237 --> 01:12:48,614
Amino!

889
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:53,994
Wh-Who are you?!

890
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:58,624
If you don't want to get hurt,
get lost.

891
01:12:58,707 --> 01:13:00,584
Y-Yes...

892
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:02,169
Hurry, grab him!

893
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:05,130
S-Sir...

894
01:13:06,006 --> 01:13:08,550
Th-Thank you for saving me.

895
01:13:08,575 --> 01:13:09,701
Think nothing of it.

896
01:13:09,843 --> 01:13:11,512
We just happened to see
what was going on.

897
01:13:11,537 --> 01:13:13,456
Where are you
chivalrous thieves from?

898
01:13:13,597 --> 01:13:14,598
Chivalrous thieves?

899
01:13:14,848 --> 01:13:18,894
P-Please! Please continue
to protect us!

900
01:13:21,313 --> 01:13:23,941
<i>We were hailed
as chivalrous thieves.</i>

901
01:13:23,966 --> 01:13:25,897
<i>So we adopted the name,
the Lightning Gang</i>

902
01:13:25,922 --> 01:13:28,216
<i>and worked for
the sake of nearby villages.</i>

903
01:13:28,817 --> 01:13:30,709
<i>We were treated like heroes.</i>

904
01:13:31,388 --> 01:13:35,346
<i>Every time we appeared,
the villagers welcomed us.</i>

905
01:13:36,093 --> 01:13:38,615
<i>They gave us food and shelter.</i>

906
01:13:39,206 --> 01:13:40,707
<i>Everyone was kind.</i>

907
01:13:41,472 --> 01:13:44,767
Sorry that we haven't been
able to go to Hell Valley.

908
01:13:46,171 --> 01:13:47,589
That's okay.

909
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:50,092
I can go to Hell Valley anytime.

910
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:52,970
For now, let's work hard
for these people.

911
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:58,154
<i>We owed allegiance to no one,
others were at our mercy.</i>

912
01:13:58,470 --> 01:14:01,473
<i>Seeing this, some shinobi villages
tried to use us.</i>

913
01:14:03,164 --> 01:14:05,917
<i>During the reign of
the previous Mizukage,</i>

914
01:14:06,191 --> 01:14:09,111
<i>the Hidden Mist were
our valued clients.</i>

915
01:14:12,019 --> 01:14:13,516
<i>That same thing happened then.</i>

916
01:14:13,927 --> 01:14:15,690
<i>We went after a Feudal Lord</i>

917
01:14:15,852 --> 01:14:18,313
<i>who was taking money
from the unfortunate.</i>

918
01:14:19,079 --> 01:14:21,380
Oh come on. What's the matter?

919
01:14:21,405 --> 01:14:22,521
You mustn't, my lord.

920
01:14:25,252 --> 01:14:27,296
A-Are you the infamous—?!

921
01:14:27,321 --> 01:14:29,031
Yeah, we're the Lightning Gang.

922
01:14:29,350 --> 01:14:30,103
Get him.

923
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:33,256
W-Wait... please.

924
01:14:33,316 --> 01:14:35,484
As long as you pay up,
we won't hurt you.

925
01:14:36,051 --> 01:14:37,238
That's as far as you'll go.

926
01:14:40,684 --> 01:14:41,935
Shinobi...?!

927
01:14:43,301 --> 01:14:44,344
The Hidden Mist?!

928
01:14:44,771 --> 01:14:47,301
I see... You want to get rid of us.
And not only that,

929
01:14:47,326 --> 01:14:50,472
you intend to create a direct relationship
with the Feudal Lord.

930
01:14:50,497 --> 01:14:52,207
Th-Thank you for saving me.

931
01:14:52,405 --> 01:14:53,531
You're correct.

932
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:03,749
<i>It's horrible, isn't it?</i>

933
01:15:04,022 --> 01:15:06,590
<i>But, what's worse was...</i>

934
01:15:16,465 --> 01:15:18,842
Just for a while...
Let us rest here.

935
01:15:19,701 --> 01:15:21,078
Please go somewhere else.

936
01:15:21,347 --> 01:15:22,056
What?

937
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:26,813
If we harbor you,
we'll end up paying dearly for it!

938
01:15:27,338 --> 01:15:30,549
We have no intentions
of troubling the village!

939
01:15:31,038 --> 01:15:32,415
We'll leave right away!

940
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:35,614
Just because you take money
from others and give it away,

941
01:15:35,739 --> 01:15:38,575
don't think you can do
whatever you want!

942
01:15:40,661 --> 01:15:41,870
<i>Every village was the same.</i>

943
01:15:41,895 --> 01:15:44,356
<i>They wouldn't even give us water.</i>

944
01:15:46,622 --> 01:15:50,501
<i>One by one,
our wounded comrades died.</i>

945
01:15:51,443 --> 01:15:54,487
<i>Eventually, it was just
Fuushin and me.</i>

946
01:15:58,902 --> 01:16:01,572
There's nowhere else we can go.

947
01:16:03,102 --> 01:16:04,145
Yes, there is.

948
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:04,902
Huh?

949
01:16:05,730 --> 01:16:11,235
<i>So we... finally made it
to Hell Valley.</i>

950
01:16:24,709 --> 01:16:26,717
I'm empty, after all.

951
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:27,608
Chino?!

952
01:16:28,393 --> 01:16:30,436
I can't remember anything!

953
01:16:30,494 --> 01:16:32,955
My father, my mother...

954
01:16:32,980 --> 01:16:34,941
I can't remember anyone's faces!

955
01:16:35,816 --> 01:16:38,616
Coming here didn't solve anything,
after all.

956
01:16:38,641 --> 01:16:42,061
I still don't know why
I was born or why I'm alive!

957
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:47,686
Pursuers from the Hidden Mist!

958
01:16:53,066 --> 01:16:53,792
Chino!

959
01:16:57,645 --> 01:16:58,477
Chino!

960
01:17:01,825 --> 01:17:03,994
Let go, you damn—!

961
01:17:04,661 --> 01:17:05,746
Owww!

962
01:17:06,698 --> 01:17:07,618
Chino...!

963
01:17:13,545 --> 01:17:14,921
Wh-What the hell is this?!

964
01:17:15,977 --> 01:17:16,865
What's wrong?

965
01:17:19,676 --> 01:17:20,761
Chino!

966
01:17:29,474 --> 01:17:30,475
Chino!

967
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,226
Chino, are you all right?

968
01:17:34,524 --> 01:17:37,277
I... didn't know I could do this.

969
01:17:39,029 --> 01:17:43,033
So... that was the true power
of the Chinoike Clan?

970
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:47,663
I'll get my revenge!

971
01:18:01,558 --> 01:18:04,700
You were going to use that to
get revenge against the Uchiha

972
01:18:04,725 --> 01:18:08,062
who forced the Chinoike Clan
to Hell Valley?

973
01:18:10,595 --> 01:18:13,264
So I was your target
from the very start.

974
01:18:13,808 --> 01:18:16,608
If I sent Exploding Humans
to the Hidden Leaf Village,

975
01:18:16,633 --> 01:18:18,426
then you were sure to return.

976
01:18:18,884 --> 01:18:22,507
I planned to kill you and
the entire Leaf Village, but...

977
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:26,827
You happened to meet me
at Bamboo Village, is that it?

978
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:29,913
Coincidence is a scary thing,
don't you think?

979
01:18:30,698 --> 01:18:34,243
We attacked that village just to
get back at them for the last time...

980
01:18:36,741 --> 01:18:41,663
Meeting you there was
the last thing we expected.

981
01:18:43,207 --> 01:18:44,052
But thanks to

982
01:18:44,077 --> 01:18:47,677
the head of the Bamboo Village's
interesting parting words,

983
01:18:47,951 --> 01:18:49,905
we changed our plans.

984
01:18:51,574 --> 01:18:54,869
<i>I'll never forgive you...
Fuushin!</i>

985
01:18:57,538 --> 01:19:00,444
I happened to be looking for Fuushin,
so you joined up with me and

986
01:19:00,611 --> 01:19:03,614
used your Exploding Humans whenever
something happened as a diversion.

987
01:19:03,714 --> 01:19:08,427
And Nowaki, rather Fuushin, would come
after me with his chakra sword.

988
01:19:09,596 --> 01:19:11,513
And just in case
you couldn't kill me,

989
01:19:11,538 --> 01:19:16,006
you went so far as to ask an old partner
to stand by and pretend to be Fuushin.

990
01:19:17,371 --> 01:19:19,916
So what now?
Are you going to kill me?

991
01:19:21,352 --> 01:19:25,135
You and me... We're the last ones from
the Chinoike and Uchiha Clans.

992
01:19:26,081 --> 01:19:28,204
Let's put it all on the line

993
01:19:29,473 --> 01:19:30,974
and fight to the death!

994
01:19:32,045 --> 01:19:34,847
Unfortunately,
I'm not interested in that.

995
01:19:36,677 --> 01:19:38,262
You're the same as usual...

996
01:19:38,648 --> 01:19:41,359
But don't think
you can go around

997
01:19:41,384 --> 01:19:43,678
with that aloof expression
on your face forever.

998
01:19:45,238 --> 01:19:49,743
The Chinoike Clan uses blood
to handle all kinds of jutsu.

999
01:19:52,078 --> 01:19:53,997
And here in this location...

1000
01:19:55,265 --> 01:19:58,643
this red lake with
its high iron content...

1001
01:19:58,668 --> 01:20:02,047
will make the power of
the Chinoike even stronger!

1002
01:20:15,685 --> 01:20:16,544
What?!

1003
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:20,527
Take this!

1004
01:20:33,787 --> 01:20:34,510
Go!

1005
01:21:14,661 --> 01:21:16,079
Do you still want to continue?

1006
01:21:28,829 --> 01:21:30,411
Chakra is entering
from my wound?!

1007
01:21:34,476 --> 01:21:35,365
What?!

1008
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:39,603
My chakra seals the wound
and waits.

1009
01:21:39,791 --> 01:21:40,917
Waits for what?

1010
01:21:41,688 --> 01:21:43,064
Isn't it obvious?

1011
01:22:15,305 --> 01:22:17,849
Goodbye, Sasuke Uchiha.

1012
01:22:28,043 --> 01:22:30,796
<i>So that's how you made
the Exploding Humans?</i>

1013
01:22:34,699 --> 01:22:35,825
<i>The Sharingan?!</i>

1014
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:51,591
I envied you, Sasuke.

1015
01:22:53,234 --> 01:22:55,403
You were born in
the Hidden Leaf Village

1016
01:22:55,428 --> 01:22:57,138
and bore the Uchiha name...

1017
01:22:57,968 --> 01:23:00,178
and you had a family
that loved you.

1018
01:23:01,726 --> 01:23:05,438
When you deserted your village,
you and your reputation were notorious.

1019
01:23:05,722 --> 01:23:08,057
But even now,
you're allowed to travel freely.

1020
01:23:09,904 --> 01:23:14,951
That's because you have people
who love and protect you.

1021
01:23:20,263 --> 01:23:21,663
I know...

1022
01:23:22,997 --> 01:23:29,253
You've always, always had someone
who kept loving you, no matter what.

1023
01:23:30,422 --> 01:23:33,550
You're not like me...
I've been alone from the beginning!

1024
01:23:34,997 --> 01:23:37,303
<i>You've been alone
from the beginning!</i>

1025
01:23:37,804 --> 01:23:42,684
<i>How the hell do you think
you understand?</i>

1026
01:23:43,168 --> 01:23:45,895
<i>It's because I have these ties,
that I feel this agony.</i>

1027
01:23:45,979 --> 01:23:48,398
<i>How could you
possibly understand</i>

1028
01:23:48,481 --> 01:23:50,984
<i>what it feels like to lose all that?!</i>

1029
01:23:51,776 --> 01:23:53,319
So...

1030
01:23:54,738 --> 01:23:58,366
So why do you fight for
the Hidden Leaf?!

1031
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:01,119
The leaves of the Hidden Leaf
are brilliant,

1032
01:24:01,144 --> 01:24:02,604
but its roots are black!

1033
01:24:02,746 --> 01:24:05,165
There is light and darkness
in the Hidden Leaf!

1034
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:10,837
Your clan was used up and absorbed
by the Leaf's roots as nourishment!

1035
01:24:11,285 --> 01:24:13,954
So why do you go so far for them?!

1036
01:24:13,979 --> 01:24:15,680
Because I'm alive.

1037
01:24:17,245 --> 01:24:18,311
What do you mean?

1038
01:24:18,845 --> 01:24:20,722
I have a friend who saved me.

1039
01:24:22,375 --> 01:24:25,643
A friend with whom I can share
my pain, and him, with me.

1040
01:24:27,646 --> 01:24:31,816
His wish is that one day
the world will be like us.

1041
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:36,486
A world like that is impossible.

1042
01:24:39,485 --> 01:24:42,155
That's just wishful thinking!

1043
01:24:45,622 --> 01:24:48,083
That's why he wants to
make it real!

1044
01:24:50,514 --> 01:24:54,685
And it's that hopeful heart that
connects me to the Hidden Leaf!

1045
01:24:55,715 --> 01:24:57,717
To be like my older brother...

1046
01:24:58,176 --> 01:25:02,097
and support this world from
the shadows, and...

1047
01:25:03,064 --> 01:25:04,148
And?

1048
01:25:05,416 --> 01:25:09,003
And look beyond this world...
to the light!

1049
01:25:10,508 --> 01:25:12,760
I don't want to see such a world!

1050
01:25:13,349 --> 01:25:15,610
Enough already! Kill me!

1051
01:25:15,693 --> 01:25:17,237
Hurry and kill me!

1052
01:25:17,403 --> 01:25:18,079
Chino!

1053
01:25:23,079 --> 01:25:24,410
Fuushin!

1054
01:25:30,044 --> 01:25:31,055
Fuushin!

1055
01:25:36,005 --> 01:25:36,965
Fuushin?!

1056
01:25:37,090 --> 01:25:38,675
What are you doing here?

1057
01:25:43,282 --> 01:25:44,203
Fuushin?

1058
01:25:49,409 --> 01:25:53,914
Now, you should be able to understand
the meaning of my words.

1059
01:25:55,549 --> 01:25:57,760
<i>I have a friend who saved me.</i>

1060
01:25:58,895 --> 01:26:02,482
<i>A friend with whom I can share
my pain, and him, with me.</i>

1061
01:26:10,270 --> 01:26:13,189
If you're going to kill someone,
kill me.

1062
01:26:23,561 --> 01:26:26,522
Fuushin, it's okay.

1063
01:26:28,537 --> 01:26:29,684
It's okay.

1064
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:40,278
I'd be in pain... if you died.

1065
01:26:42,759 --> 01:26:43,753
Chino...

1066
01:26:48,577 --> 01:26:52,789
Sasuke, I wish I didn't meet you
at Bamboo Village.

1067
01:26:54,248 --> 01:26:58,335
Then I could have kept
on hating you.

1068
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:08,806
Also, I want to see
this world that you speak of...

1069
01:27:16,596 --> 01:27:17,889
This is the last one...

1070
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:22,519
It's penetrated the brachial artery.

1071
01:27:30,752 --> 01:27:31,795
We're good now.

1072
01:27:31,933 --> 01:27:35,478
There's no more unusual chakra
flowing inside of him now.

1073
01:27:38,988 --> 01:27:39,989
Thank you.

1074
01:27:41,058 --> 01:27:44,603
What would I have done
without you?

1075
01:27:46,334 --> 01:27:49,129
I think it's all because of
your exceptional skill, Sakura!

1076
01:27:51,210 --> 01:27:54,801
The ringleader was turned over to
the authorities last night, right?

1077
01:27:55,091 --> 01:27:55,907
Yes.

1078
01:27:56,344 --> 01:27:58,055
Was Sasuke there?

1079
01:27:58,847 --> 01:28:00,390
I thought he would be.

1080
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:04,776
But they asked the Leaf shinobi to go over
to the Land of Steam to take custody.

1081
01:28:05,426 --> 01:28:08,471
The one who captured
the ringleader didn't return...

1082
01:28:20,577 --> 01:28:21,828
Hello.

1083
01:28:25,638 --> 01:28:27,140
I'm the perpetrator.

1084
01:28:28,210 --> 01:28:30,045
I take all responsibility.

1085
01:28:30,194 --> 01:28:33,906
So please go easy on the other two.

1086
01:28:34,326 --> 01:28:37,469
Chino, that's not what we want.

1087
01:28:37,552 --> 01:28:39,554
That's right, Miss Chino!

1088
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:40,447
I–!

1089
01:28:40,472 --> 01:28:42,599
Now calm down...

1090
01:28:42,782 --> 01:28:45,535
Actually, the Mizukage of
the Hidden Mist

1091
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:48,021
wants to take custody of you.

1092
01:28:48,594 --> 01:28:50,596
Wh-Why?

1093
01:28:51,193 --> 01:28:54,905
Now's the only time to stop
the chain of negativity.

1094
01:28:56,008 --> 01:28:57,051
Please come in.

1095
01:29:01,368 --> 01:29:03,261
Let's skip the greetings.

1096
01:29:03,344 --> 01:29:07,682
I'd once heard about your past connection
to the Hidden Mist.

1097
01:29:07,807 --> 01:29:08,600
Huh?

1098
01:29:08,758 --> 01:29:11,761
If it's okay with you...

1099
01:29:12,694 --> 01:29:15,979
I'd like you to help
the Hidden Mist.

1100
01:29:16,424 --> 01:29:18,760
Wh-Why?

1101
01:29:19,177 --> 01:29:23,849
You must atone for what you did
for the rest of your lives.

1102
01:29:24,822 --> 01:29:30,230
But every shinobi, great and small,
must bear the same burden.

1103
01:29:31,719 --> 01:29:33,137
I'm no different.

1104
01:29:35,816 --> 01:29:39,820
Would you like to fight again...
with your own life?

1105
01:29:42,450 --> 01:29:46,746
And, there's another thing
I need to let you know.

1106
01:29:48,248 --> 01:29:49,837
Around now, he's...

1107
01:29:56,131 --> 01:29:58,592
Wh-What is this...!

1108
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,719
The last Uchiha...

1109
01:30:00,744 --> 01:30:05,082
a.k.a. Sasuke Uchiha has
returned to the Coliseum!

1110
01:30:07,434 --> 01:30:09,060
<i>To a victim,</i>

1111
01:30:09,144 --> 01:30:11,646
<i>the assailant and a third party
are no different.</i>

1112
01:30:13,889 --> 01:30:16,126
<i>People are no better than
the assailant</i>

1113
01:30:16,151 --> 01:30:17,903
<i>if they didn't try to help.</i>

1114
01:30:18,146 --> 01:30:20,280
<i>If you only pity the loser
and do nothing</i>

1115
01:30:20,305 --> 01:30:22,391
<i>to stop the decadence of the rich...</i>

1116
01:30:22,617 --> 01:30:24,619
<i>you're just as guilty, Sasuke.</i>

1117
01:30:26,237 --> 01:30:28,622
I will welcome all challenges!

1118
01:30:28,705 --> 01:30:31,958
And I will free all shinobi!

1119
01:30:32,542 --> 01:30:36,129
If you desire the Uchiha's eye,
come and get it!

1120
01:30:36,421 --> 01:30:37,631
Sasuke is—?!

1121
01:30:38,965 --> 01:30:42,093
But there are many shinobi
with Kekkei Genkai there!

1122
01:30:42,235 --> 01:30:44,112
Even someone like Sasuke...

1123
01:30:44,137 --> 01:30:46,139
Don't underestimate Sasuke!

1124
01:30:49,643 --> 01:30:52,854
Sasuke's probably doing this
for your sake.

1125
01:30:53,436 --> 01:30:55,688
So he will never, ever lose!

1126
01:30:57,776 --> 01:30:59,450
So you're Sasuke's?

1127
01:31:00,921 --> 01:31:03,340
Yeah, I'm his friend.

1128
01:31:03,365 --> 01:31:05,116
I'm Naruto Uzumaki.

1129
01:31:06,542 --> 01:31:10,463
Your friend saved me.

1130
01:31:11,414 --> 01:31:12,832
I'm very grateful.

1131
01:31:15,377 --> 01:31:16,586
I see!

1132
01:31:27,530 --> 01:31:31,284
Th-This is something
no one's ever imagined!

1133
01:31:31,309 --> 01:31:34,521
Sasuke Uchiha has beaten
each and every shinobi!

1134
01:31:34,604 --> 01:31:38,608
Which means, he has acquired
every single shinobi!

1135
01:31:43,939 --> 01:31:46,616
What's going to happen to us?

1136
01:31:47,344 --> 01:31:49,305
The Hidden Cloud will take you in.

1137
01:31:49,494 --> 01:31:50,704
The Hidden Cloud?

1138
01:31:50,939 --> 01:31:52,774
Indeed!

1139
01:31:53,857 --> 01:31:57,375
We, the Hidden Cloud, will
safeguard all shinobi!

1140
01:31:58,044 --> 01:32:03,091
At the same time, everyone who took part
in the illegal gambling here

1141
01:32:03,316 --> 01:32:04,614
will be taken into custody.

1142
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:14,352
This is so dull.

1143
01:32:14,519 --> 01:32:16,438
This isn't looking good.

1144
01:32:18,106 --> 01:32:20,338
I'm here, kid.

1145
01:32:29,388 --> 01:32:30,723
I'm grateful.

1146
01:32:30,748 --> 01:32:33,709
Be grateful to your Lord Sixth.

1147
01:32:33,997 --> 01:32:35,796
– He came and insisted...
– Hurry and come here!

1148
01:32:35,821 --> 01:32:38,156
That this island
was close to my village,

1149
01:32:38,585 --> 01:32:40,687
and that it was the Cloud's business
to deal with it.

1150
01:32:41,046 --> 01:32:43,340
That's why we're here...

1151
01:32:43,423 --> 01:32:44,424
So dull...

1152
01:32:45,765 --> 01:32:47,294
Long ago,

1153
01:32:47,889 --> 01:32:51,851
Naruto put his hands together
and passionately argued for you.

1154
01:32:53,784 --> 01:32:55,894
It was the time you kidnapped
my kid brother, Bee,

1155
01:32:55,894 --> 01:32:58,438
and Danzo agreed to our request

1156
01:32:58,463 --> 01:33:00,924
to mark you a rogue ninja
and assassinate you.

1157
01:33:02,150 --> 01:33:07,006
<i>I want you to cancel
the disposal of Sasuke Uchiha!</i>

1158
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:09,924
<i>I'm begging you!</i>

1159
01:33:09,949 --> 01:33:13,244
<i>I don't want us killing each other
for revenge anymore!</i>

1160
01:33:20,585 --> 01:33:23,546
I'm glad we didn't kill you
back then.

1161
01:33:25,340 --> 01:33:30,095
Know yourself and know others,
and never alter your path again.

1162
01:33:30,986 --> 01:33:35,567
Feel the significance of why
you can walk this world freely.

1163
01:33:36,184 --> 01:33:39,854
And create a reason to
convince others around you.

1164
01:33:43,233 --> 01:33:47,153
Perhaps with this incident,
you just created one.

1165
01:33:47,436 --> 01:33:50,189
But just one won't be enough.

1166
01:33:56,429 --> 01:33:58,556
You weren't caught?

1167
01:33:59,249 --> 01:34:00,834
I'm here, aren't I?

1168
01:34:01,251 --> 01:34:03,337
Did things work out as planned?

1169
01:34:04,579 --> 01:34:05,955
Thanks to you, it did.

1170
01:34:08,842 --> 01:34:12,804
Conflict breaks out easily
in small communities.

1171
01:34:13,054 --> 01:34:16,850
Even though they've lived shoulder
to shoulder for many years,

1172
01:34:16,891 --> 01:34:19,436
even the smallest incident
festers hatred

1173
01:34:19,627 --> 01:34:23,178
and in the end, they end up
killing each other off.

1174
01:34:24,341 --> 01:34:27,052
That sounds like the Uchiha Clan.

1175
01:34:27,569 --> 01:34:30,447
They were definitely like that, however...

1176
01:34:32,189 --> 01:34:34,733
This is the truth of
the Chinoike Clan.

1177
01:34:36,343 --> 01:34:38,713
When my wife got wrapped up
in everything and died...

1178
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:42,097
lots of things didn't matter anymore.

1179
01:34:42,459 --> 01:34:45,503
That's why you killed
your entire clan?

1180
01:34:47,005 --> 01:34:50,258
Even still, my daughter
is quite endearing.

1181
01:34:50,675 --> 01:34:53,470
And you saw with your own eyes
the foolish thing

1182
01:34:53,495 --> 01:34:56,415
that your dear daughter of yours
was doing in the Coliseum.

1183
01:34:56,698 --> 01:34:59,784
I wonder if that's why
you gave up on acquiring Sasuke,

1184
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:03,347
and used him instead
to stop your daughter?

1185
01:35:04,581 --> 01:35:05,906
You're such a doting parent...

1186
01:35:06,198 --> 01:35:09,569
I consider myself more
of a foolish parent...

1187
01:35:10,945 --> 01:35:13,907
Still it feels strange.

1188
01:35:14,649 --> 01:35:18,661
Sasuke's not back in the village,
yet he's protecting it.

1189
01:35:20,196 --> 01:35:21,405
You're right.

1190
01:35:21,523 --> 01:35:24,317
There are so many things
we can't do

1191
01:35:24,601 --> 01:35:26,484
without a skilled shinobi like Sasuke.

1192
01:35:26,928 --> 01:35:31,132
There are guys who do
terrible things like this time,

1193
01:35:31,650 --> 01:35:33,943
but I guess everything works out

1194
01:35:34,010 --> 01:35:36,345
as long as there are guys
like Sasuke to counter it.

1195
01:35:38,139 --> 01:35:40,934
You seem kinda happy, Sakura.

1196
01:35:41,142 --> 01:35:41,835
Huh?

1197
01:35:45,271 --> 01:35:48,441
Sasuke said to me before
he left on his journey...

1198
01:35:49,559 --> 01:35:51,686
<i>This is a trip to atone for my sins.</i>

1199
01:35:52,612 --> 01:35:54,289
With this recent incident,

1200
01:35:54,314 --> 01:35:58,777
I know that Sasuke is
definitely making inroads.

1201
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:01,512
Just...

1202
01:36:02,823 --> 01:36:06,459
I just wish I was there next to him...

1203
01:36:08,086 --> 01:36:10,922
F-Forget what I just said!

1204
01:36:11,038 --> 01:36:11,597
Huh?

1205
01:36:31,992 --> 01:36:33,220
It's probably from Kakashi.

1206
01:36:44,163 --> 01:36:46,874
It's so messy. It's Naruto's handwriting...

1207
01:36:48,869 --> 01:36:49,978
<i>Sasuke...</i>

1208
01:36:50,003 --> 01:36:54,315
<i>You're not back in the village,
but you're still protecting it.</i>

1209
01:36:54,832 --> 01:36:57,051
<i>You're just like the Leaf Police Force!</i>

1210
01:36:59,129 --> 01:37:01,305
<i>Are you going to join too?</i>

1211
01:37:01,598 --> 01:37:03,474
<i>Well... I wonder about that...</i>

1212
01:37:03,474 --> 01:37:04,601
<i>Why not?</i>

1213
01:37:05,226 --> 01:37:08,896
<i>When I grow up, I'm going to join
the Leaf Police Force too!</i>

1214
01:37:15,311 --> 01:37:17,820
It's been a while...
Maybe I'll go home.
