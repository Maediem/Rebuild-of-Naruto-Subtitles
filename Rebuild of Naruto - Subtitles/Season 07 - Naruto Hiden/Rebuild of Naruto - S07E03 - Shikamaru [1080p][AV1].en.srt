1
00:01:42,116 --> 00:01:45,661
So, I told my classmates...

2
00:01:46,467 --> 00:01:48,886
that they were lucky to have
so much free time.

3
00:01:49,456 --> 00:01:51,875
It's been a month since I got here.

4
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,339
Isn't it about time I get to supervise
a big assignment on my own?

5
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,136
Oh, Lord Hokage!

6
00:02:02,636 --> 00:02:04,847
Where was yesterday's report again?

7
00:02:05,264 --> 00:02:07,975
Third pile to the right,
the second one.

8
00:02:10,436 --> 00:02:11,770
Oh, here it is.

9
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:14,085
Didn't this come with
some attachments?

10
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,987
Second pile, the third one.

11
00:02:16,817 --> 00:02:18,986
I don't know what
I'd do without you.

12
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:21,649
Oh right, Lord Hokage.

13
00:02:22,072 --> 00:02:23,657
About next week's inspection...

14
00:02:23,734 --> 00:02:26,529
I keep telling you to
just call me Kakashi.

15
00:02:26,744 --> 00:02:29,747
You're way too stiff
and formal, Senpai!

16
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,625
And don't forget to take a break.

17
00:02:33,876 --> 00:02:35,753
Efficiency gets compromised
if you don't.

18
00:02:36,086 --> 00:02:37,129
Roger!

19
00:02:42,986 --> 00:02:44,070
Anyway...

20
00:02:44,386 --> 00:02:48,682
I didn't become a shinobi
to be chained to a desk.

21
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:54,146
Senpai, how do you not get bored
doing this sort of work?

22
00:02:54,855 --> 00:02:55,856
Senpai?

23
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:59,542
I haven't looked up at the clouds
in a long time.

24
00:02:59,567 --> 00:03:03,473
You know... sometimes you talk like an old man.

25
00:03:08,631 --> 00:03:11,667
Senpai, is something bothering you?

26
00:03:12,456 --> 00:03:13,415
Huh?

27
00:03:14,432 --> 00:03:15,642
No.

28
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,265
And, I'm done for the day!

29
00:03:23,013 --> 00:03:24,014
Man!

30
00:03:24,177 --> 00:03:26,053
We cruised through today!

31
00:03:26,345 --> 00:03:28,472
Thanks, and see ya tomorrow!

32
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:32,159
Oh, Lord Hokage!

33
00:03:32,184 --> 00:03:33,685
Thanks, and see ya tomorrow!

34
00:03:34,126 --> 00:03:35,052
See ya...

35
00:03:37,356 --> 00:03:38,357
Thanks for today.

36
00:03:38,932 --> 00:03:41,010
Why'd you pick a guy like that?

37
00:03:41,527 --> 00:03:43,946
The adult world is complicated.

38
00:03:44,696 --> 00:03:47,116
I don't like that kind of stuff.

39
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:48,742
Oh?

40
00:03:48,767 --> 00:03:52,270
I thought you became
one of us a while back.

41
00:03:52,663 --> 00:03:54,164
Give me a break!

42
00:03:55,112 --> 00:04:00,212
Having more shinobi like him
just goes to show we're at peace.

43
00:04:01,255 --> 00:04:03,006
It's been two years since then.

44
00:04:03,674 --> 00:04:06,677
I'm starting to get a belly...

45
00:04:07,594 --> 00:04:09,096
I don't want to hear it.

46
00:04:09,763 --> 00:04:12,015
Do you keep up with training?

47
00:04:12,232 --> 00:04:13,813
Here and there.

48
00:04:14,437 --> 00:04:17,822
You say it like that, but I bet
you're as diligent as ever.

49
00:04:17,952 --> 00:04:19,912
Why can't you just
humor me a bit?

50
00:04:19,973 --> 00:04:22,642
I told him to double-check it!

51
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,719
By the way, how is it going?
Regarding that issue.

52
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,076
It's on the back-burner.

53
00:04:31,577 --> 00:04:33,036
No contact then?

54
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:37,916
I feel bad burdening you
with it.

55
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:42,004
I was never really
cut out to be a shinobi.

56
00:04:42,087 --> 00:04:44,006
The fact that
I continue to be one...

57
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:47,426
Is to make Naruto
the Hokage one day, right?

58
00:04:47,926 --> 00:04:51,722
To make sure that happens,
I can't be a child forever.

59
00:04:51,995 --> 00:04:54,665
Naruto's still a child, even now.

60
00:04:54,716 --> 00:04:56,201
He is who he is.

61
00:04:56,226 --> 00:04:57,686
Oh...

62
00:04:57,711 --> 00:05:00,256
How about we go grab
a bite after you're done?

63
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:04,774
After this, Lord Tsuchikage
and I have a game.

64
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:07,879
Oh right, I saw him
at the conference yesterday.

65
00:05:08,217 --> 00:05:11,429
All he talked about was how
he would beat you this time.

66
00:05:11,617 --> 00:05:13,827
Anyway, please go easy on him.

67
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:16,303
Well, half of it is work for me.

68
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,125
Hey, Shikamaru...

69
00:05:20,584 --> 00:05:23,420
I wonder what it means
to become an adult?

70
00:05:31,897 --> 00:05:34,113
No, wait... This one?

71
00:05:37,017 --> 00:05:40,103
How's that, young 'un?
You're speechless now, eh?

72
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,209
Please excuse me...

73
00:05:45,234 --> 00:05:48,904
Hey, don't think
I'll let you win and run!

74
00:05:56,745 --> 00:05:57,496
Tsk...

75
00:05:57,811 --> 00:06:00,063
I have to work twice
as hard tomorrow.

76
00:06:15,931 --> 00:06:17,015
Welcome!

77
00:06:17,432 --> 00:06:18,976
Oh, there he is!

78
00:06:19,476 --> 00:06:20,644
Over here!

79
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:23,098
Sorry I'm late.

80
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:26,817
That's the meat I was grilling!

81
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:28,026
Here you go.

82
00:06:28,051 --> 00:06:29,414
This one's done too.

83
00:06:30,112 --> 00:06:31,530
Another order of kalbi please!

84
00:06:31,982 --> 00:06:36,674
Anyway, I keep teaching this newbie
and she just doesn't get it.

85
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:39,045
There's one on my team too.

86
00:06:39,204 --> 00:06:42,291
He reminds me of myself
and I just can't ignore him.

87
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,462
I wonder if Asuma felt this way.

88
00:06:46,003 --> 00:06:48,755
You two have totally embraced
your roles as instructors.

89
00:06:49,631 --> 00:06:52,676
Well, you're Lord Hokage's
right-hand man, aren't you?

90
00:06:53,135 --> 00:06:58,307
But I don't have anyone
under me to mentor.

91
00:06:58,557 --> 00:07:02,352
You're the type that prefers
to just do things yourself.

92
00:07:02,503 --> 00:07:04,421
Being a loner suits me.

93
00:07:04,813 --> 00:07:07,733
You two are the only ones
who are special to me.

94
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,861
I miss the old days.

95
00:07:11,493 --> 00:07:13,537
Hey, we're not old enough
to be saying that.

96
00:07:13,905 --> 00:07:18,577
Back then, it was normal for us
to be together 24/7.

97
00:07:18,994 --> 00:07:23,915
Now, we have to set up
a time and date just to eat together.

98
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,752
It's kinda sad, huh?

99
00:07:26,806 --> 00:07:31,144
Maybe that's what it means
to become an adult.

100
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:35,177
That's for sure.
Your temperament's changed.

101
00:07:35,177 --> 00:07:37,346
Huh? You've got to be kidding.

102
00:07:37,596 --> 00:07:40,641
Lately, you never say,
"what a drag."

103
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:41,875
Haven't you noticed?

104
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:43,935
Really?

105
00:07:44,515 --> 00:07:47,265
– Thanks for the food!
– Thank you!

106
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:50,369
They gave me gum when
I was at the register.

107
00:07:51,017 --> 00:07:51,976
Doesn't this bring
back memories?

108
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,382
Doesn't this bring
back memories?

109
00:07:53,612 --> 00:07:56,406
I always chewed this
when I was a kid!

110
00:07:57,532 --> 00:08:00,035
Oh, it's so sweet!
Was it always this sweet?

111
00:08:00,077 --> 00:08:02,037
Okay, where to next?

112
00:08:03,246 --> 00:08:05,123
You still want to eat more?

113
00:08:05,207 --> 00:08:07,751
Let's go BBQ hopping!

114
00:08:07,776 --> 00:08:09,903
Sorry, I have to go.

115
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,021
Huh?!

116
00:08:11,771 --> 00:08:15,509
Shikamaru...
Is something on your mind?

117
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,956
Your mind seems to be wandering.

118
00:08:19,258 --> 00:08:20,684
It's nothing.

119
00:08:21,109 --> 00:08:24,476
I have to leave the village for work,
on Shinobi Alliance business.

120
00:08:24,976 --> 00:08:28,282
Is it the same thing Temari
and Kankuro attend?

121
00:08:29,903 --> 00:08:32,893
So Temari is more important
than us?

122
00:08:33,735 --> 00:08:34,861
Oww...

123
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:37,108
What are you talking about?

124
00:08:38,878 --> 00:08:42,006
And so, we hope that
it grows even more.

125
00:08:42,327 --> 00:08:44,913
That concludes my activity report.

126
00:08:45,103 --> 00:08:47,188
Are there any other questions?

127
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:50,997
Regarding the long list of
missing persons after the Great War...

128
00:08:51,336 --> 00:08:53,088
How is the search going?

129
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,379
It's currently under investigation.

130
00:08:55,625 --> 00:09:00,004
How about the drop in shinobi requests
for three consecutive periods?

131
00:09:00,637 --> 00:09:02,055
It's currently under investigation.

132
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:06,045
You know, if it keeps dropping,

133
00:09:06,101 --> 00:09:07,811
it'll affect how we administer
the villages.

134
00:09:07,836 --> 00:09:13,091
We should have a more
detailed report by the next meeting.

135
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:16,525
I understand the view

136
00:09:16,837 --> 00:09:19,580
that a decrease in requests
for shinobi poses a concern.

137
00:09:20,449 --> 00:09:23,952
But remember,
this is a consequence of peace.

138
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,290
If there are no more questions,

139
00:09:27,361 --> 00:09:30,030
we'll meet again in one month.

140
00:09:32,373 --> 00:09:34,876
Hey! Wait, Shikamaru!

141
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,252
What's going on, Temari?

142
00:09:40,091 --> 00:09:42,637
You're hiding something, aren't you?

143
00:09:43,071 --> 00:09:45,282
Huh? What makes you say that?

144
00:09:45,324 --> 00:09:46,533
See?

145
00:09:46,558 --> 00:09:50,353
When you answer a question with a
question, it's proof that something's up.

146
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:52,960
What's going on in
the Hidden Leaf Village.

147
00:09:53,249 --> 00:09:54,750
I don't know what
you're talking about.

148
00:09:54,831 --> 00:09:56,958
It's something you can't talk
to me about?

149
00:09:57,349 --> 00:09:59,059
I said there's nothing going on!

150
00:09:59,659 --> 00:10:03,496
So there's nothing I can help with?

151
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,991
Nope.

152
00:10:05,643 --> 00:10:06,644
I see...

153
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,266
Hey, Temari...

154
00:10:08,955 --> 00:10:12,667
Both you and I are representatives
of our villages...

155
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,719
We shouldn't pry too much
into the other's—

156
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,369
What the hell—?!

157
00:10:20,394 --> 00:10:22,115
I misjudged you!

158
00:10:28,155 --> 00:10:31,117
So that's what made
you remember your old man.

159
00:10:31,142 --> 00:10:31,953
Yes.

160
00:10:31,978 --> 00:10:35,607
He often got yelled at by
my mom for staying out all night.

161
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:37,526
Sorry you had to go through that.

162
00:10:37,734 --> 00:10:39,778
Temari is very intuitive.

163
00:10:40,124 --> 00:10:41,708
She's going to find out
sooner or later

164
00:10:41,802 --> 00:10:43,428
about the Land of Silence.

165
00:10:43,848 --> 00:10:45,975
Many of the missing from
the Great War

166
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,379
and rogue ninja are filtering
into this mysterious land.

167
00:10:49,955 --> 00:10:51,623
And there's a deep, dark rumor

168
00:10:51,648 --> 00:10:54,359
that it's undertaking
shinobi missions illegally.

169
00:10:54,668 --> 00:10:58,797
By rights, the Shinobi Alliance
should deal with this problem.

170
00:10:58,964 --> 00:11:01,049
It'll be troublesome if
they find out that

171
00:11:01,174 --> 00:11:04,177
we're independently
investigating this.

172
00:11:04,219 --> 00:11:06,888
But taking action on
the Land of Silence

173
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:10,100
in the name of the alliance
will be touchy.

174
00:11:10,673 --> 00:11:13,426
Just when we finally
achieved peace.

175
00:11:13,979 --> 00:11:16,273
It's already been two weeks
since Sai left word

176
00:11:16,298 --> 00:11:19,009
that he was infiltrating
the Land of Silence, right?

177
00:11:19,761 --> 00:11:22,222
We can't just stand by without
taking action any further.

178
00:11:28,675 --> 00:11:29,927
It's finally here.

179
00:11:36,293 --> 00:11:38,795
<i>The state of affairs is more serious
than we previously thought.</i>

180
00:11:39,111 --> 00:11:41,321
<i>If the Land of Silence is left
to continue as is,</i>

181
00:11:41,405 --> 00:11:43,741
<i>the Shinobi Alliance will
be threatened at some point.</i>

182
00:11:44,233 --> 00:11:47,820
<i>There is one leader
at work in this land.</i>

183
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,890
<i>His name is...</i>

184
00:11:49,973 --> 00:11:50,974
Gengo.

185
00:11:51,534 --> 00:11:53,244
I've never heard that name before.

186
00:11:53,951 --> 00:11:56,620
<i>It's possible,
he will become the one</i>

187
00:11:57,145 --> 00:11:59,583
<i>who may very well change
the pitiful existence of shinobi...</i>

188
00:11:59,608 --> 00:12:02,777
<i>In fact, he may change
the whole framework of this world.</i>

189
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:06,370
<i>I don't even know
myself anymore...</i>

190
00:12:06,781 --> 00:12:08,033
This isn't good.

191
00:12:08,592 --> 00:12:09,718
Right?

192
00:12:09,743 --> 00:12:11,578
Sai led a team of ten,

193
00:12:11,661 --> 00:12:15,123
comprised of the cream of
the crop among the ANBU.

194
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:19,002
It would take a formidable enemy
to wipe them out...

195
00:12:19,243 --> 00:12:20,244
Probably...

196
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:22,464
Sai's instincts were right.

197
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,085
Many of the shinobi who
disappeared after the Great War

198
00:12:26,263 --> 00:12:28,974
and rogue shinobi are
in the Land of Silence.

199
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:31,097
I hope Sai is all right.

200
00:12:31,637 --> 00:12:35,016
He's not one to get killed
so easily, but...

201
00:12:35,327 --> 00:12:38,038
There are hints in
his message that sound

202
00:12:38,063 --> 00:12:41,024
like admiration for
this man named Gengo.

203
00:12:41,445 --> 00:12:43,364
You don't think Sai has...?

204
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,930
He's very pure hearted, so...

205
00:12:46,054 --> 00:12:47,556
If we're to get Sai out of there

206
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:50,193
and nip the Land of Silence
in the bud...

207
00:12:50,425 --> 00:12:53,261
we have just one option.

208
00:12:53,538 --> 00:12:56,666
Could we be thinking
the same thing?

209
00:12:56,998 --> 00:12:57,718
Yes.

210
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,170
However, you can't go.

211
00:13:01,561 --> 00:13:02,385
Right...

212
00:13:02,762 --> 00:13:06,432
To go unnoticed,
a three-man squad will be best.

213
00:13:06,883 --> 00:13:09,678
Could you get two good shinobi
from the ANBU?

214
00:13:10,228 --> 00:13:11,771
A three-man squad...

215
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,952
You already have someone in mind
for the third member?

216
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,977
What we're attempting is

217
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,979
a clear breach of faith
toward the alliance.

218
00:13:19,453 --> 00:13:20,455
If worse comes to worst,

219
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,899
we would have to disavow
any knowledge of this team.

220
00:13:24,467 --> 00:13:25,468
I'll go.

221
00:13:26,027 --> 00:13:29,864
You carry a big part of
the responsibilities within the alliance.

222
00:13:29,998 --> 00:13:31,083
You can't...

223
00:13:31,108 --> 00:13:33,069
I'm simply adding another job
to my plate.

224
00:13:33,407 --> 00:13:35,326
It's useless to try to
stop you, isn't it?

225
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,882
Still, I would have thought
you'd pick Ino and Choji.

226
00:13:41,084 --> 00:13:43,378
For this mission,

227
00:13:43,645 --> 00:13:48,316
we need someone who can
control chakra and can hide us.

228
00:13:48,674 --> 00:13:52,028
And someone who has a jutsu
to make a direct hit on the target.

229
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,101
Besides...

230
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,311
Besides?

231
00:13:54,628 --> 00:13:57,673
Those two have
their own lives now.

232
00:13:58,893 --> 00:14:01,312
I think I know just
the ANBU for this.

233
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:05,263
They're both easy to work with...

234
00:14:05,984 --> 00:14:07,902
So I'm sure you'll like them.

235
00:14:09,754 --> 00:14:10,755
What?

236
00:14:11,091 --> 00:14:12,651
Going on a business trip, Senpai?

237
00:14:13,076 --> 00:14:15,213
Yeah. Hold down the fort for me.

238
00:14:15,846 --> 00:14:17,181
It must be nice!

239
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,341
I wish I could go too!

240
00:14:19,543 --> 00:14:20,767
Damn it.

241
00:14:21,345 --> 00:14:23,555
Please bring me back a souvenir!

242
00:14:23,658 --> 00:14:26,078
Yeah sure, I will.

243
00:14:26,598 --> 00:14:28,183
This is Soku of the ANBU.

244
00:14:29,347 --> 00:14:31,224
Easy to work with, huh?

245
00:14:32,469 --> 00:14:34,387
And where's the other one?

246
00:14:34,835 --> 00:14:36,211
I am right here.

247
00:14:36,884 --> 00:14:37,885
When did you—?

248
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:39,374
He's Ro.

249
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:42,954
He has the ability to freely manipulate
his own and others' chakra

250
00:14:42,979 --> 00:14:46,983
to erase all signs of his presence
or become another person.

251
00:14:47,627 --> 00:14:49,919
If I were to put it simply,

252
00:14:50,061 --> 00:14:51,988
it's a modification of
the chakra from

253
00:14:52,013 --> 00:14:53,974
the point of view of
what others perceive.

254
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:58,636
I do not actually increase
the chakra of the target,

255
00:14:58,861 --> 00:15:02,240
I create a discrepancy
in their perception.

256
00:15:02,392 --> 00:15:04,184
Like, that's even more confusing.

257
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:06,461
This one's still a kid.

258
00:15:06,665 --> 00:15:07,916
Like, unthinkable, right?

259
00:15:08,051 --> 00:15:10,648
In the world of shinobi,
ability is, like, everything.

260
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,140
You don't mince words.

261
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,474
After the Academy, we noticed Hinoko's
talents and scouted her for the ANBU.

262
00:15:18,136 --> 00:15:21,456
She's only 14, but she's already
highly regarded in the ANBU.

263
00:15:21,557 --> 00:15:24,727
I asked you to like,
not to use my real name, Lord Hokage.

264
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,431
Your name's Hinoko?

265
00:15:27,721 --> 00:15:29,556
That's a really cute na—!

266
00:15:30,468 --> 00:15:33,179
I, like, hate to be called that name.

267
00:15:33,282 --> 00:15:35,785
I'd like you to be careful
about that.

268
00:15:35,957 --> 00:15:38,125
So, what can you do?

269
00:15:38,311 --> 00:15:40,313
My weapon is a chakra needle.

270
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:47,070
Once my needle hones in
on a target,

271
00:15:47,095 --> 00:15:49,848
it will not stop its pursuit until
it pierces its target.

272
00:15:50,276 --> 00:15:52,570
Very suitable for assassination.

273
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,398
I don't like, needlessly kill.

274
00:16:00,945 --> 00:16:03,822
I pierced its chakra stimulation point,

275
00:16:03,847 --> 00:16:05,849
so it's like, several times
more active now.

276
00:16:07,911 --> 00:16:09,996
We'll infiltrate using Ro's jutsu,

277
00:16:10,021 --> 00:16:12,982
then I'll immobilize the target
with my Shadow Strangle Jutsu,

278
00:16:13,337 --> 00:16:14,755
and Soku will finish him.

279
00:16:15,046 --> 00:16:20,969
A true collaboration indeed.
The synergy in this plan is ideal.

280
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:22,735
Like, that sounds tedious.

281
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,803
They're exactly what you wanted.

282
00:16:25,065 --> 00:16:27,025
I have no objections...

283
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:29,043
Then, like, what's the issue?

284
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,300
Can you drop the "like" thing?

285
00:16:32,548 --> 00:16:33,508
Like, absolutely not.

286
00:16:33,568 --> 00:16:36,279
Well, it's decided.
So once everything's ready—

287
00:16:36,304 --> 00:16:38,848
Would it be okay to leave
tomorrow morning?

288
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:42,064
It's not shogi again, is it?

289
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,597
I have some business
to take care of.

290
00:16:46,377 --> 00:16:47,671
So anyway, looks like

291
00:16:47,696 --> 00:16:52,738
I'll be heading back a bit later,
so I won't be able to visit next month.

292
00:16:53,217 --> 00:16:56,376
I have two subordinates under me.

293
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,371
It's not like me, huh?

294
00:17:07,135 --> 00:17:12,682
Both you and my dad had someone
you'd give your lives to protect.

295
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,409
But, I haven't found anyone
like that yet...

296
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,120
Big Brother Shika!

297
00:17:20,253 --> 00:17:21,338
Mirai!

298
00:17:21,715 --> 00:17:22,716
Big Brother Shika!

299
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:23,951
Whoa, there!

300
00:17:27,372 --> 00:17:29,833
Shikamaru, you're so busy these days,

301
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,053
you don't need to
come every month.

302
00:17:32,923 --> 00:17:34,508
I'm not that busy.

303
00:17:35,479 --> 00:17:37,127
This is our babysitter.

304
00:17:37,545 --> 00:17:39,964
She occasionally watches
Mirai for me.

305
00:17:39,989 --> 00:17:40,990
Hello.

306
00:17:41,783 --> 00:17:44,577
He may not look it, but he's
Lord Hokage's right-hand man.

307
00:17:44,602 --> 00:17:45,853
Please...

308
00:17:45,954 --> 00:17:47,580
Oh, I see!

309
00:17:47,914 --> 00:17:50,750
I'm sorry, I still don't know
these things yet.

310
00:17:51,225 --> 00:17:54,228
She just started living here.

311
00:17:54,527 --> 00:17:57,238
People are moving into
this village

312
00:17:57,378 --> 00:17:59,547
all because of people like
you and the Lord Hokage.

313
00:18:00,022 --> 00:18:01,190
Please, don't mention it.

314
00:18:01,523 --> 00:18:04,639
I hope this peace will last
for a long time.

315
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,164
Big Brother!

316
00:18:08,685 --> 00:18:09,564
Flowers!

317
00:18:09,828 --> 00:18:12,873
Oh really?
You brought them for your daddy?

318
00:18:13,314 --> 00:18:14,825
You're so clever, Mirai!

319
00:18:15,332 --> 00:18:18,568
Mirai, you really love
Big Brother Shikamaru, don't you?

320
00:18:19,191 --> 00:18:19,939
Uh-huh!

321
00:18:23,574 --> 00:18:26,202
This peace will last.

322
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:29,115
I'll make it last.

323
00:18:37,628 --> 00:18:39,421
Why now?

324
00:18:40,167 --> 00:18:41,210
Damn it!

325
00:18:41,776 --> 00:18:43,027
Such bad luck.

326
00:18:54,898 --> 00:18:56,774
Hey, Shikamaru!

327
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,500
You're up awfully early.

328
00:19:00,934 --> 00:19:01,935
Naruto...

329
00:19:02,703 --> 00:19:04,705
I could say the same about you.

330
00:19:04,899 --> 00:19:07,610
I got up and couldn't
go back to sleep...

331
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:10,025
I'm on my way home
from Ichiraku Ramen.

332
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,966
That shop opens that early?

333
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,794
It's open 24 hours now!

334
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,753
Yeah but, who eats ramen
for breakfast?

335
00:19:18,877 --> 00:19:21,088
I could eat it for breakfast,
lunch, and dinner.

336
00:19:21,113 --> 00:19:24,032
Half of my body's made of ramen!

337
00:19:26,471 --> 00:19:28,973
Hmm?
Do I smell like garlic?

338
00:19:29,349 --> 00:19:30,350
Oh...

339
00:19:31,732 --> 00:19:32,942
Chew this.

340
00:19:34,888 --> 00:19:36,390
This brings back memories!

341
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,298
I love this stuff!

342
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:42,478
See ya.

343
00:19:43,026 --> 00:19:43,902
Work?

344
00:19:43,967 --> 00:19:45,718
Yeah, just a little.

345
00:19:46,494 --> 00:19:48,830
Don't just sit around
and eat ramen.

346
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:49,916
Do some work.

347
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,567
Well, a certain someone somewhere

348
00:19:51,718 --> 00:19:53,929
keeps assigning me
annoying missions...

349
00:19:54,209 --> 00:19:56,170
So I won't have a break
for the next six months.

350
00:19:56,709 --> 00:19:59,754
This is the most critical time
in your life.

351
00:20:00,204 --> 00:20:01,923
I know that.

352
00:20:01,923 --> 00:20:02,673
But you know—

353
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:04,085
No buts!

354
00:20:04,606 --> 00:20:06,900
Take on as many missions
as possible,

355
00:20:07,111 --> 00:20:09,071
make it so everyone says,

356
00:20:09,222 --> 00:20:11,057
"It has to be Naruto,
no one else will do."

357
00:20:11,308 --> 00:20:13,101
If you think
they acknowledge you now

358
00:20:13,126 --> 00:20:15,879
because you're the hero
of the Great War, you're wrong.

359
00:20:16,343 --> 00:20:17,417
Yeah, yeah.

360
00:20:18,147 --> 00:20:20,047
– Hey, Naruto.
– Hmm?

361
00:20:20,691 --> 00:20:22,902
You're going to become
the Hokage.

362
00:20:23,528 --> 00:20:25,113
Don't ever forget that.

363
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,377
I never go back on my word.

364
00:20:28,591 --> 00:20:30,343
That's my ninja way.

365
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,620
You mean "our" way.

366
00:20:32,987 --> 00:20:33,988
Yeah.

367
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,042
<i>Naruto...</i>

368
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:41,254
<i>Always stay
just the way you are.</i>

369
00:20:42,463 --> 00:20:45,842
<i>That's the reason why I'm here.</i>

370
00:20:50,448 --> 00:20:52,065
Anyway...

371
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:54,009
I guess it's time to go to work.

372
00:21:02,247 --> 00:21:06,126
That's the inn that Lord Sai
last stopped by...

373
00:21:06,668 --> 00:21:07,418
Yeah.

374
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:09,587
Also, look slightly above it.

375
00:21:12,265 --> 00:21:14,767
That's the only checkpoint leading
into the village of Tobari.

376
00:21:15,526 --> 00:21:19,029
Unless we get past it,
we can't get to the village.

377
00:21:22,845 --> 00:21:26,856
Sure, but is this get-up, like,
really necessary?

378
00:21:27,272 --> 00:21:29,399
It looks very becoming
on you, Soku.

379
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:36,406
Look, I had to bend over backwards to
get a coal vendor's traveling permit.

380
00:21:36,938 --> 00:21:41,234
If you have any better ideas on getting
past the checkpoint, let me know.

381
00:21:42,345 --> 00:21:46,708
We can humbly assure you that we will be
able to deceive the enemy's eyes with this.

382
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,543
Like, if we kill all the lookouts,

383
00:21:48,685 --> 00:21:51,104
it will be easy to pass
through the checkpoint!

384
00:21:51,412 --> 00:21:55,884
It would spell trouble if we do that
and they found out the Leaf's involved.

385
00:21:56,693 --> 00:22:00,363
Besides, Sai's entire team
was killed around here.

386
00:22:00,614 --> 00:22:01,990
Don't underestimate the enemy.

387
00:22:02,015 --> 00:22:03,266
If we linger too long,

388
00:22:03,349 --> 00:22:06,269
we'll only, like, increase the chances
of the enemy noticing us.

389
00:22:07,481 --> 00:22:09,882
Both of you, listen up.

390
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:20,723
Look, I think it's crucial that
we trust each other.

391
00:22:21,297 --> 00:22:26,802
And trust first begins with
having faith in your partner.

392
00:22:27,373 --> 00:22:29,709
Did you get that out of, like,
some weird book?

393
00:22:30,084 --> 00:22:35,298
Lord Shikamaru is doing
his utmost to act like our leader.

394
00:22:35,626 --> 00:22:38,587
Quit trying to analyze me!

395
00:22:39,011 --> 00:22:41,738
Anyway! This mission
requires teamwork—

396
00:22:42,055 --> 00:22:42,768
Huh?!

397
00:22:43,473 --> 00:22:44,891
What's the big idea?!

398
00:22:45,246 --> 00:22:46,456
Like, take a good look.

399
00:22:49,776 --> 00:22:51,231
Land of Silence shinobi?!

400
00:22:53,107 --> 00:22:53,908
Soku!

401
00:22:56,361 --> 00:22:57,862
Don't take action by yourself!

402
00:22:57,946 --> 00:23:00,112
I'm better at, like,
this sort of thing!

403
00:23:13,864 --> 00:23:14,837
I did it!

404
00:23:16,222 --> 00:23:18,265
Hey, c'mon.

405
00:23:19,506 --> 00:23:21,758
You just ruined our disguise.

406
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,778
This has turned out to be
a troublesome situation.

407
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:29,022
Well... I guess it's back to
square one for our strategy.

408
00:23:53,689 --> 00:23:55,274
What'll you have?

409
00:23:55,299 --> 00:23:56,967
Can I have water?

410
00:23:59,048 --> 00:24:00,675
You can have all you want.

411
00:24:03,729 --> 00:24:05,105
Anyway...

412
00:24:05,976 --> 00:24:10,397
I heard the checkpoint
to Tobari is around here.

413
00:24:10,476 --> 00:24:13,146
I've got nothing to say to outsiders.

414
00:24:18,502 --> 00:24:20,212
The "demon killer"?

415
00:24:21,776 --> 00:24:24,779
Oh... You know the game?

416
00:24:25,283 --> 00:24:27,243
May I sit in?

417
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:31,086
What luck finding an opponent
in these parts.

418
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:34,330
A welcome sight indeed.

419
00:24:34,818 --> 00:24:36,717
Are you traveling alone?

420
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:41,026
I've come to the village of Tobari
to request shinobi assistance.

421
00:24:41,466 --> 00:24:44,260
But they're checking
my background and what not,

422
00:24:44,963 --> 00:24:46,450
so, I've had to wait,
as you can see.

423
00:24:46,475 --> 00:24:48,101
The Village of Tobari?

424
00:24:48,348 --> 00:24:51,434
I've been wanting to do
some business there.

425
00:24:52,061 --> 00:24:54,772
Going in and out of there
is such hassle.

426
00:24:55,898 --> 00:24:59,392
Unless you have this pass,
it's probably impossible.

427
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,414
You got me!

428
00:25:02,612 --> 00:25:04,238
Didn't expect that move!

429
00:25:04,523 --> 00:25:05,906
Time's up...

430
00:25:07,733 --> 00:25:09,068
By the way...

431
00:25:09,365 --> 00:25:11,618
Why did you choose
the Land of Silence?

432
00:25:11,913 --> 00:25:15,458
There are other lands that
accept shinobi requests.

433
00:25:16,001 --> 00:25:17,945
Well, it's the price.

434
00:25:18,431 --> 00:25:20,301
After all, I don't mind
who does the work itself,

435
00:25:20,326 --> 00:25:24,705
whether it's the Silence
or the Hidden Leaf.

436
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:28,988
After all, shinobi are merely
appendages that you use,

437
00:25:29,013 --> 00:25:31,015
then discard.

438
00:25:33,346 --> 00:25:34,674
Please excuse me!

439
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:40,166
Are you trying to sabotage
our strategy?

440
00:25:40,384 --> 00:25:42,607
It's because we let guys like that
say whatever they want that,

441
00:25:42,632 --> 00:25:45,343
like, shinobi are always
looked down upon.

442
00:25:45,463 --> 00:25:47,924
That's no reason to kill him.

443
00:25:48,116 --> 00:25:50,868
I just wanted to
shake him up a little.

444
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:54,028
Like, you're the one
who doesn't trust us.

445
00:25:54,361 --> 00:25:57,105
Then act with more caution.

446
00:25:59,495 --> 00:26:00,795
Got any complaints?

447
00:26:01,838 --> 00:26:06,676
No way I'll mess up a mission
by being, like, overcautious!

448
00:26:08,835 --> 00:26:09,752
That girl...

449
00:26:10,911 --> 00:26:12,923
Isn't she acting too rash?

450
00:26:13,356 --> 00:26:16,609
More than anyone,
Soku fears that peace in the land

451
00:26:16,694 --> 00:26:22,491
will spell the end of
the existence of shinobi.

452
00:26:24,595 --> 00:26:26,988
I presume she is determined
to make this mission a success

453
00:26:27,013 --> 00:26:30,100
to prove the value of shinobi
to the world.

454
00:26:30,746 --> 00:26:34,490
So much blood was shed
to achieve this long-sought peace.

455
00:26:35,163 --> 00:26:37,999
It's ridiculous that
some people can't stomach it.

456
00:26:38,503 --> 00:26:42,046
Lord Shikamaru, you proved
your mettle and worth as a shinobi

457
00:26:42,071 --> 00:26:44,573
in the last Great Ninja War.

458
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:46,632
But she's never had
a chance to do so.

459
00:26:47,258 --> 00:26:50,136
Such is the sorrow of
the generation that came too late.

460
00:26:51,898 --> 00:26:54,276
Ro, what about you?

461
00:26:54,935 --> 00:26:57,518
You've experienced a lot,
haven't you?

462
00:26:58,186 --> 00:27:01,688
I simply escaped death,
that is all.

463
00:27:01,713 --> 00:27:03,799
Everyone, do not move!

464
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:08,196
We're going to confirm
your identity.

465
00:27:08,612 --> 00:27:10,739
You will not be allowed
to leave the building!

466
00:27:10,764 --> 00:27:11,477
Hey!

467
00:27:14,327 --> 00:27:15,328
What happened?

468
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,414
The shinobi in the ravine were,
like, discovered.

469
00:27:19,855 --> 00:27:21,918
They move faster than I thought.

470
00:27:24,562 --> 00:27:25,563
Don't!

471
00:27:25,588 --> 00:27:27,673
– We can't make a scene now.
– <i>I'm just waiting for my shogi partner!</i>

472
00:27:27,673 --> 00:27:29,133
– Then what do we do?!
– <i>Move!</i>

473
00:27:29,133 --> 00:27:31,093
– I'm thinking...
– <i>You two!</i>

474
00:27:32,445 --> 00:27:33,613
Over here!

475
00:27:37,058 --> 00:27:38,142
How dare you!

476
00:27:38,142 --> 00:27:39,977
What are you doing?

477
00:27:41,145 --> 00:27:43,247
We owe our lives to you.

478
00:27:43,272 --> 00:27:44,899
No thanks necessary.

479
00:27:45,107 --> 00:27:48,069
I hate those guys from Tobari.

480
00:27:48,528 --> 00:27:50,780
They're always so arrogant.

481
00:27:51,322 --> 00:27:54,075
I'm Komori. Nice to meet you.

482
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,409
Uh, we're...

483
00:27:55,434 --> 00:27:56,226
Whoa!

484
00:27:56,427 --> 00:27:58,679
You don't have to tell me.

485
00:27:58,704 --> 00:28:03,209
We all have a thing or two
we keep hidden, eh?

486
00:28:04,897 --> 00:28:08,143
Komori, we want to go
to the Village of Tobari.

487
00:28:08,339 --> 00:28:10,841
Do you know of a way
to get past the checkpoint?

488
00:28:11,241 --> 00:28:13,201
Now that's a tough question
to answer.

489
00:28:13,457 --> 00:28:15,959
But why do you want to go there?

490
00:28:16,138 --> 00:28:17,931
We've got some minor business
to take care of.

491
00:28:19,462 --> 00:28:20,383
Someone's here!

492
00:28:30,769 --> 00:28:32,562
What? It's just a mouse.

493
00:28:32,816 --> 00:28:34,529
Don't scare me like that!

494
00:28:36,242 --> 00:28:39,662
What don't you understand
about waiting until we find a way

495
00:28:39,687 --> 00:28:41,731
to get through the checkpoint?

496
00:28:42,123 --> 00:28:45,793
Like, if we take our time,
we'll lose the chance to kill Gengo!

497
00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:48,222
It's too dangerous to go alone.

498
00:28:48,432 --> 00:28:50,518
You are not to act alone!

499
00:28:51,966 --> 00:28:55,386
I just want to,
like, prove my ability.

500
00:28:55,469 --> 00:28:58,889
And I won't be held back
by stupid rules!

501
00:28:58,973 --> 00:29:00,224
Grow up!

502
00:29:00,367 --> 00:29:03,072
This isn't some kind of game!

503
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,868
What a drag.

504
00:29:04,895 --> 00:29:05,980
What?!

505
00:29:06,147 --> 00:29:10,151
Maybe I'll have more freedom
in the Land of Silence.

506
00:29:10,418 --> 00:29:12,704
You mustn't say
such reckless things.

507
00:29:13,243 --> 00:29:15,138
Hey, you're not...

508
00:29:15,748 --> 00:29:18,165
getting any weird ideas, are you?

509
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,829
Deserting the village is
a serious crime.

510
00:29:21,912 --> 00:29:24,206
Rogue ninja are hunted down
to the ends of the earth

511
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:27,293
and are always punished to
the harshest extent of shinobi law.

512
00:29:27,918 --> 00:29:30,046
You're aware of that, aren't you?

513
00:29:31,631 --> 00:29:34,925
Shikamaru, Soku isn't serious.

514
00:29:35,276 --> 00:29:36,569
Isn't that so?

515
00:29:36,594 --> 00:29:38,220
Like I care!

516
00:29:38,435 --> 00:29:40,181
Hey, we're not done here!

517
00:29:47,897 --> 00:29:48,898
Oh?

518
00:29:49,586 --> 00:29:51,296
In a bad mood?

519
00:29:51,889 --> 00:29:53,974
Like, it's none of your business.

520
00:29:54,195 --> 00:29:56,146
I don't know what happened,

521
00:29:56,524 --> 00:29:58,484
but it's over if
you get discouraged.

522
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:02,686
Look at me.
I'm forced to do jobs like this...

523
00:30:03,315 --> 00:30:06,540
But one day, I'm going to have
a huge inn of my own!

524
00:30:07,173 --> 00:30:08,967
Like, no one asked you.

525
00:30:10,777 --> 00:30:11,847
That kid...

526
00:30:13,255 --> 00:30:16,258
I hope she knows what
she's supposed to do here.

527
00:30:16,746 --> 00:30:19,457
There's no need to worry
about Soku.

528
00:30:22,561 --> 00:30:26,369
I just wanted to, like,
make my power useful.

529
00:30:26,578 --> 00:30:29,372
So, you were a shinobi.

530
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:31,121
It's a secret.

531
00:30:31,259 --> 00:30:33,803
I-I know that!

532
00:30:34,402 --> 00:30:37,154
Everyone in the village
has gotten used to peace,

533
00:30:37,238 --> 00:30:39,281
and they're too timid.

534
00:30:39,657 --> 00:30:40,643
Like, at this rate,

535
00:30:40,668 --> 00:30:43,546
I should have just gone to
the Land of Silence.

536
00:30:43,823 --> 00:30:47,118
Surely, you're not going to
desert your village?

537
00:30:47,164 --> 00:30:49,583
Isn't that a serious crime?

538
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,656
Like, yeah, I know that.

539
00:30:55,256 --> 00:30:58,092
I feel a little better
after talking to you.

540
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,065
I'm going back to the guys.

541
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:00,799
I see...

542
00:31:01,262 --> 00:31:03,931
I'll come with you!

543
00:31:05,386 --> 00:31:07,805
You don't have to.

544
00:31:07,852 --> 00:31:10,187
I'm used to getting scolded,

545
00:31:10,212 --> 00:31:12,048
so I'm really good
at apologizing!

546
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:16,861
Ro, you saw her eyes too, right?

547
00:31:17,439 --> 00:31:19,271
You are overthinking this.

548
00:31:19,947 --> 00:31:22,913
If Soku is serious about
deserting the village...

549
00:31:23,284 --> 00:31:25,275
we have to silence her.

550
00:31:25,654 --> 00:31:26,560
Can you do it?

551
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:29,665
I'm asking you,
would you be able to do it?

552
00:31:29,915 --> 00:31:31,959
Desertion is a serious crime.

553
00:31:32,435 --> 00:31:35,252
If Soku is serious,

554
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,062
I will not hesitate.

555
00:31:41,301 --> 00:31:42,560
I knew it!

556
00:31:42,678 --> 00:31:45,222
Like, they're not comrades
or anything!

557
00:31:45,613 --> 00:31:46,614
Wait!

558
00:31:48,109 --> 00:31:49,110
Soku!

559
00:31:49,685 --> 00:31:52,813
I don't have a place
where I belong anymore.

560
00:31:54,515 --> 00:31:55,766
What if...

561
00:31:56,108 --> 00:31:58,694
I told you that
there's a safe route

562
00:31:58,778 --> 00:32:01,280
to get to the checkpoint
without being discovered?

563
00:32:01,989 --> 00:32:04,617
Are you willing to risk it?

564
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:13,267
<i>It's the long way,
but if you follow the river,</i>

565
00:32:13,292 --> 00:32:16,170
<i>you'll reach the checkpoint
without being seen.</i>

566
00:32:21,091 --> 00:32:22,092
Hey!

567
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,602
What are you doing here?

568
00:32:25,888 --> 00:32:29,789
U-Uh... I was looking for
the mouse that got away.

569
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:31,227
Have you seen Soku?

570
00:32:31,435 --> 00:32:34,355
I-I didn't see anything!

571
00:32:34,594 --> 00:32:36,262
What is going on?

572
00:32:37,365 --> 00:32:38,366
Hey!

573
00:32:38,775 --> 00:32:41,261
Look at me in the eye
and answer me again!

574
00:32:41,738 --> 00:32:43,073
Where did Soku go?

575
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,782
I'm tellin' you I don't know!

576
00:32:45,324 --> 00:32:46,242
Don't tell me...

577
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,088
Is she heading for
the checkpoint?

578
00:32:48,457 --> 00:32:49,750
Did she desert?

579
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:51,330
That's it, isn't it?

580
00:32:52,562 --> 00:32:54,229
That's inconceivable!

581
00:32:54,487 --> 00:32:55,948
Soku would not desert the village!

582
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,553
To find out, we need to catch Soku
and ask her directly.

583
00:33:05,444 --> 00:33:06,445
Stop!

584
00:33:06,717 --> 00:33:08,511
Why you—! Who are you?!

585
00:33:08,973 --> 00:33:10,391
I deserted my village!

586
00:33:10,894 --> 00:33:13,688
I want my skills to be of use here,
for this land!

587
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,447
If you interfere, you're dead!

588
00:33:27,074 --> 00:33:30,077
A rogue ninja?
A kid like you?

589
00:33:30,369 --> 00:33:34,331
Like, age doesn't matter.
Ability is everything.

590
00:33:34,521 --> 00:33:37,028
Well, at least you talk the talk!

591
00:33:50,545 --> 00:33:53,548
You won't walk away with just
a wound on your leg the next time.

592
00:33:54,095 --> 00:33:55,847
D-Don't take this the wrong way.

593
00:33:56,353 --> 00:33:59,565
We've had a lot of rats
sniffing around lately.

594
00:34:00,226 --> 00:34:01,561
Just recently...

595
00:34:02,192 --> 00:34:02,902
Yeah...

596
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,500
It was ANBU from
the Hidden Leaf.

597
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:09,742
You intend to desert
your village at your age?

598
00:34:10,442 --> 00:34:13,028
I'm just sick of
old-fashioned rules.

599
00:34:13,561 --> 00:34:14,597
Like, with my skills,

600
00:34:14,622 --> 00:34:16,665
you won't regret making me
one of you.

601
00:34:16,943 --> 00:34:19,451
Great! I like you!

602
00:34:20,075 --> 00:34:23,036
Well, you certainly have
an interesting technique.

603
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:28,297
Two of my men who were
on reconnaissance were just killed.

604
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:32,971
Your technique inflicts the same kind
of wound that killed them.

605
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,683
I wonder why?

606
00:34:35,601 --> 00:34:37,311
Would you care to explain?

607
00:34:39,605 --> 00:34:42,060
Things aren't looking good for you...

608
00:34:42,316 --> 00:34:43,609
are they, young lady?

609
00:34:45,903 --> 00:34:47,655
She's okay.

610
00:34:49,698 --> 00:34:50,699
Komori?

611
00:34:51,491 --> 00:34:53,126
Sorry I didn't say anything.

612
00:34:53,953 --> 00:34:58,036
I had to test you to make sure
we could trust you.

613
00:34:59,667 --> 00:35:01,961
She killed our comrades.

614
00:35:02,072 --> 00:35:03,198
We can't trust her.

615
00:35:03,312 --> 00:35:06,065
They attacked out of nowhere,
I had no choice.

616
00:35:06,423 --> 00:35:08,842
I had a fight with my partners,

617
00:35:08,867 --> 00:35:10,994
and I've made up
my mind to leave.

618
00:35:11,595 --> 00:35:15,099
Captain, I've watched her
all this time.

619
00:35:15,472 --> 00:35:17,557
She really did split off
from her group.

620
00:35:17,822 --> 00:35:20,618
But I can't just take
your word for it.

621
00:35:21,068 --> 00:35:22,319
Like, if you don't believe me,

622
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:25,324
I don't mind if we fight it out,
right here.

623
00:35:27,027 --> 00:35:28,612
We found you, Soku!

624
00:35:31,312 --> 00:35:34,872
So, you were pulling the strings,
all this time, Komori!

625
00:35:35,327 --> 00:35:37,621
You were pretty quick.

626
00:35:37,733 --> 00:35:39,883
But take a good look around you.

627
00:35:40,334 --> 00:35:42,419
There's no way you can win!

628
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:44,253
Hey!

629
00:35:44,253 --> 00:35:48,132
Even you understand the gravity
of deserting a village, don't you?

630
00:35:48,799 --> 00:35:51,343
Hand her over to us right now.

631
00:35:51,547 --> 00:35:53,902
If you interfere,
I won't go easy on you!

632
00:35:55,514 --> 00:35:58,350
Will you turn her over, or not?

633
00:36:00,811 --> 00:36:02,229
Interesting...

634
00:36:03,248 --> 00:36:07,252
This is your chance to prove
that you're serious.

635
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,137
I'll help you!

636
00:36:18,162 --> 00:36:19,413
I don't need your help!

637
00:36:19,724 --> 00:36:21,372
This is my problem!

638
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,977
Shikamaru,
I implore you to think it over!

639
00:36:28,451 --> 00:36:30,257
Soku has her reasons.

640
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,879
Don't be reckless!

641
00:36:31,904 --> 00:36:33,739
Are you going to betray me too?

642
00:36:33,836 --> 00:36:35,379
Y-You misunderstand!

643
00:36:36,555 --> 00:36:38,474
Then you're... first!

644
00:36:41,185 --> 00:36:43,312
Lord... Shikamaru!

645
00:36:44,188 --> 00:36:46,315
You two... together—!

646
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:01,330
Soku... You didn't...

647
00:37:22,567 --> 00:37:23,703
You did well!

648
00:37:30,234 --> 00:37:32,727
I don't sense any chakra.
He's dead.

649
00:37:34,113 --> 00:37:35,781
You did it, Soku!

650
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:39,785
You'll be quite useful. Come.

651
00:37:51,505 --> 00:37:54,341
You're one of us now.

652
00:37:55,259 --> 00:37:58,095
You'll have to go through
some rounds of questioning,

653
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:00,332
but you'll be released right away.

654
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,828
In exchange for the intel
that you possess—

655
00:38:06,687 --> 00:38:09,815
I'm going to have you, like,
sleep for a while.

656
00:38:20,701 --> 00:38:24,621
Damn it, that was rough!

657
00:38:25,205 --> 00:38:27,040
It went quite well.

658
00:38:27,374 --> 00:38:31,170
Soku said she'll make it
seem like we're dead.

659
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:33,172
But that hurt a lot.

660
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:35,644
We owe that kid some thanks too.

661
00:38:36,446 --> 00:38:37,835
<i>What? It's just a mouse.</i>

662
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:43,247
Earlier, I used chakra to fake
a shinobi's presence.

663
00:38:43,662 --> 00:38:46,540
And his unexpected reaction
was our lucky break.

664
00:38:47,186 --> 00:38:50,314
An ordinary kid wouldn't have
reacted to chakra like he did.

665
00:38:51,064 --> 00:38:54,651
And he performed unerringly
as we predicted.

666
00:38:55,944 --> 00:38:58,155
But what Soku bemoaned...

667
00:38:58,238 --> 00:39:00,282
She meant half of what she said.

668
00:39:00,991 --> 00:39:03,493
If she had been really serious,

669
00:39:03,577 --> 00:39:06,246
she could have killed us both
at any time.

670
00:39:06,271 --> 00:39:08,731
Were you not aware of that risk?

671
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:11,376
This thing about trust...

672
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:14,171
You have to have faith
in your partner first.

673
00:39:14,196 --> 00:39:15,948
Isn't that what I said before?

674
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,897
As I'd expected of you.

675
00:39:18,217 --> 00:39:21,261
But don't tell Soku.
Or it will just go to her head.

676
00:39:21,345 --> 00:39:22,930
Like, I just heard everything.

677
00:39:24,322 --> 00:39:26,908
Your logic's pretty naive, Shikamaru.

678
00:39:27,033 --> 00:39:28,368
What do you mean?

679
00:39:28,477 --> 00:39:31,188
Don't tell me you really
meant to hurt me?

680
00:39:31,292 --> 00:39:34,211
Like, I can try again.

681
00:39:35,901 --> 00:39:37,527
Maybe next time.

682
00:39:38,649 --> 00:39:40,692
Anyway, how's it going?

683
00:39:40,822 --> 00:39:42,449
I kept the lock open.

684
00:39:42,561 --> 00:39:44,522
As long as you return quickly,
no one will notice.

685
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,764
Perfect.

686
00:40:48,025 --> 00:40:50,361
Are you all right, Lord Shikamaru?

687
00:40:50,735 --> 00:40:53,488
I thought I might have
heard you groaning.

688
00:40:53,825 --> 00:40:56,703
I've been having
strange dreams lately.

689
00:40:57,026 --> 00:41:00,362
Don't tell me...
Is it some memory from the past?

690
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:02,456
You too?

691
00:41:03,374 --> 00:41:07,670
The memories one wishes to forget most
tend to stick like glue.

692
00:41:08,046 --> 00:41:09,923
It must be old age.

693
00:41:11,596 --> 00:41:13,514
I'm only 19!

694
00:41:14,677 --> 00:41:15,928
Have you noticed?

695
00:41:16,496 --> 00:41:19,832
Even since we came here,
there's been no wind.

696
00:41:20,808 --> 00:41:23,352
Yes, it's totally still.

697
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:26,439
I don't have a good feeling
about this at all.

698
00:41:26,911 --> 00:41:30,289
<i>Hope she's faking
her death smoothly.</i>

699
00:41:31,652 --> 00:41:33,946
To be killed with her own jutsu...

700
00:41:34,982 --> 00:41:36,567
Talk about luck.

701
00:41:36,782 --> 00:41:39,785
Anyone foolish enough to get killed
during an initiation test...

702
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:41,520
wouldn't have been any good.

703
00:41:45,666 --> 00:41:47,626
You don't have to worry about Soku.

704
00:41:53,917 --> 00:41:55,147
What is it?

705
00:41:55,259 --> 00:41:58,721
Intel on Gengo, the guy
that controls this village.

706
00:41:58,959 --> 00:42:02,647
Looks like it was collected by ANBU.
Want to read it?

707
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:06,645
It's smart to know
about one's target.

708
00:42:07,188 --> 00:42:08,481
Let us see then.

709
00:42:11,753 --> 00:42:14,737
This is... blank!

710
00:42:15,112 --> 00:42:18,407
It means they couldn't learn
a single thing.

711
00:42:20,576 --> 00:42:22,244
Just this one sheet?

712
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:27,228
Ten shinobi lost their lives for that.

713
00:42:27,803 --> 00:42:29,352
It just doesn't make sense.

714
00:42:29,752 --> 00:42:30,836
Let me have that.

715
00:42:34,158 --> 00:42:37,051
I think it will be more useful
in the fire.

716
00:42:53,025 --> 00:42:55,361
Oh, the dead have returned.

717
00:42:56,158 --> 00:42:57,869
Looks like you pulled it off.

718
00:42:58,213 --> 00:43:00,591
Pretending to be dead is like, creepy.

719
00:43:00,658 --> 00:43:04,912
Otherwise, you would have become
a shinobi of this land.

720
00:43:05,371 --> 00:43:06,997
You should be happy...

721
00:43:07,223 --> 00:43:09,600
Now you can move around freely.

722
00:43:09,906 --> 00:43:11,950
So? Did you learn anything?

723
00:43:12,461 --> 00:43:14,580
Regarding Gengo, we have,
like, nothing.

724
00:43:14,908 --> 00:43:17,619
And no one knows anything about
the inside of the castle.

725
00:43:18,259 --> 00:43:22,449
It seems the man known as Gengo
rarely appears before others.

726
00:43:22,596 --> 00:43:24,139
I learned one thing though.

727
00:43:24,181 --> 00:43:27,226
That castle is known
as Fushu Castle.

728
00:43:27,518 --> 00:43:28,561
Fushu?

729
00:43:28,561 --> 00:43:30,604
As in prisoners of war...

730
00:43:30,688 --> 00:43:32,982
A derogatory term used by
the mainstream for savage tribes

731
00:43:33,107 --> 00:43:34,608
along the border.

732
00:43:34,906 --> 00:43:40,578
Like, I can't believe anyone would
name their own castle such a name.

733
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:42,575
What of Sai?

734
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,310
Nothing at all.

735
00:43:44,403 --> 00:43:47,782
Tsk... Well, it seems this Gengo
is a very cautious man.

736
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:51,250
He's worth looking into.

737
00:43:52,209 --> 00:43:55,379
Okay, why don't we go
have some yakiniku...

738
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:04,722
Hey Pops! You call this yakiniku?

739
00:44:05,222 --> 00:44:07,349
You can leave if you got
any complaints!

740
00:44:07,481 --> 00:44:09,525
I didn't say I wasn't going to eat it!

741
00:44:09,727 --> 00:44:11,562
Everyone's short of supplies.

742
00:44:11,562 --> 00:44:12,980
That's way better than nothing!

743
00:44:14,493 --> 00:44:16,787
Like, there are guys from
all over the place.

744
00:44:17,151 --> 00:44:20,738
People without money are probably
lured here by these requests.

745
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,569
How long since
you opened up shop?

746
00:44:25,012 --> 00:44:28,829
About the same time Gengo came,
so around ten years.

747
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:32,148
This village was doing
worse back then.

748
00:44:32,869 --> 00:44:34,788
This Gengo fellow is
an outsider too?

749
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:37,546
He and his gang showed up
out of the blue,

750
00:44:37,572 --> 00:44:39,991
and kicked out
the domineering Feudal Lord.

751
00:44:40,246 --> 00:44:43,624
Feudal Lords are all useless.

752
00:44:43,666 --> 00:44:46,126
And did living conditions improve?

753
00:44:46,305 --> 00:44:49,350
Well, what do you think?
Take a look around!

754
00:44:49,739 --> 00:44:51,160
They're all Gengo's followers.

755
00:44:51,185 --> 00:44:53,395
They boss everyone around.

756
00:44:53,646 --> 00:44:56,148
It was great that he kicked out
the Feudal Lord...

757
00:44:56,173 --> 00:44:58,340
but after that, he just took over.

758
00:45:00,712 --> 00:45:02,922
I've seen that face somewhere...

759
00:45:02,947 --> 00:45:06,116
I was just thinking the same thing.

760
00:45:22,104 --> 00:45:23,525
There's no mistake.

761
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:26,136
That is Minoichi,
a former member of the ANBU.

762
00:45:26,261 --> 00:45:29,515
I totally thought
he'd died somewhere.

763
00:45:29,815 --> 00:45:31,733
I don't remember anyone
like him.

764
00:45:32,164 --> 00:45:37,252
Well, no wonder.
This was during the last Great War.

765
00:45:37,314 --> 00:45:42,695
He killed everyone in his unit
and went into hiding.

766
00:45:43,821 --> 00:45:46,740
Damn it, I can't stand
the sight of him.

767
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:50,452
So, like, what's he doing here,
acting so high and mighty?

768
00:45:50,953 --> 00:45:53,789
Well, we'll have to ask him
that directly.

769
00:46:12,016 --> 00:46:13,642
Wh-Who are you guys?!

770
00:46:13,667 --> 00:46:16,420
You can't run away anymore,
Minoichi.

771
00:46:16,687 --> 00:46:18,981
I-I don't know that name!

772
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,441
Don't play dumb with me!

773
00:46:25,052 --> 00:46:26,524
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu!

774
00:46:27,656 --> 00:46:29,742
Clearly, you remember it...

775
00:46:30,003 --> 00:46:32,261
If you're from Hidden Leaf Village.

776
00:46:32,286 --> 00:46:34,830
you know just what this jutsu
can do, don't you?!

777
00:46:34,872 --> 00:46:36,290
S-Stop!

778
00:46:36,749 --> 00:46:38,417
You've moved up in the world,

779
00:46:38,442 --> 00:46:40,361
considering you killed
all your comrades.

780
00:46:40,508 --> 00:46:43,302
Don't think you can get away
from shinobi law!

781
00:46:43,648 --> 00:46:45,723
I-I'm not a shinobi anymore!

782
00:46:46,106 --> 00:46:47,401
I'm a revolutionary!

783
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:48,736
A revolutionary?

784
00:46:48,761 --> 00:46:51,597
All of you living your idle lives
in the stagnant world of shinobi

785
00:46:51,783 --> 00:46:55,117
couldn't possibly understand
our noble intentions!

786
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,244
Enough of your stupid arguments!

787
00:46:57,269 --> 00:46:59,772
Or do you want me to
kill you right here?

788
00:47:00,647 --> 00:47:01,732
S-Stop!

789
00:47:05,611 --> 00:47:07,321
Now answer me!

790
00:47:07,389 --> 00:47:09,599
Tell me all you know
about this guy, Gengo!

791
00:47:09,779 --> 00:47:11,306
Start talking!

792
00:47:16,495 --> 00:47:17,722
Shikamaru!

793
00:47:25,631 --> 00:47:31,720
Revolutionaries... earn that title when
they have had their eyes opened by

794
00:47:31,987 --> 00:47:35,758
Lord Gengo's divine will.

795
00:47:36,072 --> 00:47:38,533
That's pretty lofty talk.

796
00:47:39,581 --> 00:47:43,632
This land does not need lowly men
like Feudal Lords.

797
00:47:44,033 --> 00:47:47,662
We will create the ideal society
for the shinobi.

798
00:47:47,687 --> 00:47:51,774
That's the true revolution
envisioned by Lord Gengo.

799
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:55,069
Lord Sai of the Hidden Leaf is supposedly
being held captive here.

800
00:47:55,723 --> 00:47:57,641
Will you tell us where he is?

801
00:48:00,128 --> 00:48:02,596
You're Ro, aren't you?

802
00:48:07,792 --> 00:48:09,836
Who cares about shinobi law?!

803
00:48:10,151 --> 00:48:13,112
I've had enough of dying for
the sake of Feudal Lords!

804
00:48:13,137 --> 00:48:16,431
I'll do anything to protect myself!

805
00:48:16,557 --> 00:48:17,247
Tsk...

806
00:48:17,272 --> 00:48:18,999
At last, you revealed your true self.

807
00:48:19,309 --> 00:48:23,689
A coward like you would
understand how I feel, right, Ro?

808
00:48:23,714 --> 00:48:25,800
D-Don't!

809
00:48:26,292 --> 00:48:27,835
What are you talking about?!

810
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:31,483
Don't you know what he did?

811
00:48:41,344 --> 00:48:43,517
That pressure point paralyzes
the whole body.

812
00:48:43,542 --> 00:48:45,252
He'll be out for a while.

813
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:46,461
Ro!

814
00:48:46,972 --> 00:48:48,390
Are you okay, Ro?!

815
00:48:49,548 --> 00:48:50,507
Ro!

816
00:49:24,166 --> 00:49:25,250
You're up.

817
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:27,841
Like, you had me worried.

818
00:49:29,171 --> 00:49:32,090
I was... dreaming.

819
00:49:33,827 --> 00:49:36,370
It's okay if you don't want to
talk about it.

820
00:49:38,263 --> 00:49:41,475
It's funny how the memories
one wishes to forget most

821
00:49:41,516 --> 00:49:43,894
tend to stick like glue.

822
00:49:45,028 --> 00:49:48,239
It was back when
I was still a Genin.

823
00:49:49,399 --> 00:49:54,863
My unit was ambushed by
the enemy and... annihilated.

824
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:00,786
I was the lone survivor,

825
00:50:01,018 --> 00:50:04,814
so I buried myself under
the corpses of my comrades...

826
00:50:04,839 --> 00:50:08,426
and I suppressed my chakra for days,
pretending to be dead.

827
00:50:09,294 --> 00:50:11,797
Thanks to the jutsu I mastered
during that time,

828
00:50:11,964 --> 00:50:14,675
I was picked up by the ANBU.

829
00:50:14,775 --> 00:50:18,195
But this jutsu is a cursed power...

830
00:50:18,363 --> 00:50:20,490
acquired from the slaughter
of my comrades.

831
00:50:21,631 --> 00:50:23,759
The same thing happened to me...

832
00:50:24,643 --> 00:50:27,646
The revolutionaries are like,
gathering in the square.

833
00:50:31,125 --> 00:50:32,918
They're planning something.

834
00:50:33,235 --> 00:50:34,736
Let's go.

835
00:50:36,014 --> 00:50:39,355
But we can't go looking like this.

836
00:50:42,703 --> 00:50:44,663
We need like, two more.

837
00:50:54,055 --> 00:50:57,016
Ro, is the chakra disguise ready?

838
00:50:57,328 --> 00:51:00,621
I've already traced
the clothing's owner.

839
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:03,648
Soku, we're counting on you
if anything happens.

840
00:51:04,975 --> 00:51:06,685
Soku, are you listening?

841
00:51:07,185 --> 00:51:08,214
Hey, you!

842
00:51:17,892 --> 00:51:19,413
Fix that collar!

843
00:51:19,738 --> 00:51:22,159
Lord Gengo is going
to address us!

844
00:51:22,242 --> 00:51:23,869
Shape up!

845
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:25,481
I'm sorry.

846
00:51:25,783 --> 00:51:28,558
If you're not doing anything,
help with the preparations!

847
00:51:29,014 --> 00:51:29,875
Understood?

848
00:51:30,694 --> 00:51:33,238
Perfect timing, wasn't it?

849
00:51:33,592 --> 00:51:36,303
It almost seems too perfect...

850
00:51:37,166 --> 00:51:41,671
But we can't pass up this opportunity
if Gengo's going to appear.

851
00:51:47,231 --> 00:51:50,359
From this spot, we can get Gengo,
no matter where he tries to hide.

852
00:51:52,022 --> 00:51:54,691
Soku, stay alert.
You've been spacing out.

853
00:51:55,192 --> 00:51:56,906
What Minoichi was saying...

854
00:51:56,931 --> 00:51:57,674
Huh?

855
00:51:58,195 --> 00:52:01,782
Kick out the Feudal Lords and
create the ideal world for shinobi.

856
00:52:02,449 --> 00:52:05,410
It's not a bad idea.

857
00:52:06,036 --> 00:52:08,330
What are you saying?

858
00:52:08,622 --> 00:52:12,099
I like, just can't accept this system

859
00:52:12,261 --> 00:52:14,753
with useless Feudal Lords
at the top.

860
00:52:15,116 --> 00:52:18,248
Don't deny ever thinking that too, Ro!

861
00:52:20,592 --> 00:52:22,761
I get where you're coming from.

862
00:52:22,986 --> 00:52:25,322
But focus on the mission right now.

863
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:28,801
Distraction leads to mistakes.

864
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,532
Like I need to be reminded.

865
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:46,676
The stage is undefended...

866
00:52:47,177 --> 00:52:50,405
Either this Gengo is
really confident,

867
00:52:50,571 --> 00:52:52,532
or really stupid.

868
00:52:56,783 --> 00:52:58,794
He's finally going to appear.

869
00:52:59,156 --> 00:53:01,617
Let's expose this guy
for what he really is!

870
00:53:09,392 --> 00:53:14,689
First, I thank everyone who
has come together here.

871
00:53:18,806 --> 00:53:19,740
Everyone...

872
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:24,014
The day is near for true revolution!

873
00:53:26,844 --> 00:53:29,130
We'll have a better chance of catching
Gengo with Shadow Stitching

874
00:53:29,155 --> 00:53:31,235
if we move up closer.

875
00:53:31,997 --> 00:53:33,081
Follow me.

876
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:37,294
Tonight, I've planned
something special.

877
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:44,176
Allow me to introduce someone who tried
to obstruct our true revolution!

878
00:53:58,693 --> 00:53:59,577
Sai!

879
00:54:03,071 --> 00:54:05,754
Everyone... What fate awaits this man?

880
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,122
Death!

881
00:54:07,491 --> 00:54:09,743
A sacrifice for our revolution!

882
00:54:12,725 --> 00:54:15,853
Your wishes have been heard.

883
00:54:16,541 --> 00:54:18,886
With the red blood of this man,

884
00:54:19,169 --> 00:54:23,423
the true revolution for justice
will take another leap forward!

885
00:54:29,674 --> 00:54:32,176
Are you going to ignore Lord Sai?!

886
00:54:32,944 --> 00:54:35,455
We're helpless against that crowd.

887
00:54:36,317 --> 00:54:37,444
I'm going to use this.

888
00:54:38,414 --> 00:54:40,315
A diversion?

889
00:54:40,769 --> 00:54:43,226
Ten years have passed quickly
since I rose up in this land.

890
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:48,533
Many comrades have joined me
and this land has started to flourish.

891
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:50,331
However...!

892
00:54:50,608 --> 00:54:55,571
Not a single one of
our hopes has yet been realized.

893
00:55:01,725 --> 00:55:04,520
I want to ask the citizens
of the Land of Silence!

894
00:55:04,881 --> 00:55:07,020
This land under the rule
of the Feudal Lord...

895
00:55:07,634 --> 00:55:11,151
and this land now—
Which world is better to live in?

896
00:55:11,691 --> 00:55:13,340
Feudal Lords who have
nowhere near

897
00:55:13,365 --> 00:55:17,202
our strength or intelligence
have ruled over the shinobi.

898
00:55:17,364 --> 00:55:19,783
But that dark age is a thing of the past.

899
00:55:20,129 --> 00:55:23,132
We, the revolutionaries,
will protect this land!

900
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:27,866
The wish of the revolutionaries
is to push forward

901
00:55:28,306 --> 00:55:30,066
to make this land rich
and prosperous!

902
00:55:30,091 --> 00:55:30,827
Damn it!

903
00:55:30,972 --> 00:55:34,261
The ones who should rule this land
are not the Feudal Lords...

904
00:55:34,716 --> 00:55:36,806
but we who possess
the power of shinobi!

905
00:55:36,831 --> 00:55:37,623
Hey, Ro!

906
00:55:37,648 --> 00:55:39,817
– This is no time to daydream!
– The shinobi is the key...

907
00:55:40,125 --> 00:55:42,168
– Snap out of it!
– to make this land safe and just.

908
00:55:42,978 --> 00:55:43,854
Shikamaru!

909
00:55:44,129 --> 00:55:46,464
– I was...
– It's been ten years since

910
00:55:47,627 --> 00:55:49,504
I'm going to rescue Sai.

911
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:52,679
When you see me go around
the back, lay it on real thick.

912
00:55:52,704 --> 00:55:53,747
Got it?!

913
00:55:54,375 --> 00:55:55,709
Understood!

914
00:55:57,726 --> 00:56:00,812
Why must shinobi
be treated differently?

915
00:56:02,814 --> 00:56:05,109
Why must we
be discriminated against?

916
00:56:08,357 --> 00:56:09,358
Damn it!

917
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:11,434
He's using some weird trick!

918
00:56:13,652 --> 00:56:16,029
Shinobi locked in the old ways,
content with their lot

919
00:56:16,054 --> 00:56:19,078
content with discrimination,
content to be controlled, destroyed us!

920
00:56:20,542 --> 00:56:21,525
Now hear me!

921
00:56:21,744 --> 00:56:24,413
People of the Land of Silence
awaiting the dawn...

922
00:56:24,878 --> 00:56:29,966
The sunlight of a new era shines
on the Land of Silence!

923
00:56:41,645 --> 00:56:43,772
So, you've shown yourself, rat.

924
00:56:44,356 --> 00:56:46,107
Your performance is over!

925
00:56:46,324 --> 00:56:48,201
Protect Lord Gengo!

926
00:56:49,194 --> 00:56:51,529
Lord Gengo, please take cover!

927
00:56:54,348 --> 00:56:56,099
Sai, I've come to get you.

928
00:56:56,126 --> 00:56:58,211
You'd better not be dead.

929
00:57:22,852 --> 00:57:24,006
Cut it out, Sai!

930
00:57:24,102 --> 00:57:25,979
I'm here to save you.

931
00:57:29,734 --> 00:57:31,778
I've woken up.

932
00:57:32,453 --> 00:57:34,497
You will soon
understand too, Shikamaru.

933
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:38,896
Sai, you!

934
00:57:39,744 --> 00:57:42,629
Gengo, is this your doing?

935
00:57:43,522 --> 00:57:48,168
How a shinobi of your stature would
be bound by old-fashioned laws,

936
00:57:49,462 --> 00:57:51,631
is beyond my comprehension.

937
00:57:56,761 --> 00:57:58,086
Shut up! Shut up!

938
00:58:00,353 --> 00:58:02,480
Why do you suppress
your memories?

939
00:58:02,851 --> 00:58:05,061
Are you afraid to face them?

940
00:58:05,145 --> 00:58:07,706
You're not fooling me with
your pretentious talk!

941
00:58:09,318 --> 00:58:11,069
Soku, do it!

942
00:58:18,444 --> 00:58:19,696
Too bad.

943
00:58:20,046 --> 00:58:22,400
Don't you dare do anything
to my comrades!

944
00:58:22,996 --> 00:58:25,457
Do anything to them?
Of course, not.

945
00:58:25,622 --> 00:58:29,626
I happen to like shinobi
with abilities.

946
00:58:37,677 --> 00:58:40,722
And of course, you happen
to be one of them,

947
00:58:41,264 --> 00:58:45,226
genius of the Hidden Leaf,
Shikamaru Nara.

948
00:58:53,592 --> 00:58:54,719
It's no use.

949
00:58:55,091 --> 00:58:57,385
Shikamaru, you must wake up too.

950
00:58:57,656 --> 00:58:59,157
Stop messing around!

951
00:58:59,297 --> 00:59:05,178
I just hate getting woken up
when I'm fast asleep!

952
00:59:13,046 --> 00:59:14,422
<i>Farewell...</i>

953
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:59,638
Silver-4c, pawn-3f, rook-4b, rook-4h,

954
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:06,079
bishop-3f, pawn-1f, pawn-1d,
pawn-2f, king-6b...

955
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:13,318
King-6h, king-7b, king-7h, silver-6b...

956
01:00:21,895 --> 01:00:23,731
You're really hanging in there.

957
01:00:25,414 --> 01:00:28,542
The average shinobi would
have given up long ago.

958
01:00:29,465 --> 01:00:32,718
I'm busy playing shogi
with past masters.

959
01:00:32,906 --> 01:00:35,075
I don't have time to get bored.

960
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:37,603
I like your stubbornness.

961
01:00:38,427 --> 01:00:40,762
You can learn a lot from shogi.

962
01:00:41,199 --> 01:00:45,251
No matter what position you're in,
there's always a way out.

963
01:00:45,684 --> 01:00:47,853
Are you planning on
getting out of this situation?

964
01:00:48,479 --> 01:00:49,688
I look forward to seeing that.

965
01:00:50,397 --> 01:00:53,484
Hey, can you at least
give me back my lighter?

966
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:55,444
I just can't calm down
without it.

967
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:59,781
Sure, when you decide to
accept Lord Gengo's beliefs.

968
01:01:00,679 --> 01:01:02,801
Why would you follow
a guy like that?

969
01:01:03,002 --> 01:01:06,038
Let's just say I found
the place where I belong.

970
01:01:06,199 --> 01:01:07,992
And that wasn't
the Hidden Leaf Village.

971
01:01:08,307 --> 01:01:11,185
Weren't you a member of Team 7?

972
01:01:11,502 --> 01:01:13,629
Then why didn't Naruto come?

973
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:17,758
You and I aren't close,
so why did you come?

974
01:01:18,602 --> 01:01:21,772
Naruto knows nothing
about this situation.

975
01:01:22,513 --> 01:01:24,056
This was all my decision.

976
01:01:24,721 --> 01:01:28,018
Even still, if this had been
Sasuke or Sakura,

977
01:01:28,243 --> 01:01:29,983
surely Naruto would have come...

978
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:33,731
I bet Gengo put those ideas
in your head, right?

979
01:01:35,012 --> 01:01:38,242
There's no doubt that
Gengo controls people with words.

980
01:01:38,487 --> 01:01:40,339
So why don't you snap out
of it and wake up?

981
01:01:40,745 --> 01:01:42,472
I woke up a long time ago.

982
01:01:42,848 --> 01:01:45,590
When Lord Gengo gave me a will.

983
01:01:50,334 --> 01:01:51,335
Wait.

984
01:01:52,098 --> 01:01:53,474
Do you still have more to say?

985
01:01:53,925 --> 01:01:58,081
I promise I'm going to undo
Gengo's jutsu and save you.

986
01:02:00,472 --> 01:02:02,391
I'd resign myself if I were you.

987
01:02:04,139 --> 01:02:06,892
Otherwise, things will get much worse.

988
01:02:12,831 --> 01:02:14,791
You're a member of the Hidden Leaf.

989
01:02:14,817 --> 01:02:16,277
Don't forget that!

990
01:02:29,873 --> 01:02:32,793
Pawn-4e, bishop-3c...

991
01:02:33,161 --> 01:02:34,579
Knight-3g...

992
01:02:34,901 --> 01:02:35,943
Nope...

993
01:02:36,039 --> 01:02:38,249
I don't have enough pieces right now.

994
01:02:38,274 --> 01:02:40,067
The king's going to get away.

995
01:02:45,811 --> 01:02:47,247
Ro! Is that you?!

996
01:02:47,656 --> 01:02:50,492
That voice... Is it you, Lord Shikamaru?

997
01:02:50,517 --> 01:02:51,518
Hey Gengo!

998
01:02:51,898 --> 01:02:54,609
These guys were just
obeying my orders!

999
01:02:54,723 --> 01:02:56,510
If you're going to kill someone,
kill me!

1000
01:02:57,983 --> 01:03:00,902
Remember, as long as you live,
there's a chance.

1001
01:03:01,093 --> 01:03:02,315
Don't give up!

1002
01:03:02,656 --> 01:03:05,617
I won't let you give up and die!

1003
01:03:06,624 --> 01:03:08,201
Worry not.

1004
01:03:08,226 --> 01:03:10,645
This is nothing...

1005
01:03:11,564 --> 01:03:14,149
What happened to Soku?
Wasn't she with you?

1006
01:03:14,438 --> 01:03:15,857
She's okay, isn't she?!

1007
01:03:19,588 --> 01:03:22,942
<i>Why do you insist on
serving Feudal Lords</i>

1008
01:03:22,967 --> 01:03:25,761
<i>and incompetent people
who oppress you?</i>

1009
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:28,472
Like, that's none of
your business!

1010
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:31,183
<i>Remember...</i>

1011
01:03:31,353 --> 01:03:33,176
<i>The way that those people
looked at you.</i>

1012
01:03:33,429 --> 01:03:35,264
<i>What did you see deep
inside their eyes?</i>

1013
01:03:35,687 --> 01:03:37,606
Like, I don't remember!

1014
01:03:37,748 --> 01:03:39,207
<i>Sure, you do.</i>

1015
01:03:39,384 --> 01:03:42,179
<i>The truth is, it's stuck to your mind
and won't go away. Isn't that so?</i>

1016
01:03:44,423 --> 01:03:45,549
<i>Remember!</i>

1017
01:03:45,574 --> 01:03:47,743
<i>The eyes that looked at you.</i>

1018
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:50,911
The suspicious eyes
that feared me,

1019
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:53,448
and tried to discriminate against me...

1020
01:03:54,456 --> 01:04:00,504
<i>Why must you give your proud and
mighty life for people like that?</i>

1021
01:04:00,846 --> 01:04:05,373
<i>Why pledge loyalty to those
who hold you in bondage?</i>

1022
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:08,553
They are using me.

1023
01:04:10,869 --> 01:04:12,454
<i>Everyone is an enemy.</i>

1024
01:04:13,744 --> 01:04:15,477
<i>There is nothing to fear.</i>

1025
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:16,520
<i>Now, turn.</i>

1026
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:18,689
<i>And accept everything.</i>

1027
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:29,908
A purpose has been granted.

1028
01:04:57,978 --> 01:05:00,313
I've brought him, Lord Gengo...

1029
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:04,568
My apologies for
the inhospitable treatment.

1030
01:05:04,919 --> 01:05:07,510
As you know,
I can't let down my guard.

1031
01:05:07,899 --> 01:05:09,817
I have no intention
of speaking to you.

1032
01:05:10,125 --> 01:05:12,920
It's obvious you're trying
to control me with your words.

1033
01:05:13,123 --> 01:05:16,084
You're starting to look
like your father.

1034
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:20,125
Forgive me, but I looked
into your background.

1035
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:21,568
Your family and friends...

1036
01:05:22,185 --> 01:05:25,480
And the fact that
you came here to kill me.

1037
01:05:27,593 --> 01:05:30,388
Why do you people
keep oppressing us?

1038
01:05:30,877 --> 01:05:32,754
When did we do that?

1039
01:05:33,138 --> 01:05:34,973
This land is feeble.

1040
01:05:35,070 --> 01:05:39,032
We barely have natural resources
and the soil is barren,

1041
01:05:39,187 --> 01:05:42,231
yet we are trying
our hardest to survive. That is all.

1042
01:05:42,256 --> 01:05:45,425
Yeah right, all the while
you're gathering up rogue ninja...

1043
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:46,717
What's your motive?

1044
01:05:46,903 --> 01:05:48,822
Are you planning on starting a war?

1045
01:05:48,969 --> 01:05:50,777
I'm not gathering them.

1046
01:05:51,255 --> 01:05:54,633
They come to me,
seeking salvation.

1047
01:05:55,241 --> 01:05:56,386
Salvation?!

1048
01:05:57,292 --> 01:06:01,338
Have you never questioned
the current existence of shinobi?

1049
01:06:01,895 --> 01:06:03,126
Without war,

1050
01:06:03,151 --> 01:06:06,198
they are no more than hunting dogs
for Feudal Lords and the rich.

1051
01:06:06,223 --> 01:06:08,433
Is that truly a fitting life
for a shinobi?

1052
01:06:09,174 --> 01:06:10,717
What is it that
you're trying to say?

1053
01:06:10,899 --> 01:06:16,864
They come here because
they want to be real shinobi.

1054
01:06:17,274 --> 01:06:20,027
The alliance of nations
to maintain a dark peace...

1055
01:06:20,052 --> 01:06:22,763
and bind shinobi with
meaningless laws.

1056
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:26,283
But there will always
be those who reject it.

1057
01:06:26,713 --> 01:06:29,740
This land is merely
the gathering place for them.

1058
01:06:30,321 --> 01:06:34,032
Various rules are necessary
to preserve peace.

1059
01:06:34,223 --> 01:06:36,450
The peace you speak of
is nothing but a theory,

1060
01:06:36,663 --> 01:06:38,457
forced upon us
by the Great Nations.

1061
01:06:38,662 --> 01:06:41,873
The Tailed Beasts that
you keep are proof of that.

1062
01:06:43,023 --> 01:06:44,774
Had you used one,

1063
01:06:44,905 --> 01:06:46,990
this land would be
completely helpless.

1064
01:06:47,212 --> 01:06:48,338
Isn't that so?

1065
01:06:48,967 --> 01:06:52,859
We have no intention of ever using
a Tailed Beast for war again.

1066
01:06:52,884 --> 01:06:55,567
You keep the Tailed Beast
for yourselves,

1067
01:06:55,592 --> 01:06:57,886
and you expect us to believe that?

1068
01:06:58,598 --> 01:07:01,643
Isn't that the biggest excuse
by the Great Nations?

1069
01:07:01,763 --> 01:07:03,264
Quit jumping to conclusions.

1070
01:07:03,763 --> 01:07:05,121
Then how about this?

1071
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:08,041
Give this land a Tailed Beast too.

1072
01:07:09,234 --> 01:07:12,237
I'm sure the Hidden Cloud
has an extra one, correct?

1073
01:07:13,003 --> 01:07:16,715
Then we wouldn't worry,
and we would believe you.

1074
01:07:16,798 --> 01:07:18,550
You know we can't do that.

1075
01:07:18,827 --> 01:07:20,328
Of course not.

1076
01:07:20,528 --> 01:07:22,781
You espouse peace openly...

1077
01:07:22,933 --> 01:07:28,854
but deep down, you don't trust
small countries like ours.

1078
01:07:29,110 --> 01:07:32,549
But you can't make the argument
for war because of that.

1079
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:34,926
There's got to be another solution.

1080
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:37,512
You need another solution?

1081
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:39,469
Come with me.

1082
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:42,475
I'd like to show you something...

1083
01:08:13,381 --> 01:08:14,466
What is this?

1084
01:08:14,825 --> 01:08:19,329
Agricultural crops can't grow
at our elevation.

1085
01:08:19,471 --> 01:08:23,558
The people live in poverty
with little to eat.

1086
01:08:24,361 --> 01:08:28,188
If we just had some kind of product,
something to enrich their lives...

1087
01:08:28,396 --> 01:08:31,858
This flower is the result
of selective breeding.

1088
01:08:33,401 --> 01:08:36,363
You've seen it here and there,
haven't you?

1089
01:08:37,589 --> 01:08:39,340
But it was all for nothing...

1090
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:43,495
This flower wilts the moment
it's taken out of this village,

1091
01:08:43,578 --> 01:08:45,705
due to its unique environment.

1092
01:08:47,112 --> 01:08:49,698
Why did you choose
the way of the shinobi?

1093
01:08:50,712 --> 01:08:52,881
Was it to be chained to a desk
for the rest of your life?

1094
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:54,297
Who knows.

1095
01:08:56,333 --> 01:08:58,169
Most likely not.

1096
01:08:58,593 --> 01:09:02,138
You train daily to hone
your skills.

1097
01:09:02,401 --> 01:09:04,905
And with your skills,
you defeat the enemy,

1098
01:09:05,117 --> 01:09:06,952
to protect what is precious.

1099
01:09:07,177 --> 01:09:09,721
That is the way a shinobi
should live.

1100
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:13,307
That is the way your father
and mentor lived.

1101
01:09:16,444 --> 01:09:18,446
How would you know?!

1102
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:23,284
You probably hope that you can
measure up to them someday.

1103
01:09:23,618 --> 01:09:28,456
But in a world of peace,
can you really accomplish that?

1104
01:09:29,818 --> 01:09:32,127
It is because of war,

1105
01:09:32,152 --> 01:09:34,738
that shinobi abilities developed remarkably.

1106
01:09:35,018 --> 01:09:36,506
If there had been continual peace,

1107
01:09:36,690 --> 01:09:41,695
even you would never have spent
such worthwhile moments with your friends.

1108
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:43,388
Am I wrong?

1109
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:51,256
If that's the price for peace,

1110
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:53,982
I'll gladly throw down my weapons.

1111
01:09:54,566 --> 01:09:56,526
You're not speaking
from your heart.

1112
01:09:57,432 --> 01:10:01,186
<i>You feel your own abilities
weakening, don't you?</i>

1113
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:08,705
Shikamaru...

1114
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:11,583
Shut up!

1115
01:10:11,847 --> 01:10:13,098
Stay out of this.

1116
01:10:14,857 --> 01:10:17,560
Do not fear, Shikamaru.

1117
01:10:18,221 --> 01:10:19,681
Put your hand down.

1118
01:10:24,998 --> 01:10:26,666
Yes, that's it.

1119
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:29,391
First, why don't you calm down?

1120
01:10:29,476 --> 01:10:31,102
Take a deep breath.

1121
01:10:32,994 --> 01:10:34,481
Do you like it?

1122
01:10:34,802 --> 01:10:37,680
The scent of my precious flowers?

1123
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:40,528
Come on.

1124
01:10:40,795 --> 01:10:42,130
I get it...

1125
01:10:42,155 --> 01:10:43,615
So, that's it.

1126
01:10:49,833 --> 01:10:53,958
The scent of certain flowers has
the effect of stirring up memories.

1127
01:10:54,182 --> 01:10:56,893
So, that's what you've been
using to brainwash people.

1128
01:10:57,587 --> 01:10:59,422
What inconceivable will...

1129
01:10:59,447 --> 01:11:02,533
But that discovery won't
get you anywhere.

1130
01:11:02,669 --> 01:11:04,629
You cannot defy me.

1131
01:11:05,226 --> 01:11:07,972
Where are my comrades?!
Where are Ro and Soku?!

1132
01:11:08,223 --> 01:11:09,682
Bring them here!

1133
01:11:10,170 --> 01:11:12,119
We are right here.

1134
01:11:13,089 --> 01:11:14,885
Huh?! You two?!

1135
01:11:16,870 --> 01:11:20,485
Like, Lord Gengo has
given us the will...

1136
01:11:29,536 --> 01:11:32,580
Find him! Don't let him escape
from this castle!

1137
01:11:40,547 --> 01:11:43,675
Shikamaru, it's useless to hide.

1138
01:11:52,393 --> 01:11:54,229
I'm still numb...

1139
01:11:54,358 --> 01:11:56,068
Damn it, Soku!

1140
01:11:58,540 --> 01:11:59,917
I can't use my Shadows.

1141
01:12:00,092 --> 01:12:02,010
My rook and bishop
handicap is gone, too.

1142
01:12:02,035 --> 01:12:03,995
The situation is bleak.

1143
01:12:08,576 --> 01:12:09,952
<i>It's unlike you...</i>

1144
01:12:09,977 --> 01:12:12,021
<i>I can't believe you'd go
with the Climbing Silver.</i>

1145
01:12:12,046 --> 01:12:14,590
<i>It's using an advance unit
to break through enemy lines.</i>

1146
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:17,643
<i>You have to be ready to use tactics
like this once in a while...</i>

1147
01:12:19,751 --> 01:12:22,796
<i>If I escape now, the risk for
the Hidden Leaf will increase.</i>

1148
01:12:22,955 --> 01:12:24,915
<i>That's what you told me back then.</i>

1149
01:12:25,517 --> 01:12:27,894
<i>So, I guess that time
has come for me.</i>

1150
01:12:34,842 --> 01:12:35,843
Calm down.

1151
01:12:36,227 --> 01:12:38,938
There's still a chance
an opportunity will present itself.

1152
01:12:39,608 --> 01:12:43,236
<i>Shikamaru, presently,
you are the knight.</i>

1153
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:47,113
Breaking through the enemy camp
with a Climbing Silver or...

1154
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:49,684
perhaps a knight that jumps high...

1155
01:12:58,599 --> 01:13:00,351
Guess I have no choice

1156
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:02,837
but to jump back into
the den of the king.

1157
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:13,706
Lord Gengo, are you sure it's all right
to leave the search for Shikamaru to Sai?

1158
01:13:14,386 --> 01:13:16,930
Like, it will be bad if
he gets out of the castle.

1159
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,294
Don't panic.

1160
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:22,211
If he gets cornered,
he's the type

1161
01:13:22,393 --> 01:13:26,147
to throw himself into an even
more difficult situation.

1162
01:13:26,689 --> 01:13:28,024
Isn't that right, Shikamaru?

1163
01:13:31,721 --> 01:13:33,180
You knew I was here?

1164
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:34,480
That's no fun.

1165
01:13:36,043 --> 01:13:39,088
You wouldn't leave this behind.

1166
01:13:39,837 --> 01:13:41,589
You came back just for that?

1167
01:13:41,614 --> 01:13:42,949
You're something.

1168
01:13:43,298 --> 01:13:45,217
Resign yourself and be captured!

1169
01:13:54,017 --> 01:13:56,937
If the floor won't work,
there's always the ceiling.

1170
01:14:02,135 --> 01:14:03,287
Below.

1171
01:14:06,361 --> 01:14:07,612
My body...

1172
01:14:08,041 --> 01:14:09,023
Whoa...

1173
01:14:09,048 --> 01:14:11,800
Shikamaru, release me!

1174
01:14:11,855 --> 01:14:13,315
To break a genjutsu,

1175
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:15,717
the theory is to bring down
the one who placed it.

1176
01:14:16,077 --> 01:14:18,204
What do you say, Gengo?

1177
01:14:18,229 --> 01:14:19,179
Impossible.

1178
01:14:19,204 --> 01:14:21,491
No one can resist my words.

1179
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:23,685
Ro...

1180
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:26,254
Sorry, but you'll have to
be my shield for a while.

1181
01:14:26,310 --> 01:14:26,978
Shoot.

1182
01:14:27,128 --> 01:14:28,755
Don't worry about hitting Ro.

1183
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:29,832
Go ahead and shoot.

1184
01:14:29,857 --> 01:14:31,317
Just make sure you aim straight.

1185
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:40,585
Stop, Shikamaru.

1186
01:14:40,774 --> 01:14:42,568
You cannot resist my words.

1187
01:14:43,146 --> 01:14:44,559
Don't tell me you—?!

1188
01:14:45,150 --> 01:14:47,402
<i>You purposely let Soku
hit you in the ear</i>

1189
01:14:47,619 --> 01:14:49,996
<i>to dull your sense of hearing?!</i>

1190
01:14:51,031 --> 01:14:53,261
This is the knight's jump!

1191
01:15:02,468 --> 01:15:04,011
I'm disappointed, Shikamaru.

1192
01:15:04,298 --> 01:15:05,716
So disappointed.

1193
01:15:06,298 --> 01:15:07,920
Please stay back, Lord Gengo.

1194
01:15:07,945 --> 01:15:09,863
Leave this to me.

1195
01:15:10,131 --> 01:15:11,228
Well done!

1196
01:15:11,781 --> 01:15:12,866
Gengo!

1197
01:15:14,761 --> 01:15:16,220
You won't get away!

1198
01:15:20,898 --> 01:15:21,899
Damn it!

1199
01:15:37,365 --> 01:15:41,286
<i>Damn it, you keep
getting beaten up by girls.</i>

1200
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:46,484
<i>Weren't you going to become a better
leader for the sake of your comrades?</i>

1201
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:50,380
<i>Dad... I...</i>

1202
01:15:50,928 --> 01:15:53,218
<i>I'm just not cut out to
be a shinobi.</i>

1203
01:16:03,246 --> 01:16:04,831
Is he dead?

1204
01:16:04,910 --> 01:16:06,745
I didn't like, kill him yet.

1205
01:16:06,866 --> 01:16:09,490
Well, he had no chance
at the end.

1206
01:16:09,847 --> 01:16:11,081
How pitiful...

1207
01:16:11,916 --> 01:16:13,452
<i>I'm physically at my limit.</i>

1208
01:16:13,871 --> 01:16:15,728
<i>The air feels so heavy.</i>

1209
01:16:16,174 --> 01:16:18,281
<i>Man, this is such a drag.</i>

1210
01:16:26,814 --> 01:16:28,857
Are you okay, Shikamaru?

1211
01:16:28,981 --> 01:16:30,816
Don't you dare die on us!

1212
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:36,509
You guys?!

1213
01:16:37,046 --> 01:16:38,923
But what are you doing here?

1214
01:16:39,336 --> 01:16:41,422
Oh, I get it. I'm still dreaming...

1215
01:16:41,562 --> 01:16:42,695
Shikamaru!

1216
01:16:43,307 --> 01:16:44,684
T-Temari?!

1217
01:16:44,709 --> 01:16:47,253
I expect a lot more from you!

1218
01:16:47,278 --> 01:16:49,154
Why are you just sitting around
dazed like that?!

1219
01:16:49,308 --> 01:16:50,350
Shikamaru?!

1220
01:16:50,657 --> 01:16:51,908
Stop it, Temari!

1221
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:53,988
He'll really die.

1222
01:16:54,013 --> 01:16:55,139
Shut up!

1223
01:16:55,650 --> 01:16:58,945
That's for lying to me at
the Shinobi Alliance meeting.

1224
01:16:59,255 --> 01:17:00,965
Sorry, Temari.

1225
01:17:03,661 --> 01:17:05,705
Thanks to you,
I've come to my senses.

1226
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:07,006
Shikamaru!

1227
01:17:07,152 --> 01:17:09,363
Sorry, but can you take over here?

1228
01:17:09,801 --> 01:17:12,887
I have one more guy
to take down.

1229
01:17:13,421 --> 01:17:15,006
Is that Gengo?!

1230
01:17:15,886 --> 01:17:16,887
How did you know?

1231
01:17:17,175 --> 01:17:19,146
Lord Hokage told me.

1232
01:17:19,171 --> 01:17:21,549
I had a hell of a time trying
to get it out of him.

1233
01:17:21,903 --> 01:17:25,198
I don't want to
even imagine what you did.

1234
01:17:29,981 --> 01:17:32,525
So, Shikamaru, it's okay
to crush these guys?

1235
01:17:32,647 --> 01:17:35,316
They're brainwashed,
but they're comrades.

1236
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:38,357
Please wake them up as well!

1237
01:17:38,382 --> 01:17:39,925
Like, shut up.

1238
01:17:40,085 --> 01:17:40,968
Wait!

1239
01:17:41,799 --> 01:17:44,260
You're forgetting one thing.

1240
01:17:45,256 --> 01:17:48,542
He probably knows you're coming
and has laid traps.

1241
01:17:49,628 --> 01:17:52,173
I hope the odds of your winning
in that condition are good.

1242
01:17:52,266 --> 01:17:54,143
I have no intention of being
a sacrificial pawn.

1243
01:18:05,718 --> 01:18:06,839
All right then!

1244
01:18:12,146 --> 01:18:15,795
Okay, let's get on with our final moves...

1245
01:18:17,151 --> 01:18:18,361
Gengo!

1246
01:18:29,169 --> 01:18:31,546
<i>I won't let you get away... Gengo!</i>

1247
01:18:32,247 --> 01:18:35,567
To think, Shikamaru had this many
reinforcements waiting in the wings.

1248
01:18:36,126 --> 01:18:39,212
As expected of a coward like him.

1249
01:18:39,504 --> 01:18:42,090
I think you're misunderstanding something,
so I'm going to set you right.

1250
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:44,941
We barged in on our own.

1251
01:18:47,345 --> 01:18:49,355
Shikamaru is hiding something.

1252
01:18:50,098 --> 01:18:51,099
Yes.

1253
01:18:51,661 --> 01:18:55,456
It must be serious,
for him to act alone.

1254
01:18:56,228 --> 01:18:57,912
Will you look into it, Temari?

1255
01:18:58,379 --> 01:19:01,299
Use as much manpower as necessary.

1256
01:19:01,634 --> 01:19:02,635
Are you sure?

1257
01:19:03,236 --> 01:19:05,196
Shikamaru is a Leaf shinobi.

1258
01:19:05,655 --> 01:19:08,658
Sand or Leaf... The age of
drawing lines is over.

1259
01:19:09,508 --> 01:19:12,829
A man who is essential to
the Alliance is worth it.

1260
01:19:13,337 --> 01:19:14,547
Besides...

1261
01:19:14,756 --> 01:19:18,259
I doubt the Hokage would
willingly give us intel.

1262
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:19,767
I'll drag it out of him.

1263
01:19:20,342 --> 01:19:23,757
I know you understand,
but do it as peacefully as possible.

1264
01:19:24,129 --> 01:19:26,757
Sure, I'll do it as peacefully...

1265
01:19:27,948 --> 01:19:29,241
as I can.

1266
01:19:31,144 --> 01:19:32,145
And...?

1267
01:19:32,558 --> 01:19:34,518
Is there something else
you needed to ask me?

1268
01:19:35,226 --> 01:19:36,519
Shikamaru is now...

1269
01:19:45,051 --> 01:19:49,199
Anyway, we rushed over after
hearing that Shikamaru was in trouble.

1270
01:19:49,667 --> 01:19:51,179
Out of friendship, right?

1271
01:19:51,868 --> 01:19:52,994
That brings a tear to my eye.

1272
01:19:53,036 --> 01:19:54,245
Well, wait.

1273
01:19:55,146 --> 01:19:57,732
I'll make you cry so hard,
you'll hate it.

1274
01:19:58,360 --> 01:19:59,853
Leave Sai to me.

1275
01:20:00,369 --> 01:20:01,746
He's strong, you know.

1276
01:20:02,087 --> 01:20:03,922
Yeah, I know.

1277
01:20:04,402 --> 01:20:07,984
Sorry, Ino,
but you're no match for me.

1278
01:20:08,587 --> 01:20:10,506
Let me take the old man!

1279
01:20:11,096 --> 01:20:12,097
Oh?

1280
01:20:15,725 --> 01:20:17,143
<i>Wind Scythe Jutsu!</i>

1281
01:20:26,569 --> 01:20:28,947
Wow, that was a surprise.

1282
01:20:29,572 --> 01:20:31,002
But you won't get me
a second time!

1283
01:20:35,286 --> 01:20:38,123
I shall show no mercy,
even if you are just a brat!

1284
01:20:38,303 --> 01:20:39,488
<i>Expansion Jutsu!</i>

1285
01:20:40,083 --> 01:20:41,292
What?!

1286
01:20:44,379 --> 01:20:46,589
Who did you just call a brat?

1287
01:20:51,845 --> 01:20:53,304
Your name is Soku, right?

1288
01:20:53,969 --> 01:20:56,574
You should be supporting Shikamaru.

1289
01:20:57,039 --> 01:20:59,144
So, what the hell are you doing?!

1290
01:20:59,436 --> 01:21:03,590
Like, I simply chose my master
in order to realize my full potential.

1291
01:21:03,898 --> 01:21:05,108
What?

1292
01:21:05,596 --> 01:21:08,319
Like, staying under
a weakling like Shikamaru

1293
01:21:08,883 --> 01:21:11,049
is too tedious and futile!

1294
01:21:13,324 --> 01:21:14,325
Damn!

1295
01:21:15,045 --> 01:21:17,213
Aim more carefully next time.

1296
01:21:17,954 --> 01:21:19,372
If you miss again...

1297
01:21:19,618 --> 01:21:20,798
you'll lose.

1298
01:21:28,572 --> 01:21:34,670
<i>You will definitely
accept my will, Shikamaru.</i>

1299
01:21:36,278 --> 01:21:39,907
Your head's nothing
but a flower garden!

1300
01:21:41,227 --> 01:21:42,729
<i>Resign yourself...</i>

1301
01:21:43,229 --> 01:21:45,106
<i>It's all too late.</i>

1302
01:21:45,476 --> 01:21:46,802
Too late?

1303
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:49,011
What the hell do you mean?!

1304
01:21:51,861 --> 01:21:53,029
Not bad!

1305
01:21:53,715 --> 01:21:56,771
But if you're already out of breath
against one opponent,

1306
01:21:57,494 --> 01:21:58,995
you don't have a chance.

1307
01:21:59,438 --> 01:22:01,690
Sai, wake up!

1308
01:22:02,207 --> 01:22:04,709
Why don't you worry
about yourself instead of me?

1309
01:22:05,085 --> 01:22:07,170
"I don't even know myself anymore..."

1310
01:22:07,466 --> 01:22:11,195
That's what you supposedly wrote
in the last message you sent.

1311
01:22:11,659 --> 01:22:14,933
I have the will that Lord Gengo
bestowed upon me.

1312
01:22:15,658 --> 01:22:18,494
So... I'm not lost anymore!

1313
01:22:26,310 --> 01:22:27,311
Oh...

1314
01:22:27,816 --> 01:22:29,651
Did I overdo it?

1315
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:32,440
His chakra's not reacting...

1316
01:22:36,830 --> 01:22:40,167
No way... Did he die?

1317
01:22:46,842 --> 01:22:53,683
You could say that making my target
misread chakra is my specialty.

1318
01:22:54,093 --> 01:22:58,097
I have no idea what you're saying...

1319
01:22:58,492 --> 01:23:03,891
Shikamaru should be kneeling
before Lord Gengo about now.

1320
01:23:05,692 --> 01:23:08,940
Shikamaru would never...

1321
01:23:09,236 --> 01:23:11,238
What brute strength!

1322
01:23:11,693 --> 01:23:13,779
... bow down to anyone!

1323
01:23:14,986 --> 01:23:16,737
<i>Partial Expansion Jutsu!</i>

1324
01:23:17,198 --> 01:23:18,324
Why you—!

1325
01:23:31,296 --> 01:23:32,297
Take this!

1326
01:23:45,435 --> 01:23:47,228
<i>Cyclone Scythe Jutsu!</i>

1327
01:24:06,653 --> 01:24:08,989
I'll never give up...

1328
01:24:09,361 --> 01:24:11,321
on a precious friend!

1329
01:24:11,836 --> 01:24:17,842
Around now, your precious friend
should be receiving Lord Gengo's will.

1330
01:24:18,474 --> 01:24:21,012
Even as you lay your life on the line.

1331
01:24:21,176 --> 01:24:22,970
You don't understand, do you?

1332
01:24:24,265 --> 01:24:26,267
The precious friend I'm talking about...

1333
01:24:26,868 --> 01:24:28,411
is you!

1334
01:24:29,337 --> 01:24:31,297
<i>You belong to the Hidden Leaf.</i>

1335
01:24:31,322 --> 01:24:32,782
<i>Don't ever forget that!</i>

1336
01:24:33,670 --> 01:24:35,922
Being friends is useless!

1337
01:24:36,659 --> 01:24:37,785
Then...

1338
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:40,978
Then what's that on your cheek?

1339
01:24:43,368 --> 01:24:44,994
<i>Mind Tranfer Jutsu!</i>

1340
01:24:46,895 --> 01:24:49,731
<i>Let me take over your mind
for a little while.</i>

1341
01:25:09,595 --> 01:25:11,614
<i>I didn't lure you in here</i>

1342
01:25:11,639 --> 01:25:14,099
<i>just to prevent you from
using your shadows.</i>

1343
01:25:14,728 --> 01:25:17,043
<i>When a human loses
the ability to see and smell,</i>

1344
01:25:17,068 --> 01:25:19,946
<i>his sense of hearing
becomes much sharper.</i>

1345
01:25:20,329 --> 01:25:23,082
Giving you an even
greater advantage, huh?

1346
01:25:23,658 --> 01:25:29,080
<i>In the shinobi world,
you're either the user or the used.</i>

1347
01:25:29,539 --> 01:25:30,832
What are you talking about?

1348
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:34,675
<i>Words from a shinobi that
I once believed in...</i>

1349
01:25:35,376 --> 01:25:39,632
<i>Surely, even you've heard
the name Zabuza Momochi.</i>

1350
01:25:39,858 --> 01:25:41,234
Zabuza...

1351
01:25:41,259 --> 01:25:44,554
Wasn't he the instigator of
the Mizukage assassination incident?

1352
01:25:45,228 --> 01:25:49,106
<i>After the failed coup d'état,
we deserted the village.</i>

1353
01:25:49,635 --> 01:25:54,982
<i>We had faith in Zabuza's promise to return
some day to create the ideal society.</i>

1354
01:25:55,499 --> 01:25:59,252
<i>But the hardships of wandering
took its toll and changed him.</i>

1355
01:25:59,506 --> 01:26:02,467
<i>And so, I used Zabuza instead.</i>

1356
01:26:03,156 --> 01:26:04,824
<i>Just as he had taught.</i>

1357
01:26:05,401 --> 01:26:07,903
To put it bluntly,
you sold out your friend.

1358
01:26:08,232 --> 01:26:11,526
<i>And I settled here with
my comrades.</i>

1359
01:26:12,248 --> 01:26:15,668
<i>In order to create the ideal society
that Zabuza could not.</i>

1360
01:26:16,957 --> 01:26:20,506
<i>And now, it's finally becoming a reality.</i>

1361
01:26:20,882 --> 01:26:24,135
<i>Don't you want to usher
in that moment with me?</i>

1362
01:26:24,477 --> 01:26:25,686
No thanks!

1363
01:26:25,958 --> 01:26:29,307
The only society I'll sacrifice my
life to protect is the Hidden Leaf!

1364
01:26:29,591 --> 01:26:32,511
The same way that your father
and mentor did?

1365
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:39,135
You have no right to talk about
my dad or Asuma!

1366
01:26:39,473 --> 01:26:43,143
I'll tear down your ideals!

1367
01:26:44,447 --> 01:26:46,449
What has happened... to me?

1368
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:49,827
You are...?

1369
01:26:52,872 --> 01:26:55,124
Like, my head is throbbing...

1370
01:26:56,045 --> 01:26:57,380
That guy's...

1371
01:26:57,501 --> 01:26:59,002
the only one left.

1372
01:27:02,167 --> 01:27:04,461
<i>Sai... answer me!</i>

1373
01:27:05,286 --> 01:27:06,287
<i>Sai!</i>

1374
01:27:07,804 --> 01:27:08,805
<i>Sai!</i>

1375
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:13,267
<i>Who are you?</i>

1376
01:27:14,055 --> 01:27:15,557
<i>I'm your friend.</i>

1377
01:27:16,229 --> 01:27:17,188
<i>No...</i>

1378
01:27:17,587 --> 01:27:20,339
<i>They are my only friends.</i>

1379
01:27:20,394 --> 01:27:23,939
<i>That's just what that guy Gengo
made you believe!</i>

1380
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:26,624
<i>Don't come any closer! Go away!</i>

1381
01:27:43,172 --> 01:27:45,383
<i>Let's go back together, Sai.</i>

1382
01:27:46,764 --> 01:27:49,095
<i>Everyone is waiting for you.</i>

1383
01:27:55,029 --> 01:27:57,365
Sai... Sai!

1384
01:28:00,655 --> 01:28:01,413
Ino?

1385
01:28:01,862 --> 01:28:03,072
You're back!

1386
01:28:04,469 --> 01:28:05,401
Where is Shikamaru?!

1387
01:28:05,932 --> 01:28:08,363
Shikamaru went after that Gengo guy.

1388
01:28:08,796 --> 01:28:09,839
That's not good!

1389
01:28:10,199 --> 01:28:12,243
I have to let Shikamaru
know right away!

1390
01:28:12,743 --> 01:28:14,036
No matter what happens...

1391
01:28:14,203 --> 01:28:15,329
He can't turn around!

1392
01:28:20,835 --> 01:28:23,546
<i>Is the Hidden Leaf
that important to you?</i>

1393
01:28:23,546 --> 01:28:24,964
Damned right it is!

1394
01:28:25,030 --> 01:28:28,033
<i>Then I'll let you in on something good...</i>

1395
01:28:28,955 --> 01:28:34,140
<i>Do you think that I only isolated
myself in this region and did nothing else?</i>

1396
01:28:34,958 --> 01:28:37,293
<i>What would you say</i>

1397
01:28:37,625 --> 01:28:39,970
<i>if I've sent my initiates with
the will I bestowed upon them,</i>

1398
01:28:39,995 --> 01:28:41,998
<i>into all the Hidden Villages?</i>

1399
01:28:42,523 --> 01:28:45,401
The people of the Five Great Nations
aren't blind.

1400
01:28:45,735 --> 01:28:48,404
Your people may have
infiltrated the core,

1401
01:28:48,446 --> 01:28:50,239
but they'll get caught in time.

1402
01:28:50,264 --> 01:28:52,141
<i>I'm talking about the citizens...</i>

1403
01:28:52,366 --> 01:28:56,579
<i>The safety of those
who are most dear to you...</i>

1404
01:28:57,231 --> 01:28:59,108
What did you say?

1405
01:28:59,996 --> 01:29:04,000
<i>One signal from me,
and they will create an incident.</i>

1406
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:07,402
<i>You don't have the means to stop it.</i>

1407
01:29:09,284 --> 01:29:10,462
You're bluffing!

1408
01:29:10,487 --> 01:29:13,157
<i>In time, you'll see if I'm lying or not.</i>

1409
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:16,015
<i>Stop!
Don't you dare touch Mirai!</i>

1410
01:29:16,057 --> 01:29:17,407
<i>Big Brother Shika!</i>

1411
01:29:17,432 --> 01:29:18,141
<i>Mirai!</i>

1412
01:29:18,276 --> 01:29:19,235
<i>Mirai!</i>

1413
01:29:19,466 --> 01:29:22,052
Y-You can't fool me...

1414
01:29:23,112 --> 01:29:27,880
I've already figured out that
you infuse chakra into your voice

1415
01:29:28,394 --> 01:29:29,689
to manipulate people.

1416
01:29:30,310 --> 01:29:35,773
<i>The more you resist with your mind,
the more the heart seeks it.</i>

1417
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:38,957
<i>Big Brother Shika!</i>

1418
01:29:39,132 --> 01:29:40,341
<i>Mirai!</i>

1419
01:29:40,790 --> 01:29:43,626
You'll pay if you lay
a hand on Mirai...

1420
01:29:44,547 --> 01:29:47,509
I'll make sure your breath
is completely snuffed out.

1421
01:29:49,090 --> 01:29:51,676
Kill... Kill...

1422
01:29:51,811 --> 01:29:54,926
– Gengo, you're dangerous.
– Kill... Kill...

1423
01:29:55,510 --> 01:29:57,053
I can't let you go on living.

1424
01:29:58,018 --> 01:29:59,686
This is to protect the Hidden Leaf!

1425
01:29:59,951 --> 01:30:01,410
– It's for that reason that...
– Kill... Kill...

1426
01:30:01,435 --> 01:30:04,730
I've come to carry out
a mission that's not like me!

1427
01:30:05,364 --> 01:30:08,450
– In order to make Naruto the Hokage!
– Kill... Kill...

1428
01:30:22,274 --> 01:30:23,275
<i>Naruto...</i>

1429
01:30:29,807 --> 01:30:30,975
<i>Ramen!</i>

1430
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,559
Huh?

1431
01:30:34,806 --> 01:30:36,391
What the hell was that?

1432
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:38,422
<i>What's the matter, Shikamaru?</i>

1433
01:30:38,836 --> 01:30:42,382
<i>Now, confront the darkness
that consumes your heart!</i>

1434
01:30:51,736 --> 01:30:55,823
<i>I-I have to get it right
the next time.</i>

1435
01:30:56,616 --> 01:31:01,662
Look, you're just a brat,
so it's okay if you ease up a little.

1436
01:31:02,371 --> 01:31:04,582
<i>But it's my fault that my friends...</i>

1437
01:31:05,354 --> 01:31:08,273
Thinking about your friends
is important.

1438
01:31:08,836 --> 01:31:11,756
But you don't have to take on
all that responsibility.

1439
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:13,591
'Cuz it's a drag.

1440
01:31:21,057 --> 01:31:22,183
Why?

1441
01:31:22,975 --> 01:31:24,644
Why doesn't my jutsu work on you?

1442
01:31:25,286 --> 01:31:27,789
Your heart is full of cracks!

1443
01:31:28,310 --> 01:31:31,730
Yeah... My heart is full of cracks...

1444
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:35,153
In fact, it's nothing but one big crack.

1445
01:31:35,799 --> 01:31:36,925
I-Impossible!

1446
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:39,786
Your words don't have
any effect on me anymore.

1447
01:31:41,811 --> 01:31:43,521
I finally understand.

1448
01:31:43,877 --> 01:31:46,838
Earlier, you said you came to
this land with your comrades.

1449
01:31:47,444 --> 01:31:51,615
But why isn't there a single comrade
standing beside you?

1450
01:31:52,612 --> 01:31:57,033
You probably killed them all,
and hid them in this castle, right?

1451
01:31:57,843 --> 01:32:02,431
You're all alone, because you only
believe in using others or being used.

1452
01:32:03,147 --> 01:32:07,276
This place is like peering deep
into your heart!

1453
01:32:07,653 --> 01:32:09,572
You and I are alike!

1454
01:32:10,036 --> 01:32:12,956
We're smart, we can't trust anyone!

1455
01:32:12,981 --> 01:32:14,321
Don't lump me in with you!

1456
01:32:19,245 --> 01:32:20,454
You—!

1457
01:32:21,310 --> 01:32:23,020
Looks like you're still conscious!

1458
01:32:23,364 --> 01:32:26,492
Yeah, but it was touch and
go for a little while.

1459
01:32:27,146 --> 01:32:28,481
Ro, Soku!

1460
01:32:29,786 --> 01:32:30,564
Let's go.

1461
01:32:32,132 --> 01:32:34,677
Okay, let's clean this up quickly!

1462
01:32:36,842 --> 01:32:40,387
Why don't we leave it
to them this time?

1463
01:32:41,011 --> 01:32:42,096
Yeah, you're right...

1464
01:32:42,553 --> 01:32:44,722
Shikamaru did just call
on those two.

1465
01:32:58,070 --> 01:32:59,071
A clone?!

1466
01:33:01,282 --> 01:33:03,075
That's right. With his chakra—!

1467
01:33:07,204 --> 01:33:09,415
Enveloping his shadow
with chakra?!

1468
01:33:09,790 --> 01:33:11,375
Which one is real?

1469
01:33:12,989 --> 01:33:15,408
I can't... move!

1470
01:33:16,255 --> 01:33:20,092
If you stop me,
the world of the shinobi will decline!

1471
01:33:20,593 --> 01:33:25,197
Don't you care if you're consigned to a
life of servitude under the Feudal Lords?

1472
01:33:25,422 --> 01:33:29,676
A place where even the easygoing
can live in their own way...

1473
01:33:29,894 --> 01:33:32,730
That's the kind of world
I want to protect!

1474
01:33:32,813 --> 01:33:34,190
How stupid!

1475
01:33:34,361 --> 01:33:39,742
I will not let you interfere
with my vision!

1476
01:33:44,575 --> 01:33:47,286
Like, the chakra flowing to
your tongue's been cut off...

1477
01:33:52,166 --> 01:33:54,627
Mission... complete!

1478
01:33:57,336 --> 01:33:58,504
Good work.

1479
01:33:59,003 --> 01:34:01,131
We'll be taking Gengo
and his revolutionaries

1480
01:34:01,156 --> 01:34:02,574
back to the Hidden Leaf Village now.

1481
01:34:03,287 --> 01:34:04,580
Will you be joining us?

1482
01:34:05,728 --> 01:34:07,201
We...

1483
01:34:11,292 --> 01:34:13,711
You came to the rescue again.

1484
01:34:14,426 --> 01:34:15,510
Sheesh...

1485
01:34:15,999 --> 01:34:19,336
You really are something, Naruto.

1486
01:34:22,919 --> 01:34:23,920
You guys!

1487
01:34:24,538 --> 01:34:26,582
What? Did you forget something?

1488
01:34:27,953 --> 01:34:31,398
Like, we were told we're on a
mission until we get back to the village.

1489
01:34:31,443 --> 01:34:34,320
We shall accompany you, Shikamaru.

1490
01:34:34,376 --> 01:34:37,337
Huh? Oh, yeah?

1491
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:39,401
Senpai!

1492
01:34:40,193 --> 01:34:41,194
Yurito?!

1493
01:34:42,716 --> 01:34:44,552
You came too?

1494
01:34:44,677 --> 01:34:48,806
I finally got to handle
a big assignment!

1495
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:50,382
O-Oh...

1496
01:34:50,683 --> 01:34:55,354
Huh? Senpai, aren't you being
too stiff and formal again?

1497
01:34:55,493 --> 01:34:58,329
Clouds! The clouds!
Remember, the clouds!

1498
01:34:58,918 --> 01:35:00,295
Oh, yeah...

1499
01:35:00,755 --> 01:35:04,258
Anyway, I'm busy, so 'scuse me!

1500
01:35:07,511 --> 01:35:08,929
Shikamaru?

1501
01:35:09,727 --> 01:35:13,609
You can reach out to try and grab
the cloud but you can never grasp it.

1502
01:35:14,013 --> 01:35:16,098
If there's wind, it'll blow away.

1503
01:35:16,412 --> 01:35:19,164
Such a strange thing with no core.

1504
01:35:21,815 --> 01:35:22,816
Temari...

1505
01:35:22,982 --> 01:35:24,401
Huh? What is it?

1506
01:35:24,733 --> 01:35:28,487
Well... It's nothing important, but...

1507
01:35:29,231 --> 01:35:30,232
Um...

1508
01:35:30,257 --> 01:35:31,299
What is it?

1509
01:35:31,324 --> 01:35:32,492
Spit it out.

1510
01:35:33,332 --> 01:35:37,086
Go a bit easier
when you slap people, will you?

1511
01:35:37,436 --> 01:35:40,856
If you space out again,
I'll slap you as much as I want to!

1512
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:43,782
Okay... I'm counting on you for that.

1513
01:35:45,894 --> 01:35:48,397
Thanks... for what you did this time.

1514
01:35:49,823 --> 01:35:52,408
Is this an awkward conversation
or what?!

1515
01:35:52,786 --> 01:35:55,270
Just hurry and ask her out!

1516
01:35:55,295 --> 01:35:56,538
There, there...

1517
01:35:57,023 --> 01:35:57,982
Ino...

1518
01:35:58,616 --> 01:35:59,490
Sai?

1519
01:35:59,861 --> 01:36:01,487
Thanks, beautiful.

1520
01:36:02,460 --> 01:36:05,129
I really felt... your kindness.

1521
01:36:05,542 --> 01:36:08,029
Beautiful? Oh... uh!

1522
01:36:08,385 --> 01:36:10,054
I want to thank you...

1523
01:36:10,558 --> 01:36:12,018
That's if you'd let me.

1524
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:15,476
Oh... Well then...

1525
01:36:15,726 --> 01:36:18,604
Maybe a d-date...?

1526
01:36:19,060 --> 01:36:21,813
Ino, now you're being awkward.

1527
01:36:22,513 --> 01:36:25,266
Maybe... next time... we can...

1528
01:36:26,292 --> 01:36:28,211
go get a bite to eat.

1529
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:29,301
You mean, a date?

1530
01:36:29,326 --> 01:36:30,119
Huh?

1531
01:36:30,284 --> 01:36:32,453
Are you asking me out on a date?

1532
01:36:33,204 --> 01:36:34,914
Well, yeah.

1533
01:36:37,298 --> 01:36:39,342
I see. A date, huh.

1534
01:36:40,376 --> 01:36:41,543
You don't want to?

1535
01:36:42,174 --> 01:36:43,509
That's not it.

1536
01:36:43,796 --> 01:36:45,506
Huh? Uh?

1537
01:36:46,013 --> 01:36:47,222
Be prepared.

1538
01:36:47,716 --> 01:36:50,469
A date with me
can be quite a drag.

1539
01:36:54,251 --> 01:36:56,170
Do you have a plan?

1540
01:36:56,809 --> 01:36:57,793
Huh?

1541
01:36:57,818 --> 01:36:59,486
Like, a date strategy.

1542
01:36:59,659 --> 01:37:01,202
Like I'd have one!

1543
01:37:01,546 --> 01:37:03,631
Going on a first date
without a strategy

1544
01:37:03,816 --> 01:37:06,610
is like fighting
a Tailed Beast unarmed.

1545
01:37:07,523 --> 01:37:09,817
You have zero chance of winning.

1546
01:37:10,169 --> 01:37:12,380
What would you two know?!

1547
01:37:12,444 --> 01:37:13,904
What are you saying?!

1548
01:37:13,929 --> 01:37:17,558
I do know a thing or two
about relationships.

1549
01:37:17,955 --> 01:37:21,483
You must first find out everything you
can about Lady Temari's likes and dislikes...

1550
01:37:21,508 --> 01:37:23,719
and come up with a careful plan.

1551
01:37:24,011 --> 01:37:25,805
And you need at least
three contingency plans:

1552
01:37:25,830 --> 01:37:28,374
one for a sunny day,
a cloudy day and a rainy day!

1553
01:37:28,590 --> 01:37:31,176
Prepare small talk
that won't bore her.

1554
01:37:31,301 --> 01:37:35,556
Have at least a hundred stories
in your arsenal.

1555
01:37:35,764 --> 01:37:37,182
Hey, hey!

1556
01:37:37,299 --> 01:37:41,595
That's even more of a drag
than taking Gengo down!
