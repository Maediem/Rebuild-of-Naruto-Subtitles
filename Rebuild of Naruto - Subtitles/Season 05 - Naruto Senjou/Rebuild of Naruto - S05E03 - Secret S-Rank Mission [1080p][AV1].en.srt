1
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:14,014
By the way, Kakashi-sensei,
who's that on your back?

2
00:00:15,802 --> 00:00:17,262
She's one of Sasuke's comrades.

3
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,707
Not anymore.

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,334
I have a lot of questions
I want to ask her,

5
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:25,734
so I'm taking her
back to the village.

6
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:28,887
I see. So we're going back
to Hidden Leaf Village.

7
00:00:29,508 --> 00:00:31,301
Naruto, not that way.

8
00:00:31,828 --> 00:00:34,080
What are you saying, Kakashi-sensei?

9
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,661
Hidden Leaf Village is this way.

10
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,997
We forgot something in the Land of Iron.

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,791
Right, Sakura?

12
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:42,500
Forgot something...

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,127
Oh!

14
00:00:44,302 --> 00:00:46,137
We should go back
and retrieve it, right?

15
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:47,282
Yes.

16
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,966
Hmm? What is it?

17
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:55,764
We're home!

18
00:00:56,174 --> 00:00:57,842
– Lord Bee!
– Lord Bee!

19
00:00:58,257 --> 00:01:01,052
Yo! Long time no see,
Omoi, Karui!

20
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:04,482
Have ya been getting by cheerfully,
care-free-ly? Merrily?

21
00:01:04,658 --> 00:01:06,255
Of course not!

22
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:08,448
Not after you suddenly disappeared
from the village like that.

23
00:01:08,473 --> 00:01:10,058
Do you know
how worried we were?!

24
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:13,531
Now, now! He was safe all this time,
so it's all okay now!

25
00:01:14,203 --> 00:01:17,415
Lord Raikage, welcome home.

26
00:01:18,947 --> 00:01:20,949
I know it's sudden, but we wish
to hold a council right away

27
00:01:20,974 --> 00:01:23,351
regarding what transpired at
the Five Kage Summit.

28
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,543
What? No downtime?

29
00:01:25,568 --> 00:01:27,445
We can't afford to take it easy.

30
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,006
Things are about to
get even hotter.

31
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:31,674
Why is that?

32
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:34,543
The Fourth Great Ninja War.

33
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:35,720
Huh?

34
00:01:35,848 --> 00:01:37,766
An Allied Shinobi Force
has been formed.

35
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,518
Tell them the details
at the meeting.

36
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:47,732
Also, we'll need to meet
with the Feudal Lord.

37
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:50,069
I have requested
an audience with him.

38
00:01:50,594 --> 00:01:51,595
Huh?

39
00:01:52,306 --> 00:01:53,891
What's that?

40
00:01:54,091 --> 00:01:57,719
Just a spoil of war from my battle against
one of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen.

41
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:02,664
It's taken a liking to me.
It won't leave my side.

42
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,735
Wow, so this is one of the Seven Ninja
Swordsmen's blades, huh?

43
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,971
Unbelievable!
As expected of you Lord Bee!

44
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,255
As expected...?

45
00:02:10,376 --> 00:02:13,338
Even the great Me...
just has to let it be.

46
00:02:29,977 --> 00:02:32,938
Well? Did you record the battle?

47
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:35,742
<i>Yeah.</i>

48
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,198
What about Samehada?

49
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,450
<i>The Eight-Tails took it.</i>

50
00:02:39,771 --> 00:02:41,773
I see. Then...

51
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,037
<i>Yeah.</i>

52
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,789
<i>It went perfectly.</i>

53
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,458
<i>You've got to hand it to Kisame.</i>

54
00:02:49,256 --> 00:02:51,133
I will declare the start of

55
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:54,299
the Fourth Great Ninja War
at the Five Kage Summit.

56
00:02:54,553 --> 00:02:56,805
So the time is now ripe.

57
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,637
Once I've declared war,

58
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:03,641
I suspect the Eight-Tails' movements
will be restricted and he'll be confined.

59
00:03:04,311 --> 00:03:07,314
Then you can hunt him
at your own leisure.

60
00:03:07,779 --> 00:03:12,033
I'm ready anytime, but...

61
00:03:12,411 --> 00:03:13,912
First, we infiltrate.

62
00:03:14,283 --> 00:03:17,787
We sneak into their midst
and obtain intel.

63
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,492
So this is an infiltration mission?

64
00:03:21,517 --> 00:03:22,851
Use White Zetsu.

65
00:03:23,074 --> 00:03:28,496
Once he makes contact, he can copy
a person's chakra and create a clone.

66
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:30,753
Leave it to me.

67
00:03:30,923 --> 00:03:32,216
However, he's weak.

68
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:36,549
You can't use him in battle,
but he's good for deception.

69
00:03:36,622 --> 00:03:39,625
If fighting the Eight-Tails
gets too exciting,

70
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:44,265
I might end up almost killing him,
but I accept!

71
00:03:44,574 --> 00:03:45,575
All right.

72
00:03:45,604 --> 00:03:47,731
I'll leave the Eight-Tails
in your hands.

73
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,520
Leave it to me.

74
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,651
<i>Now then, this is where things
start getting tough.</i>

75
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,988
<i>It was good to let Samehada take
a liking to the Eight-Tails.</i>

76
00:03:59,235 --> 00:04:03,239
<i>I never imagined it would even
share chakra with him.</i>

77
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,704
<i>Though that ended up
working in my favor.</i>

78
00:04:07,756 --> 00:04:11,010
<i>Their sensory-type ninja
hasn't caught on yet.</i>

79
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,543
<i>It's not surprising.</i>

80
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:17,270
<i>Since Samehada takes in
Kisame's chakra and uses it for energy,</i>

81
00:04:17,295 --> 00:04:19,464
<i>they have the same
chakra signature.</i>

82
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:22,796
<i>The enemy doesn't
know any better.</i>

83
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:26,140
I could take on
the infiltration mission.

84
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,142
<i>You are weak.</i>

85
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,354
<i>Ultimately, we are going to
capture the Eight-Tails.</i>

86
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,434
<i>Kisame is the suitable one.</i>

87
00:04:34,745 --> 00:04:37,498
<i>But you pulled off
that performance quite well.</i>

88
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,989
It wasn't easy switching places
with Kisame underwater.

89
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,432
I'm not used to it.

90
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,501
<i>Don't you think you're overdoing it?</i>

91
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:58,631
<i>It was just right for the Eight-Tails.</i>

92
00:04:58,768 --> 00:05:02,021
<i>I guess it's my turn now.</i>

93
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,531
<i>I leave it in your hands.</i>

94
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,147
<i>Water Style:
Super Shark Bomb</i>—

95
00:05:16,032 --> 00:05:18,243
– <i>Double Lariat!</i>
– <i>Double Lariat!</i>

96
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:26,409
I can undo my Body Substitution
Jutsu now, right?

97
00:05:26,581 --> 00:05:27,624
<i>Yeah.</i>

98
00:05:31,784 --> 00:05:36,288
<i>It's almost feeding time.
Let's merge.</i>

99
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:48,864
Where'd he go?

100
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:04,065
I'm adapting to the power.

101
00:06:06,931 --> 00:06:09,017
It feels good. This isn't bad.

102
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:13,456
I think I'll stir things up a little.

103
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,217
<i>The Akatsuki possess
the Tailed Beasts.</i>

104
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,887
<i>We cannot go on and do nothing.</i>

105
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:54,932
<i>Besides, they are led by
that Madara Uchiha.</i>

106
00:07:55,737 --> 00:07:58,156
<i>We must do everything we can now.</i>

107
00:07:58,868 --> 00:08:00,369
<i>I know that.</i>

108
00:08:00,872 --> 00:08:02,999
<i>Then hurry up and
give your approval.</i>

109
00:08:03,098 --> 00:08:06,101
<i>Are you willing to lose this war?</i>

110
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,572
<i>But the Allied Shinobi Force...</i>

111
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,660
<i>What if we give them
too much power</i>

112
00:08:12,685 --> 00:08:14,521
<i>and this decision comes back
to haunt us later?</i>

113
00:08:15,316 --> 00:08:18,611
<i>Do you really distrust
your own nation's shinobi that much?</i>

114
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,249
<i>First...</i>

115
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:24,462
We will need you to come
to a decision soon.

116
00:08:24,648 --> 00:08:28,694
The battery is running low.
It is such a long distance.

117
00:08:31,414 --> 00:08:33,625
<i>Let's conclude this.</i>

118
00:08:33,986 --> 00:08:35,946
<i>Lightning approves this.</i>

119
00:08:36,626 --> 00:08:38,920
<i>Earth agrees with Lightning.</i>

120
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,854
<i>Wind approves this as well.</i>

121
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:44,281
<i>Why not?</i>

122
00:08:45,164 --> 00:08:46,666
<i>Fire approves it.</i>

123
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,156
<i>All right.
Water approves it as well.</i>

124
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,675
So now, with this...

125
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,870
The formation of
the Allied Shinobi Force is ratified.

126
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,891
Let the record show.
I, Tenga, shall serve as the witness.

127
00:09:06,111 --> 00:09:09,656
Thank you all very much.
This ends the transmission.

128
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:13,120
It is finally over.

129
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:17,890
Now it would be good to contact
the Hidden Leaf at once.

130
00:09:20,235 --> 00:09:22,112
Is this is what you forgot?

131
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:25,164
How could these guys
just lay around sleeping

132
00:09:25,433 --> 00:09:28,394
while you were in
such a bind, Sakura?

133
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:30,903
Sakura!

134
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,447
They were going to help you.

135
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:37,034
Apologize properly after
you wake them up.

136
00:09:37,513 --> 00:09:38,180
I will.

137
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,495
You're going to wake them up?

138
00:09:43,061 --> 00:09:44,062
Damn it.

139
00:09:44,141 --> 00:09:45,098
Naruto...

140
00:09:45,123 --> 00:09:47,459
It's my fault that they're asleep.

141
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,506
So be gentle when you wake them.

142
00:09:50,788 --> 00:09:52,456
I feel sick.

143
00:09:52,481 --> 00:09:53,857
You're going to sleep too?

144
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:58,306
Naruto's like that because of you...
umm, Sakura, right?

145
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,224
It's because of your poison.

146
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,605
What a carefree guy.
He's already asleep.

147
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,524
<i>He's sleeping so soundly.</i>

148
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,902
<i>I think a burden's been
lifted off of him.</i>

149
00:10:13,481 --> 00:10:16,157
However, we don't
have time to waste.

150
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,993
Sakura, wake them up.

151
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,462
Lord Kazekage has returned.

152
00:10:25,642 --> 00:10:27,602
Did you receive
Tobimaru's message?

153
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:28,919
Yes, ma'am!

154
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,151
Any word from the Feudal Lords?

155
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,882
Yes, just a while ago.

156
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,718
Welcome home, Lady Mizukage.

157
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,845
We received word from
the Feudal Lord.

158
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,389
Let's hear it, go ahead!

159
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,768
Well, that was quick.

160
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:49,273
Those lords worked quickly because the
Tailed Beasts and Madara were mentioned.

161
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:52,861
Damn it, this is ridiculous!

162
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:58,749
We listened to her wishes and
even located Sasuke for her.

163
00:10:58,834 --> 00:11:01,169
Now don't be so upset, Kiba.

164
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,705
Don't act like you're
the only hero here, Sakura.

165
00:11:05,306 --> 00:11:08,434
You told us to keep this
a secret from Naruto,

166
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:13,172
but Sai went and blabbed it all to him,
on top of which, Sasuke got away.

167
00:11:13,468 --> 00:11:14,469
Kiba!

168
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,802
Be a man and quit complaining.

169
00:11:18,321 --> 00:11:20,990
Speak for yourself, Naruto!

170
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:22,141
Huh? Me?

171
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,043
Oh, you're right about that!

172
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,352
You are too simple and dumb

173
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,688
to be able to think as complexly
as you've been trying to.

174
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:29,814
Hey Sai!

175
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:33,025
Since when did you develop
such a carefree laugh? Huh?

176
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,193
Thank you.

177
00:11:34,398 --> 00:11:35,650
That wasn't a compliment!

178
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,823
What is it, Bushy Brow?

179
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,826
It's like you're back
to your old self, Naruto.

180
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,994
He means you
haven't grown at all.

181
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:45,688
Once an idiot, always an idiot.

182
00:11:45,713 --> 00:11:48,507
Kiba, you're the idiot!
Idiot!

183
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,793
I don't want to hear that
coming from an idiot!

184
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,170
I've had enough of
your smiling face!

185
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:57,633
<i>This guy is the complete
opposite of Sasuke.</i>

186
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:06,767
<i>His chakra is... so...
bright and warm.</i>

187
00:12:11,638 --> 00:12:12,758
<i>What is this?</i>

188
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:16,402
<i>Deep inside him...
A chakra like this? So dark!</i>

189
00:12:16,905 --> 00:12:18,490
<i>As though...</i>

190
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,785
Sai, you need to explain
everything that's happened.

191
00:12:25,008 --> 00:12:26,509
Who are these guys?

192
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,873
Members of the Foundation,
from the Anbu Black Ops.

193
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,250
It seems you are aware of it too.

194
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:35,212
The reason why the Curse Mark
placed on us by Lord Danzo is gone.

195
00:12:36,105 --> 00:12:38,766
Is Lord Danzo... dead?

196
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:39,858
Yes.

197
00:12:39,983 --> 00:12:40,984
That's...

198
00:12:41,246 --> 00:12:42,998
What about his bodyguards,
Foo and Torune?

199
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,765
I'm in the dark about them too.

200
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:48,350
They were not at the site.

201
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:53,063
Therefore, I would like to
propose a discussion

202
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,816
about the future of
the Foundation with you.

203
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,235
And with the new Hokage here...

204
00:12:58,582 --> 00:13:00,000
New Hokage?

205
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,031
Kakashi Hatake.

206
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:02,796
Huh?!

207
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,745
We'll head back ahead of you.

208
00:13:11,573 --> 00:13:14,326
You're going to be the next Hokage,
Kakashi-sensei?

209
00:13:17,184 --> 00:13:20,104
Looks like it's going to be that way.

210
00:13:22,327 --> 00:13:24,579
It's certain, the Akatsuki
is definitely strong.

211
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:26,606
Their war potential is unknown.

212
00:13:27,814 --> 00:13:30,483
But the true strength of
our Allied Shinobi Forces,

213
00:13:30,508 --> 00:13:33,720
which is unparalleled in history,
is also unknown.

214
00:13:34,295 --> 00:13:37,882
Earth, Water, Fire, Wind,
and Lightning...

215
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:41,229
If we unite all the shinobi's power,

216
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:44,173
I believe we can
counter them thoroughly.

217
00:13:45,265 --> 00:13:48,560
Above all, we must win this battle
or the world will end.

218
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:58,212
Begin stockpiling ninja tools
and rations immediately.

219
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:02,390
All official missions will be temporarily
halted in preparation for battle.

220
00:14:02,415 --> 00:14:05,694
Give me a list of all shinobi
belonging to the village.

221
00:14:05,736 --> 00:14:06,946
At the same time,

222
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,807
I want each squad to begin
preparing their tactical plans.

223
00:14:10,478 --> 00:14:14,398
No way! Sasuke attacked
the Five Kage Summit?!

224
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,481
I hear they're about to announce it.

225
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,776
Seems there is utter confusion
among the officials.

226
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,822
So it's true that Sasuke is
a member of the Akatsuki,

227
00:14:24,847 --> 00:14:26,807
who crushed the Hidden Leaf.

228
00:14:28,196 --> 00:14:30,741
Looks like this is going to
turn out to be a drag.

229
00:14:35,148 --> 00:14:36,775
These are orders
from Lady Mizukage.

230
00:14:36,805 --> 00:14:39,140
Confirm our supplies of
ninja tools immediately!

231
00:14:39,368 --> 00:14:41,078
Make a list of anything
we're short on!

232
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,010
I don't know about
this Allied Shinobi Forces,

233
00:14:46,206 --> 00:14:48,459
but I won't join up with
those guys from the Stone.

234
00:14:49,684 --> 00:14:51,949
The Akatsuki is a hateful group
that brought

235
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,685
the nightmare of
the Fourth Mizukage upon this nation.

236
00:14:55,502 --> 00:14:59,990
The Hidden Stone has used the
Akatsuki time and again in the past.

237
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,610
The higher-ups may order it,

238
00:15:02,725 --> 00:15:05,186
but there's no way Ganryu
would accept it.

239
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,490
You're being very careful with them.

240
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:12,536
They are the great masterpieces
of a legendary puppeteer.

241
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,997
I cannot allow myself
to be bested

242
00:15:15,022 --> 00:15:16,899
by the generations of
puppeteers before me.

243
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,251
What about you?

244
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:23,955
I just sent off messages to those
ninja currently on far away missions.

245
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,722
But to think it has come to
killing a Hokage.

246
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,678
You mean Sasuke Uchiha?

247
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,307
I knew it, but he's really fallen
as low as you can get.

248
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:36,936
But...

249
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:44,234
<i>If you are prepared to bear
the burden of being a Kage,</i>

250
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,179
<i>then do what is right
as Sasuke's friend.</i>

251
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,390
He didn't seem to
be convinced, did he?

252
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,293
It's because he never gives up.

253
00:16:01,857 --> 00:16:03,984
He's the one who changed
the old Gaara,

254
00:16:04,373 --> 00:16:06,432
the one we could never approach.

255
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:10,427
No matter how lost in
the darkness a person might be,

256
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,429
he will hold out his hand.

257
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,307
He will try to save him.

258
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,183
That's how he is.

259
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,268
Gaara...

260
00:16:18,741 --> 00:16:21,452
But it's Sasuke himself
who's seeking the darkness.

261
00:16:21,911 --> 00:16:22,996
This time, I don't think...

262
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,567
It has to be Naruto's decision
after that.

263
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,195
What he will do as a friend.

264
00:16:29,952 --> 00:16:34,140
I will simply give my all to
protect my friends...

265
00:16:35,522 --> 00:16:37,162
and the world!

266
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,092
Sakura...

267
00:16:52,146 --> 00:16:53,355
I'm back.

268
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,849
I heard from my dad...
about Sasuke.

269
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:58,226
Yeah...

270
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:02,929
And I fought with him.

271
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,943
"Fought"? You mean with Sasuke?!

272
00:17:09,323 --> 00:17:10,738
I'll give you the details later.

273
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,824
Sorry, but would you mind getting
everybody together?

274
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,619
There's something I want to say.

275
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,373
Okay.

276
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,934
She originally worked
for Orochimaru

277
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:44,963
before she joined up with Sasuke
as a shinobi for the Akatsuki.

278
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,169
That means she knows a lot.

279
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,572
You better treat me well.

280
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:54,907
And...

281
00:17:54,932 --> 00:17:58,269
It looks like she was there when
Sasuke and Danzo battled it out.

282
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,205
You saw them fighting?

283
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,416
You're interrogating me here?

284
00:18:04,718 --> 00:18:07,637
Okay, we'll hold her at
the Intel Division.

285
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,713
We'll get everything she knows.

286
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:11,715
Take her away.

287
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:12,758
Yes, sir.

288
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:18,013
Hey... no! I won't try to escape.

289
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,017
So let go of me, will you?!

290
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,269
Geez!

291
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,773
I'm so thirsty,
give me something to drink!

292
00:18:29,565 --> 00:18:31,909
By the way,
how's Lady Tsunade doing?

293
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,780
She's still unconscious.

294
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,573
I see.

295
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,202
Well, I'll go make my report
to the superiors.

296
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,245
Excuse me.

297
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:43,914
Kakashi...

298
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:48,148
The chain of command in the
Hidden Leaf Village is in shambles.

299
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,755
Someone has to restore order
as soon as possible.

300
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,717
Yeah... I know that.

301
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,765
Sasuke did that?

302
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,602
It's an unbelievable situation.

303
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:09,368
That's why I want you to
let me handle Sasuke.

304
00:19:10,457 --> 00:19:12,167
You'll take on Sasuke alone?!

305
00:19:12,505 --> 00:19:15,967
How can you expect us
to agree to that?

306
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:18,784
Tenten is right, Naruto.

307
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,952
We can't just give in to
your stubbornness.

308
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,497
The reason is that this is a 
major problem for the village.

309
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,833
I'm not being stubborn.

310
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,428
You said you'd give us
the details when we got home,

311
00:19:31,453 --> 00:19:33,163
but I never thought
this is what you'd say!

312
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:37,384
We've all made up our minds
to kill Sasuke!

313
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,941
Hey Naruto, don't tell me
you're saying

314
00:19:40,966 --> 00:19:42,926
you'll get Sasuke all by yourself,

315
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,225
when you're actually planning
to protect him.

316
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:49,897
No, I have no intention
of protecting Sasuke.

317
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,779
– <i>Chidori!</i>
– <i>Rasengan!</i>

318
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:05,929
After all that fighting at the Five
Kage Summit, and fighting Danzo...

319
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,123
If Sasuke was weakened
at that time,

320
00:20:08,431 --> 00:20:10,254
why didn't you take
him out right then?

321
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,294
Madara was there too!

322
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,588
It didn't seem so easy.

323
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:15,800
Besides...

324
00:20:15,825 --> 00:20:19,287
That's no reason to let him
get away so easily!

325
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,220
Hey Naruto...

326
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,679
You're strong.

327
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,599
You're the hero who
took down Pain, aren't you?!

328
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,309
Hero?

329
00:20:27,334 --> 00:20:30,629
Yeah. You could take Sasuke down
like you did back then.

330
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,105
That's not true.

331
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,649
Huh?

332
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,403
I wouldn't be able to beat Sasuke
with something like that now.

333
00:20:39,047 --> 00:20:40,298
That's what I found out.

334
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,410
<i>Inside him...</i>

335
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:52,000
What is it that you found out?

336
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:56,171
In any case, nobody should take
on Sasuke as he is now.

337
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,090
What do you mean?

338
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,884
I'm the only one who can fight him.

339
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,719
That's what I mean.

340
00:21:02,968 --> 00:21:05,220
That doesn't tell us anything!

341
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,725
Explain it in detail.
What happened?

342
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,395
I said I'd tell you when
the time comes.

343
00:21:11,423 --> 00:21:15,093
Hey! There you go again!
Giving us the runaround!

344
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,566
Damn it.

345
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,069
<i>Naruto...</i>

346
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,864
<i>Sasuke...</i>

347
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:30,289
<i>Were you able to read...</i>

348
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:33,834
<i>what was inside my heart?</i>

349
00:21:35,581 --> 00:21:37,792
<i>And you saw it, didn't you?</i>

350
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,966
<i>That if you and I fight...</i>

351
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,510
<i>we will both die.</i>

352
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,639
<i>What are you hiding?</i>

353
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,094
Well...

354
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:52,842
Please leave it to me.

355
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,272
Hey! Naruto!

356
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:56,608
Naruto...

357
00:21:57,223 --> 00:21:58,224
Hey, Naruto!

358
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,950
Danzo too?

359
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:11,330
Such a shame.
The best ones go first.

360
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:13,375
We must quickly hold a meeting

361
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,460
to determine who will
be the next Hokage.

362
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,796
The Allied Shinobi Force
will be stalled

363
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,256
if the Hokage is missing.

364
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,050
That cannot be helped.

365
00:22:23,274 --> 00:22:25,777
We will recommend you for Hokage.

366
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,138
The Sand,
a member of the alliance,

367
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,598
has also recommended you.

368
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,224
I am prepared for it.

369
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,769
Somebody! Somebody,
come quickly! Please!

370
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:35,979
What's happened?

371
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:44,905
Shizune... Don't tell me...

372
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,418
Thanks for accepting.

373
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:03,924
I would feel a lot better if you
would become the Hokage, Shikaku.

374
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:05,509
Don't be ridiculous.

375
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:08,762
I'm old enough to retire and
have my son take over.

376
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,848
Of course,
I'm in no position to do that.

377
00:23:12,275 --> 00:23:13,276
Yes.

378
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:18,897
To think that Danzo fell
to the Akatsuki.

379
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,399
Yes.

380
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,276
We must decide on another Hokage.

381
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:27,239
We are all recommending
Kakashi Hatake.

382
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,117
Oh, that man?

383
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,869
Kakashi Hatake, enter.

384
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:48,009
All right. Kakashi Hatake!
You will be...

385
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,554
Please excuse me!

386
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:52,305
Guy?

387
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:55,809
What is this?!
We are in an important conference.

388
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:59,062
I have come to report a sudden change
in the state of affairs!

389
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,481
What? A sudden change?!

390
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,361
Lady Tsunade!

391
00:24:09,403 --> 00:24:11,405
Shizune... you're hurting me.

392
00:24:12,266 --> 00:24:14,352
Send messages to
the other villages!

393
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,622
Tsunade, the Hokage of Hidden
Leaf Village, is alive and well!

394
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:21,001
Report this to the Feudal Lords
of the other lands as well.

395
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:24,129
We should let the people of
our village know at once.

396
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,339
I will leave that to you.

397
00:24:27,121 --> 00:24:28,459
Umm... Well...

398
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,804
May I go home?

399
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,558
Since we're here now,

400
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:38,710
why don't we go and eat at
that sushi boat restaurant?

401
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,604
Let's see who can eat the most!

402
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,903
You must rest for a while.

403
00:24:48,627 --> 00:24:52,005
It takes some time to become
accustomed to the Mangekyo.

404
00:24:52,795 --> 00:24:54,005
Are you in pain?

405
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,368
No.

406
00:24:56,286 --> 00:25:00,749
It feels right. I can feel
Itachi's visual powers.

407
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:04,669
I can feel myself getting stronger!

408
00:25:15,209 --> 00:25:17,086
Please eat more slowly!

409
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:18,892
This is not enough!

410
00:25:19,133 --> 00:25:21,009
My chakra hasn't returned
to normal!

411
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,732
Bring me more food!

412
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:28,112
If I'm not careful,
I'll become an old hag!

413
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,571
Uh-oh, no, no!

414
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:36,576
The Hokage Quarters' supply stores
have run out.

415
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,412
I'll go and requisition
more provisions,

416
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:42,374
so please take a short break.

417
00:25:50,346 --> 00:25:53,527
No! Don't do it!
What are you thinking?!

418
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,178
This one is completely off limits!

419
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,639
What are you talking about?

420
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:58,848
Huh?

421
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,018
K-Kakashi...

422
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,981
I'm glad to see you so well.

423
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:09,150
This is nothing,
I'm just getting started.

424
00:26:09,413 --> 00:26:12,279
After all you've eaten,
it doesn't make any sense.

425
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,322
I am relieved.

426
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,659
I was dangerously close
to becoming the Hokage.

427
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:21,496
But well, I'm not really
the Hokage type.

428
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,873
Considering the present situation,
we need someone like you,

429
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:26,334
Lady Tsunade, with wide influence,
to be the Hokage.

430
00:26:28,037 --> 00:26:30,664
I must say I am amazed to hear
about the Allied Shinobi Force.

431
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:34,714
And I'm surprised that the Tsuchikage
and the Raikage agreed to cooperate.

432
00:26:35,615 --> 00:26:39,060
That just goes to prove what an
awful situation we are faced with.

433
00:26:40,816 --> 00:26:42,193
Madara Uchiha...

434
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,103
He's really still alive?

435
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,189
We don't have absolute proof,

436
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,525
but considering what
they are trying to do,

437
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,193
I'd say there's no doubt about it.

438
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:54,747
Another war, huh?

439
00:26:55,797 --> 00:26:57,507
Who would have thought
the karma of the Uchiha

440
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:59,451
would engulf all the shinobi
in the world.

441
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:07,208
I will call a meeting immediately
after this meal!

442
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,210
We must prepare for war!

443
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,497
Before he died,
Jiraiya said to me,

444
00:27:16,522 --> 00:27:19,566
"go store yourself inside Naruto."

445
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,474
Great Lord Elder!

446
00:27:22,499 --> 00:27:25,461
Are you sure this is the right thing?

447
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:31,399
Jiraiya claimed that Naruto
could completely control

448
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:33,568
the power of the Nine-Tails,

449
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:36,363
but when we tested him,
it didn't go well.

450
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,741
But Jiraiya refused to give in,

451
00:27:38,766 --> 00:27:41,436
saying that it was for that purpose
that Minato had sealed

452
00:27:41,461 --> 00:27:43,838
half of the Nine-Tails' chakra
inside of Naruto.

453
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:53,797
Great Lord Elder, Gerotora himself
is the key to Naruto's Tetragram Seal.

454
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,841
Is it safe to hand him over to Naruto?

455
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:58,968
What do you think?

456
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:03,306
Have Naruto Uzumaki come here.

457
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,976
I shall do a reading on him.

458
00:28:07,717 --> 00:28:09,636
We will then see what
we must do.

459
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,068
Is everyone here?

460
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:19,614
We shall now start our war council
to discuss strategy!

461
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:23,618
First, assemble reserves of
ninja tools and foodstuffs.

462
00:28:24,199 --> 00:28:27,727
We must divide our shinobi into
main battle units and support forces,

463
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:30,016
and consider how we should
build the squads

464
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,167
within the fighting forces!

465
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,713
Bring me the complete list
of all our shinobi!

466
00:28:36,697 --> 00:28:40,284
War...
So it's finally come to that.

467
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:44,356
You were invited to this war council,
but you're still young.

468
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,891
Keep your ears open
and don't miss a thing.

469
00:28:47,345 --> 00:28:50,182
Yeah. I know that.

470
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,441
I will make full use of my head
and hammer everything in!

471
00:28:56,554 --> 00:28:58,640
<i>It doesn't rhyme.</i>

472
00:29:00,272 --> 00:29:02,858
<i>Isn't there a nice phrase?</i>

473
00:29:03,459 --> 00:29:06,613
Unless we are sure about the enemy's
headquarters, and where their hideout is,

474
00:29:06,652 --> 00:29:09,030
it will be difficult to launch
an effective surprise attack.

475
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:12,000
And so, we will first dispatch
a reconnaissance team.

476
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,482
All right.

477
00:29:13,507 --> 00:29:15,967
– To maximize their efforts, we will have
– <i>"All right," eh?</i>

478
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,214
– three surprise attack formations.
– <i>Lacks originality.</i>

479
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,215
To ensure success,

480
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,676
– each formation must be comprised of
– <i>What if I switch it around like...</i>

481
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:24,053
– expert shinobi from every nation.
– <i>Aight, yo?</i>

482
00:29:24,372 --> 00:29:28,334
<i>Right-o... And then I add
a little rap flavor and...</i>

483
00:29:28,605 --> 00:29:30,234
<i>Aight, yo.</i>

484
00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:32,845
<i>Aight, yo. Aight, yo. Aight, yo...</i>

485
00:29:33,066 --> 00:29:35,277
<i>This gives us
a pretty clear picture of</i>

486
00:29:35,302 --> 00:29:37,638
<i>the Hidden Cloud's military strength.</i>

487
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:41,237
<i>Lucky for us,
the Eight-Tails is a fool.</i>

488
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:44,355
<i>It's not working.</i>

489
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,841
<i>This phrase is making me mad!</i>

490
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:49,429
<i>Can't figure it out.</i>

491
00:29:50,201 --> 00:29:53,079
We don't have current intel
about the enemy,

492
00:29:53,165 --> 00:29:55,709
so we must rely on intel from
the others to assess the situation.

493
00:29:56,271 --> 00:29:57,633
So we're to go empty-handed

494
00:29:57,658 --> 00:29:59,577
and depend on intel
from other villages?

495
00:30:00,161 --> 00:30:02,330
Will they even share their data?

496
00:30:03,312 --> 00:30:06,065
If they refuse to divulge
what they know,

497
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:08,348
then the Allied Shinobi Force
is meaningless.

498
00:30:08,925 --> 00:30:10,427
We'll just have to trust them.

499
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,313
We don't have time to waste.

500
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:20,985
At this very moment,
Madara Uchiha is preparing for war.

501
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:23,613
All right!

502
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:27,033
We will hold a meeting of
the Allied Shinobi Force in three days!

503
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,536
Send word to each village!

504
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,497
Naruto!

505
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:34,051
Huh?!

506
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,211
So Grandma Tsunade is fine now?

507
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:39,612
Yes!

508
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:40,987
All right!

509
00:30:41,012 --> 00:30:44,099
Is that right?
I'm happy about Lady Tsunade.

510
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:47,720
Okay! Since this is good news,
the ramen is on me!

511
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,264
Huh?! Are you sure?!

512
00:30:49,652 --> 00:30:51,154
Why don't you have some too, Sakura?

513
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:54,978
No, thanks.
I still have more people to notify.

514
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,439
Well, I'll see you later, Naruto!

515
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:04,779
Now that that's off my mind,
I feel hungrier than ever!

516
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:09,158
Okay! I'm eating my fill today.

517
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,411
One bowl, two bowls, three bowls!

518
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,496
Here you go!

519
00:31:13,673 --> 00:31:16,015
It's a special tonkotsu miso
with BBQ pork slices

520
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,417
to celebrate the Hokage's recovery!

521
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:18,918
Whoa!

522
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,463
Thank you for the...

523
00:31:23,416 --> 00:31:24,793
Oh? He disappeared.

524
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,719
... food!

525
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,769
I'm surprised he dug right
into the food.

526
00:31:36,934 --> 00:31:40,965
Looks like he really loves
my bug cooking!

527
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:54,162
What am I doing here again?

528
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,582
I did a Reverse Summoning on you.

529
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:01,169
The Great Lord Elder will
divine your future, Naruto-boy.

530
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:04,505
Divine?

531
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,012
Follow me.

532
00:32:13,753 --> 00:32:16,172
Don't throw it up!

533
00:32:24,382 --> 00:32:25,925
I have brought him.

534
00:32:26,002 --> 00:32:29,881
Hey! Long time no see,
Giant Gramps Sage!

535
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:38,539
It was indeed I who
summoned you... er... umm...

536
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,502
Who are you again?

537
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,172
Naruto Uzumaki!

538
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:51,219
I wish you'd hurry up and
learn my name, Giant Gramps Sage!

539
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:56,265
Oh, that's right, that's right.
It's Naruto.

540
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,601
Listen, Naruto.

541
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,562
I have seen
a prophecy involving you.

542
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:05,817
A prophecy?
Okay, I'm ready for it.

543
00:33:07,175 --> 00:33:10,053
In that case, listen carefully.

544
00:33:12,283 --> 00:33:14,952
You will soon be meeting
an octopus.

545
00:33:17,144 --> 00:33:18,145
An octopus?

546
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:24,043
Why an octopus?

547
00:33:24,666 --> 00:33:28,169
Well, I couldn't see too clearly,

548
00:33:28,194 --> 00:33:30,446
but I'm sure they were tentacles.

549
00:33:32,442 --> 00:33:34,778
And then, it will come to pass that

550
00:33:34,803 --> 00:33:38,840
you will fight a young man
whose power lies in his eyes.

551
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,770
And...

552
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,731
Yeah... I know.

553
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:48,067
What do you mean, "you know"?

554
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:54,198
So you saw it?

555
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:55,993
Yeah.

556
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,995
That young man whose power
lies in his eyes...

557
00:33:59,701 --> 00:34:02,787
Do you know who that is?!

558
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:07,253
Yeah, and I've already
made up my mind.

559
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:13,718
Gerotora...

560
00:34:14,111 --> 00:34:17,030
I also saw a dream where
you stored yourself inside Naruto.

561
00:34:17,146 --> 00:34:18,606
Wh-What?!

562
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:22,310
Give him the Fourth Hokage's seal.

563
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:28,399
I have no choice but to do
as you say, Great Lord Elder.

564
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,240
What is this?

565
00:34:36,548 --> 00:34:38,604
It is the key left by
the Fourth Hokage

566
00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:42,038
that locks and unlocks
the sealing jutsu on your stomach!

567
00:34:43,723 --> 00:34:46,071
With this you can let
the Nine-Tails run free,

568
00:34:46,096 --> 00:34:48,264
if that's what you want.

569
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,716
Place your hand on that square area.

570
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:04,268
With this, you will have
the means to perfect that jutsu

571
00:35:04,465 --> 00:35:06,842
that Jiraiya was talking about.

572
00:35:08,949 --> 00:35:10,951
The key to release...

573
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,986
the Nine-Tails' seal.

574
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:21,869
Are you unsure, Naruto?

575
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,667
What are you waiting for?

576
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:30,169
Press the Storing Square!

577
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,674
You're unsure, right, Naruto?

578
00:35:35,232 --> 00:35:37,610
I can't say that I blame you.

579
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,137
What do you mean?

580
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:40,596
Lord Fukasaku...

581
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:46,769
The Nine-Tails gets its power
by merging its chakra with its will.

582
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,743
To control this power,

583
00:35:49,831 --> 00:35:52,233
you must isolate
only the Nine-Tails' chakra,

584
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:55,903
assimilate it into your own chakra
and make it your own power.

585
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:59,073
But it's easier said than done.

586
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:04,537
If you pull out the Nine-Tails' chakra,
you also draw out its will.

587
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:11,711
The Nine-Tails' will is a mass of hatred
that binds itself tightly to chakra.

588
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:14,338
No matter how hard you try
to shield yourself,

589
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:17,341
it will find some hatred that
you have buried deep inside

590
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,010
and it will try to overtake you.

591
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,806
In other words,

592
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:29,478
controlling the Nine-Tails' power
means taking its will and its chakra

593
00:36:29,997 --> 00:36:33,793
and completely separating the two
with your own strong will

594
00:36:33,818 --> 00:36:36,321
which should harbor no hatred.

595
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,700
The Fourth Hokage made
the Nine-Tails' seal in a way

596
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:45,494
that allows a small amount of its chakra
to leak out of the cage

597
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:48,873
in hopes that it would naturally
become one with Naruto's own chakra.

598
00:36:49,908 --> 00:36:52,760
It is known as the Eight Trigrams Sealing.

599
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,755
It consists of two Tetragram Seals.

600
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,633
But if this key is used to
open the Tetragram Seal,

601
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:02,178
you could pull out all
the Nine-Tails' chakra!

602
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,972
And that means all
the Nine-Tails' will

603
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:07,767
would be drawn out along with
all of its chakra!

604
00:37:08,212 --> 00:37:11,761
And as soon as Naruto's will
loses to the Nine-Tails' will...

605
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:15,650
The Nine-Tails will be
completely resurrected!

606
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:18,236
<i>How terrible.</i>

607
00:37:19,289 --> 00:37:22,959
And has the key ever been used?

608
00:37:25,108 --> 00:37:28,304
A while ago, the Tetragram Seal
was weakening.

609
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,331
So in order to control Naruto,

610
00:37:30,356 --> 00:37:32,775
who was starting to transform into
the Nine-Tails during training,

611
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,136
Jiraiya used the key to
tighten the seal on him.

612
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,560
This should hold for a while.

613
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,438
Just a while, huh?

614
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:09,412
What's the matter, Pervy Sage?

615
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,456
<i>Jiraiya was greatly concerned.</i>

616
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:17,712
<i>If the Fourth Hokage's Sealing Formula
was beginning to weaken,</i>

617
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:22,591
<i>there was no telling when Naruto would
transform into the Nine-Tails again.</i>

618
00:38:25,033 --> 00:38:27,076
I guess I'll try it.

619
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:28,597
Huh?!

620
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,590
A toad came out of your mouth!

621
00:38:39,091 --> 00:38:41,802
Don't be so hard on me, Jiraiya!

622
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:44,405
You just summoned me
a while ago.

623
00:38:44,938 --> 00:38:48,983
I need a favor.
Will you hear me out, Gerotora?

624
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:52,288
It's Naruto's Tetragram Seal.

625
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:55,124
Hey, hey... You just tightened the seal.

626
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:57,379
Do you want it tighter?

627
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,879
No, the reverse.

628
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,966
I want to loosen it just a little bit.

629
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,301
Wha—?!

630
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:09,847
<i>Jiraiya wanted the seal to be opened
deliberately for just a short while</i>

631
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:14,853
<i>in order to train Naruto to develop
the power to resist the Nine-Tails' will.</i>

632
00:39:15,192 --> 00:39:17,444
But it didn't work.

633
00:39:17,778 --> 00:39:21,323
I didn't mean to hurt Pervy Sage.

634
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:24,653
The harder I try to become strong,

635
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,074
the tighter the grip of
the Nine-Tails' will becomes.

636
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:32,578
He totally ignores my will and
tries to hurt everyone in my path.

637
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:37,375
That was the result of opening
Naruto's key just a tiny bit.

638
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:42,296
So that's the reason for the scar
on Jiraiya-boy's chest.

639
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,299
And then what happened?

640
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,343
Nothing good.

641
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:52,890
Right now, I feel safe, since
Fourth Hokage's seal has been tightened.

642
00:39:57,639 --> 00:40:00,183
But it might act up again at any time.

643
00:40:00,819 --> 00:40:02,821
Yet in order to fight Sasuke,

644
00:40:03,172 --> 00:40:05,425
I have to use
the Nine-Tails' chakra.

645
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,240
I'm the Nine-Tails' Jinchuriki, after all.

646
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,326
I can't hide from that forever.

647
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:17,039
<i>I sealed half of the Nine-Tails' chakra
inside of you,</i>

648
00:40:17,369 --> 00:40:20,247
<i>because I believed
you could control its power.</i>

649
00:40:21,433 --> 00:40:23,268
<i>Right, Dad?</i>

650
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:26,528
<i>Hurting my friends...</i>

651
00:40:27,314 --> 00:40:29,316
<i>Giving in to hatred...</i>

652
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,441
<i>It's no use getting hesitant.</i>

653
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:50,030
<i>I understand now just how dangerous
it is to release the Nine-Tails' chakra.</i>

654
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:54,452
<i>But he has the Fourth Hokage's love</i>

655
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:57,496
<i>and that sheer determination
that Jiraiya instilled in him.</i>

656
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,961
Contract complete.
I'm going into storage!

657
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:07,047
Huh? Going into storage?

658
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:11,886
You don't need to do a thing.
Just keep your mouth open.

659
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:13,846
Mouth?

660
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:16,015
Yes. Now say “ahh.”

661
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,810
Wider.

662
00:41:22,735 --> 00:41:24,999
Here I go... into storage.

663
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,241
Hey! Open wider!

664
00:41:30,476 --> 00:41:32,645
Are you going to let me go
into storage?!

665
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,575
<i>Why through my mouth?!</i>

666
00:41:34,752 --> 00:41:36,613
<i>It's slimy and feels awful.</i>

667
00:41:44,409 --> 00:41:46,160
Okay, storage complete!

668
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:49,215
I'm taking you back to
Hidden Leaf Village.

669
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,842
After that, we'll have to
look for the octopus.

670
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:56,347
Oh, right... You prophesied that
I would encounter an octopus.

671
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:01,101
Where is this octopus?
Can't you give more clues?

672
00:42:01,387 --> 00:42:03,722
It's not clear,
but it's a solitary island.

673
00:42:04,009 --> 00:42:05,611
People don't go near it.

674
00:42:05,636 --> 00:42:07,333
It's like a paradise for creatures.

675
00:42:07,661 --> 00:42:10,807
To me, it seems it would be
a fun resort.

676
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:20,579
And there, the octopus should be
of help to you.

677
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,832
In any case, you will find your way.

678
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,209
Right!

679
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:27,086
All right, I'm sending you back.

680
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:32,758
I'm back.

681
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,385
Where'd you go?

682
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:37,513
I thought you suddenly disappeared,
and now you're back!

683
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:39,723
I had something to do.

684
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,141
Oh, Naruto!

685
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:44,395
They said you suddenly disappeared
and everyone's in an uproar.

686
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:45,896
Huh? No kidding!

687
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,608
I never thought I'd run into you here.

688
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:52,611
Oh hey!
Give me your autograph!

689
00:42:53,265 --> 00:42:57,019
Could you make it out to my kid.
He's a big fan of yours.

690
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:59,285
Autograph?

691
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,662
The hero of the Hidden Leaf.

692
00:43:01,687 --> 00:43:04,147
The kid who created a miracle,
Naruto Uzumaki.

693
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,376
Give me your autograph too!

694
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,421
What's wrong? You won't do it?

695
00:43:10,687 --> 00:43:14,525
It's not that. I'm just not used
to that sort of thing.

696
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,468
I don't have a clue what to sign.

697
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:20,848
<i>Everyone's making a fuss
over him lately as the miracle kid.</i>

698
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:23,517
<i>But until just recently,
it was just the opposite.</i>

699
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:25,185
<i>I can't blame the boy.</i>

700
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:29,982
Gentlemen, will you let him eat
a bowl of ramen before that?

701
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,442
Oh, sure...

702
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:33,110
Yes!

703
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,697
I finally get to eat!

704
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,282
Naruto!

705
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:40,034
Oh Sakura!

706
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,580
Where have you been?!

707
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:47,416
Where? I was suddenly
summoned and...

708
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:49,512
Just come with me right now!

709
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:52,463
Lady Tsunade and everyone else
are worried about you!

710
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:55,507
Oww... Sakura!
Let me eat my ramen!

711
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,009
That can wait.

712
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:05,684
There's no mistake,
it's Kabuto's doing.

713
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,728
This method of killing...

714
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:10,981
Kabuto is becoming more
like Orochimaru.

715
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:16,153
But why would he leave
a trail like this?

716
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:17,237
He would...

717
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:19,114
Is this deliberate?

718
00:44:20,286 --> 00:44:21,746
What does he intend to do?

719
00:44:22,295 --> 00:44:25,798
No doubt Kabuto is carrying
on Orochimaru's will.

720
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:31,043
Now, is he going after
the Hidden Leaf or the Akatsuki?

721
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,047
Let's start with the greetings,
shall we, Tobi?

722
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:36,590
No...

723
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,927
You call yourself Madara now.

724
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,221
You did well to find this place.

725
00:44:43,229 --> 00:44:46,065
I roamed from country to country as a spy

726
00:44:46,507 --> 00:44:48,702
and I once belonged to the Akatsuki.

727
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:50,896
Don't underestimate my intel network.

728
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:54,108
You were once one of Sasori's spies.

729
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,777
You are a traitor to the Akatsuki.

730
00:45:06,695 --> 00:45:07,696
<i>This is...</i>

731
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,055
Reanimation Jutsu.

732
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:30,352
The Forbidden Jutsu known only to
the Second Hokage and Lord Orochimaru.

733
00:45:30,701 --> 00:45:32,662
Now, I'm the third one.

734
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,525
And I have surpassed
the previous two.

735
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:39,570
This performance is dedicated to you.

736
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:42,990
So that you would believe
in my power and trust in me.

737
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:45,284
Rest assured.

738
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:47,953
I did not come here to fight.

739
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:49,997
What do you want?

740
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:52,750
I want us to join forces.

741
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,003
Join forces?

742
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:59,798
How will that benefit me?

743
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:03,135
I understand you intend
to start a war soon.

744
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:06,263
I'm offering to provide
more military might.

745
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,725
With these here...

746
00:46:09,795 --> 00:46:10,710
Itachi.

747
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,561
Sasori.

748
00:46:13,406 --> 00:46:14,438
Deidara.

749
00:46:15,318 --> 00:46:16,267
Kakuzu.

750
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,525
And Nagato.

751
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:21,320
They each have formidable strength.

752
00:46:21,609 --> 00:46:25,112
And I have even more up my sleeve.

753
00:46:27,558 --> 00:46:28,601
And in exchange?

754
00:46:29,015 --> 00:46:30,392
Sasuke Uchiha.

755
00:46:35,108 --> 00:46:36,777
What are you plotting?

756
00:46:37,809 --> 00:46:39,143
Nothing really.

757
00:46:40,325 --> 00:46:43,995
I am only interested in
the pure truth behind ninjutsu.

758
00:46:44,328 --> 00:46:47,456
And I need Sasuke
to pursue this.

759
00:46:49,018 --> 00:46:52,396
I need a young, live,
sensitive Uchiha.

760
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,853
And if I refuse?

761
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:59,109
<i>Summoning Jutsu: Reanimation.</i>

762
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:13,000
Th-This is...

763
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:17,538
Surely, you didn't think that
I would come unprepared.

764
00:47:19,013 --> 00:47:21,265
Yes. You can't refuse.

765
00:47:21,918 --> 00:47:23,086
Why you...

766
00:47:23,511 --> 00:47:25,472
Where did you get that?

767
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,511
I have my means.

768
00:47:28,024 --> 00:47:31,445
Don't worry. I haven't told
anyone about this.

769
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:42,359
What's so funny?

770
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,403
Kabuto Yakushi.

771
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:49,074
Never did I imagine that
you would come this far.

772
00:47:50,797 --> 00:47:54,301
Arguing with you now will
only weaken our side.

773
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:57,291
You came here,
waiting for the perfect opportunity.

774
00:47:57,546 --> 00:47:59,507
You are very careful indeed.

775
00:47:59,699 --> 00:48:01,076
What do you mean?

776
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:03,839
So be it.
We will join forces with you.

777
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:07,676
But only on the condition that
I hand Sasuke over to you

778
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,303
after victory in this war is assured.

779
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:12,055
You will not be allowed to
see Sasuke until then.

780
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:14,892
You understand things clearly.

781
00:48:15,373 --> 00:48:17,166
I expected no less
from Madara Uchiha.

782
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:18,938
Your vessel is unique.

783
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,856
And you are insolent.

784
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:26,153
I'll reformulate my strategy after
I confirm your battle strength.

785
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:27,785
Follow me.

786
00:48:42,231 --> 00:48:44,692
He brought corpses all the way
to this desolate place?

787
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:47,711
Judging from the way
the shinobi's bodies are strewn about,

788
00:48:47,736 --> 00:48:49,738
I'll bet there's something up ahead.

789
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:53,096
I originally thought we'd pursue him
by way of Hidden Waterfall,

790
00:48:53,362 --> 00:48:56,282
and back to Hidden Leaf Village.

791
00:48:57,767 --> 00:49:01,697
<i>But it's like he wants us
to follow him.</i>

792
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,244
<i>I don't get it.</i>

793
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:04,983
Is it a trap then?

794
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,401
What do we do?

795
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,500
Tokuma! Use your Byakugan
at two o'clock!

796
00:49:10,833 --> 00:49:11,599
Right!

797
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,283
<i>Byakugan!</i>

798
00:49:23,817 --> 00:49:25,777
Captain Mitarashi! This is...

799
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,089
What's the matter?

800
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:28,674
It's not just Kabuto!

801
00:49:28,885 --> 00:49:31,221
He's with a masked member
of the Akatsuki!

802
00:49:31,354 --> 00:49:34,024
The two of them are going through
some kind of underground entrance!

803
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:35,389
What?!

804
00:49:35,882 --> 00:49:37,216
A masked man?

805
00:49:37,463 --> 00:49:40,298
Is it the one who calls
himself Madara?

806
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,063
Does this mean
we found his hideout?

807
00:49:43,769 --> 00:49:45,896
What is he doing with Kabuto?

808
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:47,567
Have they joined forces?

809
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,613
Did Kabuto purposely lure us here?

810
00:49:52,161 --> 00:49:54,163
In order to show us
Madara's hideout?

811
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:58,412
But why? If they've joined forces...

812
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,743
I don't know yet.

813
00:50:01,783 --> 00:50:04,494
But we need to send word to
the village immediately!

814
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:24,688
You all came quickly.

815
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:28,066
The situation calls for quick action.

816
00:50:28,571 --> 00:50:32,491
Princess Tsunade.
Are you really all right?

817
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:36,783
This is the perfect opportunity
to hand things over to a youngster.

818
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,785
You're old too.

819
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,415
Speak for yourself,
you Fence-Sitter geezer!

820
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:45,917
Setting aside the matter of Danzo,

821
00:50:46,101 --> 00:50:49,939
I'm relieved that you are back
as the Hokage, Lady Tsunade.

822
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:54,801
Let us be done with the greetings
and get right to business.

823
00:50:55,121 --> 00:50:58,484
First on the agenda are the Jinchuriki
of the Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails.

824
00:50:59,048 --> 00:51:01,133
Then we will go on to any intel

825
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:03,577
relating to the enemy's headquarters
and military strength.

826
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:05,979
My shinobi have pinned
down a location

827
00:51:06,141 --> 00:51:07,976
that may be the enemy's stronghold.

828
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:09,929
But it may be a trap.

829
00:51:10,743 --> 00:51:13,037
We have no choice but to wait
for more intel on this.

830
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:18,742
I also have a reconnaissance team
gathering intel.

831
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:23,163
We need to sort through the intel
from each village quickly.

832
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:26,083
How about forming a separate unit
within the Allied Force

833
00:51:26,238 --> 00:51:28,365
that only handles intel?

834
00:51:28,561 --> 00:51:32,523
Good idea!
Share and share alike!

835
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:34,382
That goes without saying!

836
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:38,386
If each nation becomes driven
by self-interest,

837
00:51:38,568 --> 00:51:41,821
the Akatsuki will pull the rug out
from under us.

838
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:46,228
So, where will we hide
the crucial Jinchuriki?

839
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:48,230
Hide them?

840
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:49,940
What is it?

841
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:52,484
Naruto and Bee can lend much
strength to this battle.

842
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:53,944
Why hide them away?

843
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:55,779
I thought so as well.

844
00:51:55,939 --> 00:51:59,859
But those two are what the enemy
is after in this war.

845
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,370
Considering what could happen,
we cannot let them participate.

846
00:52:03,699 --> 00:52:06,081
It was decided at the last meeting,

847
00:52:06,485 --> 00:52:08,820
but you, of course,
were still ill.

848
00:52:08,994 --> 00:52:10,537
Our enemy is Madara!

849
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:13,664
If we hold back battle strength and
lose the prospect of victory,

850
00:52:13,689 --> 00:52:15,524
we are not going to get another chance.

851
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:16,925
We must hit them with
everything we've got—

852
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:19,219
The Five Great Nations
joined together and

853
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:21,304
our aim in this war is
to protect those two.

854
00:52:21,548 --> 00:52:24,009
Your sole dissent as Hokage
is not sufficient.

855
00:52:24,279 --> 00:52:25,905
We will decide this
with majority rule.

856
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:28,728
You child! Naruto is—

857
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:31,356
I know him quite well.

858
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:32,899
That is exactly why.

859
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,487
Before we even talk
about military strength,

860
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:39,447
the five Kage must reach a consensus.

861
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:42,158
Otherwise, there will be no victory.

862
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,995
I agree, Lady Tsunade.

863
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,081
It's fine!

864
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:51,334
The Slug Princess is back
to her impudent self.

865
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,795
It's proof that she is well.

866
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:57,632
We will now need to decide where
to hide the Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails.

867
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,801
Any objections, Hokage?

868
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,972
I understand.
Get on with it!

869
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:07,684
I have a place in mind.

870
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:10,136
And it is appropriately located
in the Hidden Cloud,

871
00:53:10,161 --> 00:53:12,638
which has not produced
any Akatsuki members.

872
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:14,983
I set it aside, just in case.

873
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:21,364
S-rank mission?!

874
00:53:21,739 --> 00:53:24,408
You're assigning me to
an important mission like that?

875
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:28,371
Yes. This is a mission that
only you can undertake.

876
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:32,375
You and Yamato will go to a certain
place in the Hidden Cloud region.

877
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:39,299
Is that the resort?

878
00:53:39,703 --> 00:53:42,373
The Great Lord Elder's prophecy
was accurate.

879
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,096
It seems that is the place
he foresaw.

880
00:53:45,443 --> 00:53:49,322
Then I'm going to see the octopus
at this resort island?

881
00:53:49,618 --> 00:53:51,536
I feel sorta bad!

882
00:53:51,794 --> 00:53:55,360
Everyone's so busy and
I get to go to a resort.

883
00:53:55,385 --> 00:53:59,014
You fool! You are going on a mission!

884
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:01,791
I know. Just joking, just joking.

885
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:05,450
But about going to this place
that was prophesied...

886
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:11,150
Is it connected to the other one?
That I'll fight with Sasuke?

887
00:54:11,652 --> 00:54:13,988
That, I don't know.

888
00:54:14,382 --> 00:54:17,844
However, we are on the verge of war!

889
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:20,340
Hence, this S-rank mission.

890
00:54:20,828 --> 00:54:23,873
When you get to the site,
you will follow Yamato's orders.

891
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:27,847
Okay! I understand!

892
00:54:28,479 --> 00:54:31,274
You can count on me
for this S-rank mission!

893
00:54:54,428 --> 00:54:57,493
We're going to freeze out here.
Let's go back.

894
00:55:05,317 --> 00:55:09,147
<i>I'll bear the burden of your hate,
and we'll die together.</i>

895
00:55:11,759 --> 00:55:12,726
What's wrong?

896
00:55:14,212 --> 00:55:15,520
Nothing at all...

897
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:55,386
Octopus, octopus, octopus!

898
00:55:55,511 --> 00:55:56,329
Octopus?

899
00:55:56,685 --> 00:55:58,687
An octopus is supposed
to help guide me.

900
00:55:58,973 --> 00:56:01,392
Remember?
Giant Gramps Sage foretold it.

901
00:56:01,845 --> 00:56:03,847
That's right, it was an octopus.

902
00:56:04,437 --> 00:56:07,231
He was right about this being
an isolated island paradise.

903
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:10,401
I'm sure there's no mistake about
meeting someone to guide me.

904
00:56:11,527 --> 00:56:14,614
<i>Naruto hasn't figured it out yet.</i>

905
00:56:15,948 --> 00:56:19,035
Please start preparing
to disembark soon.

906
00:56:19,234 --> 00:56:21,820
Oh! I can see the island!

907
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:23,331
It's true!

908
00:56:38,262 --> 00:56:40,431
An... island paradise?

909
00:56:40,932 --> 00:56:43,351
It's like the Hidden Leaf's
Forest of Death.

910
00:56:43,601 --> 00:56:45,811
But this is a bit more extreme.

911
00:56:46,354 --> 00:56:47,396
This is a resort?

912
00:56:47,939 --> 00:56:49,690
Don't worry it's safe.

913
00:56:50,024 --> 00:56:54,403
As long as we don't provoke them,
the creatures are quite docile.

914
00:56:54,612 --> 00:56:55,988
Except for one...

915
00:56:56,030 --> 00:56:57,740
"Except for one" what?

916
00:56:57,823 --> 00:56:59,450
What part of this place
is a paradise?!

917
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:01,619
You liar, Giant Gramps Sage!

918
00:57:01,994 --> 00:57:03,871
For one that lives along the shore...

919
00:57:05,206 --> 00:57:07,500
Huh? Octopus tentacles!

920
00:57:09,085 --> 00:57:13,047
Okay, octopus! Come and guide me!

921
00:57:13,047 --> 00:57:14,924
Naruto, this is actually a...

922
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:20,721
a squid!

923
00:57:25,434 --> 00:57:26,560
It's here!

924
00:57:26,602 --> 00:57:28,729
I was just about to warn you
that he's the one

925
00:57:28,729 --> 00:57:30,527
you have to be careful about,
but he appeared before I could!

926
00:57:30,552 --> 00:57:31,553
– What?!
– What?!

927
00:57:31,732 --> 00:57:33,901
One, two, three...

928
00:57:33,943 --> 00:57:35,987
It's obvious without
counting its tentacles!

929
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:37,488
Naruto, come on!

930
00:57:38,406 --> 00:57:40,491
But we should make sure.

931
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:43,651
A squid has ten legs.
An octopus has eight.

932
00:57:44,056 --> 00:57:47,434
If this is the octopus who's going
to help guide me...

933
00:57:48,899 --> 00:57:49,900
Naruto?!

934
00:57:56,257 --> 00:57:58,843
<i>This Squid's a deviation...
I'll save the explanation!</i>

935
00:58:00,469 --> 00:58:01,637
What the—?!

936
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:04,682
Here comes another one
saying weird puns!

937
00:58:04,932 --> 00:58:06,559
This is so confusing!

938
00:58:07,059 --> 00:58:09,770
6, 7, 8...

939
00:58:09,979 --> 00:58:11,355
It's an octopus!

940
00:58:11,652 --> 00:58:13,320
This one is an octopus!

941
00:58:13,482 --> 00:58:14,942
Is that really an octopus?

942
00:58:19,155 --> 00:58:20,323
Master Killer Bee!

943
00:58:20,573 --> 00:58:21,657
Killer Bee?

944
00:58:21,959 --> 00:58:23,503
Then this octopus is...

945
00:58:23,945 --> 00:58:27,032
Y'all are late, fools, ya fools!

946
00:58:32,297 --> 00:58:33,632
It changed into a human?

947
00:58:33,919 --> 00:58:36,297
Hey, ya know Octopops, thanks!

948
00:58:36,767 --> 00:58:38,268
Ya know...

949
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:41,927
What?

950
00:58:46,349 --> 00:58:49,310
Will we clash
or make a splash?

951
00:58:49,352 --> 00:58:51,812
Take it from me,
it's a no-go, WHEE!

952
00:58:51,854 --> 00:58:56,359
Cause I'm a brat-hatin' outlaw...

953
00:58:56,701 --> 00:58:58,294
What's up with
this beefy guy in shades,

954
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:00,237
singing lame puns at
the top of his lungs?

955
00:59:01,072 --> 00:59:03,741
<i>Is this geezer the octopus
who's going to guide me?</i>

956
00:59:04,116 --> 00:59:05,659
They're not puns.

957
00:59:05,701 --> 00:59:07,067
It's his original style,

958
00:59:07,092 --> 00:59:10,679
a combination of Enka singing
to a rap beat. Enka Rap!

959
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:12,815
Enka rap?

960
00:59:14,377 --> 00:59:17,797
Welcome, everyone!
I've been waiting for you.

961
00:59:19,565 --> 00:59:22,253
I am Supervisor Motoi
and I'll take care of your needs.

962
00:59:22,927 --> 00:59:25,638
I'll take you to your lodgings,
so please follow me.

963
00:59:28,182 --> 00:59:29,809
Oh, we're finally here?

964
00:59:30,267 --> 00:59:33,562
We're standing on solid ground,
Guy. Get a hold of yourself!

965
00:59:36,732 --> 00:59:39,193
Is Bushier Brow-sensei all right?

966
00:59:39,753 --> 00:59:43,030
He never got over
his seasickness, did he?

967
00:59:43,273 --> 00:59:45,442
We were at sea for a long time.

968
00:59:45,908 --> 00:59:49,203
It sure was long.
It sure was painful.

969
00:59:57,545 --> 01:00:00,339
Is this really a paradise?

970
01:00:02,156 --> 01:00:04,035
I still feel woozy.

971
01:00:08,264 --> 01:00:09,723
Hey, King, no need to panic!

972
01:00:09,765 --> 01:00:11,350
These guys are okay.

973
01:00:13,936 --> 01:00:15,229
It's a gorilla! A gorilla!

974
01:00:15,521 --> 01:00:17,606
Is this a gorilla?

975
01:00:18,218 --> 01:00:21,180
Master Bee stands at the top
of this island's hierarchy of beasts.

976
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,320
He's tamed them all.

977
01:00:23,779 --> 01:00:27,533
So as long as he is around,
it's safe here.

978
01:00:28,451 --> 01:00:32,997
Furthermore, Hidden Cloud shinobi
maintain a barrier around the island.

979
01:00:33,038 --> 01:00:36,834
We'll know immediately if
anyone suspicious approaches.

980
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:40,911
<i>Which is why this place
was chosen to detain them.</i>

981
01:00:41,375 --> 01:00:44,378
Who the hell is that
shades-wearing pops?

982
01:00:44,925 --> 01:00:47,636
He is the Hidden Cloud's hero
among heroes.

983
01:00:47,928 --> 01:00:48,929
Hero?

984
01:00:49,346 --> 01:00:51,278
He's someone who not only
tamed these wild animals,

985
01:00:51,303 --> 01:00:54,056
he is a Jinchuriki
who can control Tailed Beasts.

986
01:00:56,061 --> 01:00:59,148
He is a Jinchuriki like you...
of Eight-Tails.

987
01:00:59,857 --> 01:01:02,026
The Eight-Tails' Jinchuriki?

988
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:04,706
And he can control it?

989
01:01:05,446 --> 01:01:06,572
That old guy?

990
01:01:07,364 --> 01:01:08,824
He's Master Killer Bee.

991
01:01:10,034 --> 01:01:11,035
Yo!

992
01:01:11,676 --> 01:01:13,512
This island is also
where he trained

993
01:01:13,537 --> 01:01:15,831
to gain control over the Eight-Tails.

994
01:01:25,174 --> 01:01:27,801
The Hidden Leaf can use this floor.

995
01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:29,919
There are ample rooms.

996
01:01:30,179 --> 01:01:33,432
Eat all you want in the great
dining hall on the first floor.

997
01:01:33,474 --> 01:01:36,101
Choose whatever rooms you want.

998
01:01:36,435 --> 01:01:39,104
We'll adjourn until the meeting
tomorrow morning at seven.

999
01:01:40,564 --> 01:01:44,193
I'm going to rest for awhile.

1000
01:01:56,789 --> 01:01:58,332
Ahh, it's the "ya know" brat.

1001
01:01:58,535 --> 01:01:59,416
What's up?

1002
01:01:59,458 --> 01:02:01,919
You want an autograph from me?

1003
01:02:02,795 --> 01:02:04,380
Train me!

1004
01:02:04,797 --> 01:02:05,923
Train you?

1005
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:09,197
I'm the Jinchuriki of the Nine-Tails.

1006
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,471
But I can't control it yet.

1007
01:02:12,999 --> 01:02:16,126
So please teach me
how to control a Tailed Beast.

1008
01:02:18,635 --> 01:02:19,645
No way.

1009
01:02:21,855 --> 01:02:23,899
I came here because
my brother, the Raikage,

1010
01:02:23,941 --> 01:02:25,901
ordered me to take a vacation...

1011
01:02:26,151 --> 01:02:30,698
Why should I give up
a rare vacation for that reason?

1012
01:02:30,871 --> 01:02:32,604
Fool, ya fool!

1013
01:02:33,198 --> 01:02:35,700
Because we're both Jinchuriki!

1014
01:02:35,876 --> 01:02:38,545
Why won't you help me out?

1015
01:02:38,931 --> 01:02:42,477
Your attitude is huge, I see.
Stop acting so shamelessly! Whee!

1016
01:02:46,812 --> 01:02:48,772
Old man!
Cool shades!

1017
01:02:48,797 --> 01:02:51,508
With a face that's tan,
you've really got it made! Whee!

1018
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:55,931
Hey kid, you've got good style.

1019
01:02:56,098 --> 01:02:58,392
<i>Yes! He's starting to like me!</i>

1020
01:02:59,226 --> 01:03:00,227
Yo!

1021
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,980
First comes the greeting!

1022
01:03:03,022 --> 01:03:06,942
We start with fist bumps,
while we keep rapping.

1023
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:12,049
Hey old buddy...

1024
01:03:12,074 --> 01:03:13,367
Those shades sure look funny...

1025
01:03:15,646 --> 01:03:17,147
<i>Shouldn't have said that!</i>

1026
01:03:17,995 --> 01:03:19,705
<i>Oh well, what the hell.</i>

1027
01:03:20,914 --> 01:03:22,166
<i>Harem Jutsu!</i>

1028
01:03:23,988 --> 01:03:26,491
I've been begging for
so long on my knees.

1029
01:03:26,532 --> 01:03:28,116
Come on, my dear.

1030
01:03:28,141 --> 01:03:30,227
Teach me control.

1031
01:03:31,175 --> 01:03:34,094
Please...

1032
01:03:36,764 --> 01:03:38,098
<i>How's that?</i>

1033
01:03:38,361 --> 01:03:40,864
<i>All men fall for this jutsu!</i>

1034
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,317
Hey old man! Old man!

1035
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:50,751
You're stingy!

1036
01:03:53,822 --> 01:03:55,157
<i>What's with that guy?!</i>

1037
01:03:55,492 --> 01:03:56,994
<i>All he does is talk in rhymes.</i>

1038
01:03:57,304 --> 01:04:00,015
<i>Whoever heard of
an octopus that raps?!</i>

1039
01:04:02,268 --> 01:04:03,287
What do you want?

1040
01:04:03,791 --> 01:04:06,085
Show me how the old man
wearing shades

1041
01:04:06,126 --> 01:04:08,128
trained to control the Eight-Tails.

1042
01:04:08,796 --> 01:04:10,172
He trained here, right?

1043
01:04:11,271 --> 01:04:13,159
Oh, you're talking about Bee.

1044
01:04:13,184 --> 01:04:17,780
He won't give me the time of day,
so I came to ask you instead!

1045
01:04:18,681 --> 01:04:19,682
Me?

1046
01:04:19,723 --> 01:04:22,726
I don't care if he's the hero
of the Hidden Cloud or what...

1047
01:04:22,768 --> 01:04:26,021
He's selfish and stubborn,
and talks only in rhymes.

1048
01:04:26,146 --> 01:04:27,656
We're both Jinchuriki,

1049
01:04:27,681 --> 01:04:30,627
so why can't he be
more understanding?

1050
01:04:30,859 --> 01:04:33,654
– I mean...
– What do you know about Bee?!

1051
01:04:33,821 --> 01:04:35,562
If you keep complaining about him,

1052
01:04:35,587 --> 01:04:36,964
I won't forgive you, kid!

1053
01:04:39,076 --> 01:04:40,911
If you're a Jinchuriki,

1054
01:04:40,911 --> 01:04:45,541
you can imagine the kind of life
he's had to lead, can't you?

1055
01:04:45,916 --> 01:04:47,584
I sure can!

1056
01:04:47,829 --> 01:04:51,458
And that old man should be able
to imagine what it's like for me!

1057
01:04:52,216 --> 01:04:55,553
So why won't he give me
a break when I need his help?

1058
01:04:56,615 --> 01:04:57,616
Even I...

1059
01:05:03,767 --> 01:05:06,437
Bee has been watching
you all along.

1060
01:05:06,812 --> 01:05:08,647
There's a reason for his actions.

1061
01:05:09,982 --> 01:05:12,735
Did you introduce yourself to Bee?

1062
01:05:13,536 --> 01:05:17,289
We did... fist bumps.

1063
01:05:19,467 --> 01:05:22,470
Okay. Naruto, right? Follow me.

1064
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:26,540
I'll take you to
Bee's training spot.

1065
01:05:26,749 --> 01:05:28,083
All right!

1066
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:29,501
Then I'll join you.

1067
01:05:30,894 --> 01:05:32,020
Captain Yamato?!

1068
01:05:32,045 --> 01:05:34,381
I'm a Wood-Style user
and if something happens,

1069
01:05:34,381 --> 01:05:35,883
I'm supposed to look after him.

1070
01:05:37,217 --> 01:05:39,261
Oh? You're the Wood Style user.

1071
01:05:39,845 --> 01:05:40,846
Fine then.

1072
01:05:46,007 --> 01:05:47,217
Is this the place?

1073
01:05:47,727 --> 01:05:51,731
Yeah. This spot is known
as the Waterfall of Truth.

1074
01:05:52,050 --> 01:05:53,426
The Waterfall of Truth?

1075
01:05:54,276 --> 01:05:56,361
He learned to control
the Tailed Beast here?

1076
01:05:57,007 --> 01:05:59,093
No, it's the first step.

1077
01:06:01,366 --> 01:06:03,452
Sit here and close your eyes, Naruto.

1078
01:06:03,744 --> 01:06:06,246
You will see your true self.

1079
01:06:06,705 --> 01:06:08,457
My true self?

1080
01:06:08,749 --> 01:06:09,750
Yes.

1081
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:31,104
<i>Why?</i>

1082
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:35,510
<i>Why didn't you give them
your autograph at Ichiraku?</i>

1083
01:06:36,902 --> 01:06:37,945
What?

1084
01:06:38,431 --> 01:06:42,209
<i>Those guys suddenly got nice</i>

1085
01:06:42,387 --> 01:06:45,098
<i>and tried to get friendly
with you, huh?</i>

1086
01:06:48,413 --> 01:06:51,124
<i>They were disgusting, weren't they?</i>

1087
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:54,127
<i>This guy looks just like me!</i>

1088
01:06:54,753 --> 01:07:01,134
<i>Everyone in the village used
to treat us like lepers.</i>

1089
01:07:03,247 --> 01:07:04,526
Who are you?

1090
01:07:05,347 --> 01:07:08,600
<i>Can't you tell? I'm you.</i>

1091
01:07:09,726 --> 01:07:12,729
I don't remember doing
Shadow Clones.

1092
01:07:13,021 --> 01:07:15,315
<i>I'm the real you.</i>

1093
01:07:15,601 --> 01:07:19,695
<i>The real you that exists
deep inside your heart.</i>

1094
01:07:19,987 --> 01:07:21,488
What are you saying?!

1095
01:07:21,530 --> 01:07:25,492
I don't know you.
Stop making stuff up!

1096
01:07:25,826 --> 01:07:29,121
<i>This place is called
the Waterfall of Truth, right?</i>

1097
01:07:30,455 --> 01:07:33,333
<i>I never figured I'd be able
to come out like this.</i>

1098
01:07:33,792 --> 01:07:35,335
<i>What a great place.</i>

1099
01:07:36,848 --> 01:07:40,226
<i>Anyway, I'm your true self.</i>

1100
01:07:40,845 --> 01:07:43,098
<i>The real you.</i>

1101
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:45,721
The real me?

1102
01:07:46,388 --> 01:07:50,642
<i>Yeah. I'm the precious hatred
inside you.</i>

1103
01:07:50,684 --> 01:07:52,060
<i>The dark part of you!</i>

1104
01:07:54,062 --> 01:07:56,148
<i>The only difference is...</i>

1105
01:07:57,566 --> 01:08:01,570
<i>the Nine-Tails has taken
a real liking to me.</i>

1106
01:08:02,321 --> 01:08:03,322
You...

1107
01:08:04,114 --> 01:08:07,159
The Nine-Tails' will is
a mass of hatred

1108
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:10,120
that binds itself tightly to chakra.

1109
01:08:10,482 --> 01:08:12,833
No matter how hard you
try to shield yourself,

1110
01:08:12,858 --> 01:08:15,402
it will find some hatred that
you have buried deep inside

1111
01:08:15,427 --> 01:08:17,429
and try to take you over.

1112
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:21,089
<i>Until now, the Nine-Tails
and this guy...</i>

1113
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:22,883
<i>You got that right.</i>

1114
01:08:23,325 --> 01:08:28,246
<i>I'm the real one.
You can't kick me out, you fake!</i>

1115
01:08:29,121 --> 01:08:30,664
Is that how it is?

1116
01:08:40,359 --> 01:08:42,819
You're the fake one!

1117
01:08:52,496 --> 01:08:55,040
On this island, I'm top dog.

1118
01:08:55,082 --> 01:08:57,876
Taking y'all down
Like a whirlwind clearing the fog.

1119
01:08:58,543 --> 01:09:01,254
You still have a ways
to go, Kintoki.

1120
01:09:04,716 --> 01:09:05,926
<i>Hey Bee...</i>

1121
01:09:06,147 --> 01:09:07,743
<i>If you have time to play around,</i>

1122
01:09:07,768 --> 01:09:10,395
<i>why couldn't you have taken
a look at the Nine-Tails' kid?</i>

1123
01:09:10,753 --> 01:09:14,548
<i>You're both Jinchuriki,
why not give him a break?</i>

1124
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:19,406
<i>I don't like Nine-Tails myself,
but that kid has promise.</i>

1125
01:09:20,375 --> 01:09:22,460
<i>I was a confused mess back then,</i>

1126
01:09:22,762 --> 01:09:24,680
<i>but I met you and
look at me now.</i>

1127
01:09:24,903 --> 01:09:27,185
<i>He sort of reminds me of you.</i>

1128
01:09:27,210 --> 01:09:28,962
My style is rap
And I say shut yer trap!

1129
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:32,786
I ain't acknowledgin' no rap-mockin'
"Ya know" fool!

1130
01:09:33,585 --> 01:09:35,211
Besides, he...

1131
01:09:43,212 --> 01:09:44,338
Damn it!

1132
01:09:45,441 --> 01:09:47,317
<i>Our strength is identical.</i>

1133
01:09:47,579 --> 01:09:49,665
<i>There's no end to fighting him.</i>

1134
01:09:50,062 --> 01:09:54,024
<i>You can't beat me. Never.</i>

1135
01:09:56,379 --> 01:09:58,298
Then I'll put my bet on numbers!

1136
01:09:58,895 --> 01:10:00,480
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

1137
01:10:03,338 --> 01:10:04,923
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

1138
01:10:07,237 --> 01:10:09,614
What the hell?!
Is that how it is?!

1139
01:10:09,812 --> 01:10:12,492
Even the number of
Shadow Clones is the same!

1140
01:10:12,909 --> 01:10:15,454
<i>You're pretty smart,
figuring that out.</i>

1141
01:10:15,673 --> 01:10:17,174
Damn it!

1142
01:10:18,094 --> 01:10:19,304
Go!

1143
01:10:20,083 --> 01:10:21,251
<i>Go!</i>

1144
01:10:22,669 --> 01:10:24,838
What is going on?

1145
01:10:25,213 --> 01:10:27,716
When you sit before
the waterfall and focus,

1146
01:10:28,008 --> 01:10:30,802
you are able to enter
your subconscious.

1147
01:10:31,198 --> 01:10:35,584
And the waterfall becomes the
mirror that reflects your true self.

1148
01:10:35,994 --> 01:10:37,412
It is really a mystical place.

1149
01:10:39,115 --> 01:10:42,953
Right now, Naruto is battling
his other self.

1150
01:10:53,654 --> 01:10:55,072
– <i>Rasen...</i>
– <i>... gan!</i>

1151
01:11:05,618 --> 01:11:07,453
Naruto, are you all right?!

1152
01:11:08,221 --> 01:11:09,305
What happened?

1153
01:11:10,092 --> 01:11:13,095
Someone exactly like me appeared.

1154
01:11:13,945 --> 01:11:15,030
And he...

1155
01:11:15,722 --> 01:11:16,723
What is it?

1156
01:11:17,709 --> 01:11:19,794
He was my dark self.

1157
01:11:23,188 --> 01:11:24,815
We're evenly matched and

1158
01:11:24,944 --> 01:11:27,405
he keeps attacking with
the same strength as me.

1159
01:11:27,734 --> 01:11:31,571
Our jutsu, our fighting style,
everything is identical.

1160
01:11:31,613 --> 01:11:33,198
It's an endless battle!

1161
01:11:34,616 --> 01:11:35,867
How can that be?

1162
01:11:36,424 --> 01:11:38,022
You must defeat him

1163
01:11:38,047 --> 01:11:40,425
or you will not be able to control
the Tailed Beast's power.

1164
01:11:42,249 --> 01:11:43,500
I told you.

1165
01:11:44,036 --> 01:11:47,122
The Waterfall of Truth
is just the first step.

1166
01:11:51,258 --> 01:11:53,385
How am I supposed to
beat that guy?

1167
01:11:53,969 --> 01:11:56,805
Well that, I do not know.

1168
01:11:57,639 --> 01:12:00,225
Octopops trained here too, right?

1169
01:12:00,642 --> 01:12:02,352
I can ask him...

1170
01:12:04,312 --> 01:12:06,690
No, he won't tell me.

1171
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:08,233
Not with that attitude.

1172
01:12:08,733 --> 01:12:09,734
Probably not.

1173
01:12:11,069 --> 01:12:14,072
<i>I wonder if Octopops had
a dark half too?</i>

1174
01:12:16,283 --> 01:12:17,576
Hey, Mr. Motoi...

1175
01:12:19,286 --> 01:12:22,789
Can you tell me
more about Octopops?

1176
01:12:23,081 --> 01:12:26,293
Like how he grew up,
and his personality.

1177
01:12:26,334 --> 01:12:28,837
Maybe I can get some hints from that.

1178
01:12:30,088 --> 01:12:34,301
Maybe I can figure out
the difference between us.

1179
01:12:35,844 --> 01:12:39,139
I don't like talking about other people.

1180
01:12:40,932 --> 01:12:45,270
But Naruto, you're a Jinchuriki
just like Master Bee.

1181
01:12:46,688 --> 01:12:49,691
Being able to control the Nine-Tails
has a direct effect on world peace.

1182
01:12:50,984 --> 01:12:51,985
I'll do it.

1183
01:12:51,985 --> 01:12:53,486
Thank you!

1184
01:12:54,988 --> 01:12:56,448
I told you earlier...

1185
01:12:57,073 --> 01:12:58,617
Since you're also a Jinchuriki,

1186
01:12:58,617 --> 01:13:02,329
you can imagine
the kind of life he's had.

1187
01:13:05,290 --> 01:13:06,791
And it's just as you
would imagine...

1188
01:13:07,834 --> 01:13:11,713
Formidable power breeds
fear and antagonism.

1189
01:13:12,589 --> 01:13:17,535
Bee has always been shunned and
considered a nuisance by the villagers.

1190
01:13:18,386 --> 01:13:22,015
But he never got depressed
or complained even once.

1191
01:13:22,766 --> 01:13:24,851
He was always cheerful...

1192
01:13:24,893 --> 01:13:26,895
always trying to engage
with the people around him.

1193
01:13:27,687 --> 01:13:28,681
More than anything,

1194
01:13:28,706 --> 01:13:31,250
instead of being ashamed
that he was a Jinchuriki,

1195
01:13:31,441 --> 01:13:33,235
he didn't hide that fact.

1196
01:13:33,652 --> 01:13:38,198
To me, he seemed to
take pride in himself.

1197
01:13:40,059 --> 01:13:40,921
Yo.

1198
01:13:41,618 --> 01:13:45,622
The reason he was able to
take pride in being a Jinchuriki...

1199
01:13:46,957 --> 01:13:51,211
was probably because of
his older brother, the Raikage.

1200
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:56,132
From days past,
in order to prevent betrayal,

1201
01:13:56,341 --> 01:13:59,636
Jinchuriki have commonly been
selected from close blood relations

1202
01:13:59,885 --> 01:14:03,210
of the Five Kage like siblings,
or even spouses.

1203
01:14:04,474 --> 01:14:07,060
A Jinchuriki is a weapon used
to protect the Kage,

1204
01:14:07,102 --> 01:14:08,478
the head of the village.

1205
01:14:08,728 --> 01:14:11,147
It is also a symbol of
the Kage's strength.

1206
01:14:12,482 --> 01:14:15,110
I think Master Bee tried to be
a fine Jinchuriki

1207
01:14:15,151 --> 01:14:17,320
for Lord Raikage's sake.

1208
01:14:19,808 --> 01:14:22,008
It's said that he mastered
his training

1209
01:14:22,033 --> 01:14:23,868
at the Waterfall of Truth in no time.

1210
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:30,301
I deeply respect
the kind of person Master Bee is.

1211
01:14:31,459 --> 01:14:34,421
I consider him to be one of
the heroes of the Hidden Cloud.

1212
01:14:35,255 --> 01:14:37,674
Such a well-loved Jinchuriki.

1213
01:14:38,341 --> 01:14:42,554
Master Bee must be quite a person.
And you too.

1214
01:14:45,056 --> 01:14:46,099
I know!

1215
01:14:46,141 --> 01:14:52,314
Can you ask Octopops for
training hints on my behalf, Motoi?

1216
01:14:52,605 --> 01:14:54,524
I can't do that.

1217
01:14:54,566 --> 01:14:56,651
Why not?!

1218
01:14:57,569 --> 01:15:00,155
I have no right to request
such a thing.

1219
01:15:02,782 --> 01:15:06,453
I once tried to kill Master Bee!

1220
01:15:08,121 --> 01:15:12,125
Why?! You just said
you respected Octopops.

1221
01:15:16,463 --> 01:15:18,506
You seem to have a reason.

1222
01:15:21,509 --> 01:15:22,969
So what is it?

1223
01:15:24,262 --> 01:15:25,680
This is a confession.

1224
01:15:27,807 --> 01:15:30,518
You're a Jinchuriki like Bee,

1225
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:33,112
so I think it's okay to tell you
about that incident.

1226
01:15:33,447 --> 01:15:36,006
This took place 30 years ago...

1227
01:15:51,456 --> 01:15:55,377
Back then, the Jinchuriki's power
was not strong enough

1228
01:15:55,418 --> 01:15:58,880
to completely control the Eight-Tails.

1229
01:15:59,839 --> 01:16:02,050
The Eight-Tails often went
on a rampage

1230
01:16:02,092 --> 01:16:03,968
and wreaked havoc
on the Hidden Cloud.

1231
01:16:04,969 --> 01:16:08,390
Every time that happened,
the Third Raikage...

1232
01:16:08,504 --> 01:16:10,381
and his elite shinobi would
stop the Eight-Tails.

1233
01:16:12,268 --> 01:16:15,563
Listen! I want you to stop
the Eight-Tails' movements.

1234
01:16:15,647 --> 01:16:19,359
While you're doing that, I will
seal him in the Sealing Urn.

1235
01:16:19,401 --> 01:16:20,360
Understood.

1236
01:16:20,675 --> 01:16:22,302
Okay, get to it.

1237
01:16:51,942 --> 01:16:54,569
Damn it! The chain forged
from the Sealing Jutsu...

1238
01:16:54,769 --> 01:16:55,895
Don't give up!

1239
01:16:55,937 --> 01:16:58,690
If we give up, Hidden Cloud Village
will be destroyed.

1240
01:17:06,114 --> 01:17:07,407
All right, this should...

1241
01:17:24,257 --> 01:17:26,384
Now! Pin him down!

1242
01:17:32,724 --> 01:17:35,185
<i>Don't mess with me,
lowly humans!</i>

1243
01:18:16,649 --> 01:18:18,986
They were somehow able to suppress
the Eight-Tails' rampages

1244
01:18:19,011 --> 01:18:21,951
and shove him back into
the Sealing Urn.

1245
01:18:22,482 --> 01:18:24,484
But there were fatalities each time.

1246
01:18:25,493 --> 01:18:27,036
However, despite the risk,

1247
01:18:27,153 --> 01:18:29,864
it was crucial to control
the Eight-Tails

1248
01:18:30,105 --> 01:18:32,768
in order to preserve
the power balance between nations.

1249
01:18:33,993 --> 01:18:36,663
Experiments continued
with the Jinchuriki.

1250
01:18:41,084 --> 01:18:43,795
Among the many who died or
were injured...

1251
01:18:53,555 --> 01:18:55,306
was my father.

1252
01:18:59,894 --> 01:19:01,980
Master Bee killed your father.

1253
01:19:02,939 --> 01:19:03,815
That's why...

1254
01:19:03,856 --> 01:19:04,983
No, that wasn't it.

1255
01:19:07,402 --> 01:19:09,404
Master Bee and I
used to be friends.

1256
01:19:11,942 --> 01:19:15,654
We were only five years old
when my father died.

1257
01:19:24,544 --> 01:19:25,545
Bee, you did it!

1258
01:19:40,441 --> 01:19:43,319
The Jinchuriki that killed
my father died

1259
01:19:43,344 --> 01:19:45,889
when the Eight-Tails was
extracted and sealed.

1260
01:19:46,363 --> 01:19:48,073
It was the previous Jinchuriki.

1261
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:20,558
Right after that,

1262
01:20:20,558 --> 01:20:24,103
Master Bee was chosen to be
the Eight-Tails' Jinchuriki.

1263
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:28,191
So why did you try to kill Bee?

1264
01:20:28,816 --> 01:20:32,028
There is no way to control
the Eight-Tails.

1265
01:20:33,613 --> 01:20:35,657
There would be many more victims.

1266
01:20:36,491 --> 01:20:37,575
That's what I thought.

1267
01:20:52,758 --> 01:20:56,429
My hatred towards
the Eight-Tails grew.

1268
01:20:56,891 --> 01:20:58,309
I was just a kid,

1269
01:20:58,334 --> 01:21:01,337
but I kept thinking
about getting revenge.

1270
01:21:41,947 --> 01:21:44,741
Master Bee was always laughing.

1271
01:21:49,859 --> 01:21:54,430
I started hating him more and more
because it seemed like he didn't care.

1272
01:21:55,862 --> 01:22:00,616
My hatred of the Eight-Tails
shifted to Master Bee, his Jinchuriki.

1273
01:22:02,693 --> 01:22:07,656
I thought if I killed Master Bee,
the Eight-Tails would also die.

1274
01:22:43,983 --> 01:22:47,236
I attacked Master Bee from behind.

1275
01:22:48,091 --> 01:22:52,429
But I failed and
ran away scared.

1276
01:22:53,512 --> 01:22:56,223
My face was masked,

1277
01:22:56,297 --> 01:22:59,091
but Master Bee might
have guessed it was me.

1278
01:23:00,577 --> 01:23:03,955
After that, I stopped talking
to Master Bee.

1279
01:23:04,889 --> 01:23:06,432
Even after all that,

1280
01:23:06,474 --> 01:23:09,143
how did you come to
respect Master Bee?

1281
01:23:10,312 --> 01:23:12,523
My hatred didn't
disappear overnight.

1282
01:23:13,481 --> 01:23:14,941
For a long time,

1283
01:23:14,982 --> 01:23:18,236
I continued to stalk Master Bee
and kept an eye on him.

1284
01:23:19,111 --> 01:23:21,656
But I wasn't the only one.

1285
01:23:24,242 --> 01:23:28,287
Master Bee was shunned
by the villagers and despised.

1286
01:23:29,914 --> 01:23:30,915
All the time.

1287
01:23:46,556 --> 01:23:48,516
<i>Get lost! You're disgusting!</i>

1288
01:23:49,356 --> 01:23:52,693
Even though he was forced to become
a Jinchuriki for political reasons,

1289
01:23:52,854 --> 01:23:56,440
in order to protect the village,

1290
01:23:56,482 --> 01:23:58,901
people still ostracized him.

1291
01:24:02,238 --> 01:24:03,489
Oh yeah?

1292
01:24:03,489 --> 01:24:09,892
Yo yo yo, check it out, yo!
Hey, yo yo, hey c'mon, yo yo!!

1293
01:24:09,917 --> 01:24:13,212
Check it out, yo!
Yo, hey, yo yo!

1294
01:24:20,007 --> 01:24:22,343
Anyone else would have gone insane.

1295
01:24:23,092 --> 01:24:24,802
And for the first time...

1296
01:24:24,844 --> 01:24:26,429
I realized that
Master Bee's suffering

1297
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:27,847
was even greater than mine.

1298
01:24:29,599 --> 01:24:30,808
Why did you tell us?

1299
01:24:31,684 --> 01:24:34,896
Truth be told, I'd rather have
Master Bee hear this,

1300
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:41,986
but I think I'm telling Naruto
because he is a fellow Jinchuriki.

1301
01:24:43,652 --> 01:24:48,157
I know that I owe it to Bee to
tell him the truth some day.

1302
01:24:49,263 --> 01:24:51,590
Otherwise, it wouldn't be
a confession.

1303
01:24:56,028 --> 01:24:58,030
<i>How convenient for him.</i>

1304
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,510
Naruto, where are you going?

1305
01:25:07,994 --> 01:25:10,663
I need to be alone for a while!

1306
01:25:26,238 --> 01:25:27,615
<i>It's that boy...</i>

1307
01:25:27,907 --> 01:25:29,575
<i>Remember, stay away from him!</i>

1308
01:25:29,867 --> 01:25:30,868
<i>Go away!</i>

1309
01:25:34,511 --> 01:25:37,556
<i>I believed in you!
You're a hero, Naruto!</i>

1310
01:25:39,251 --> 01:25:40,544
<i>Thank you, Naruto!</i>

1311
01:25:42,254 --> 01:25:43,339
<i>To them,</i>

1312
01:25:43,364 --> 01:25:48,702
<i>I am now a relic of the past
that is difficult to get rid of.</i>

1313
01:25:49,131 --> 01:25:51,049
<i>Gaara is the Kazekage, you know.</i>

1314
01:25:52,925 --> 01:25:54,844
<i>Don't be so disrespectful!</i>

1315
01:25:54,938 --> 01:25:56,231
<i>You're nothing but subordinates!</i>

1316
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:01,137
<i>Gaara is reserved, cool, strong,
handsome, an elite, and...</i>

1317
01:26:02,733 --> 01:26:06,779
<i>Octopops has earned so much trust.</i>

1318
01:26:07,738 --> 01:26:09,907
<i>And Gaara has become
the Kazekage,</i>

1319
01:26:09,949 --> 01:26:14,286
<i>working for the sake of his village
and gaining acceptance.</i>

1320
01:26:16,253 --> 01:26:20,048
<i>And me, I have Iruka-sensei
and my comrades and...</i>

1321
01:26:20,459 --> 01:26:26,549
<i>The villagers treated us
like outcasts, but now...</i>

1322
01:26:27,591 --> 01:26:32,096
<i>I am the real you that exists
deep inside your heart.</i>

1323
01:26:32,388 --> 01:26:33,848
<i>I am the real you.</i>

1324
01:26:34,631 --> 01:26:35,883
<i>The real me.</i>

1325
01:26:36,559 --> 01:26:38,477
<i>I never even gave it a thought.</i>

1326
01:26:39,445 --> 01:26:41,572
<i>But somewhere deep inside,
I'm still...</i>

1327
01:26:44,743 --> 01:26:45,744
<i>It's true.</i>

1328
01:26:46,652 --> 01:26:50,781
<i>I'm still not confident that I have
everyone's trust in the village.</i>

1329
01:27:01,292 --> 01:27:02,835
Where did Naruto go?

1330
01:27:04,273 --> 01:27:05,399
Don't tell me...

1331
01:27:05,501 --> 01:27:07,169
The location of this island
is top secret.

1332
01:27:07,465 --> 01:27:08,841
There's no way an enemy would...

1333
01:27:10,342 --> 01:27:12,636
That was old man Motoi.

1334
01:27:20,227 --> 01:27:21,270
Damn it!

1335
01:27:25,067 --> 01:27:27,403
Naruto! We're going to go
with Formation C!

1336
01:27:28,152 --> 01:27:30,237
Why... Why?

1337
01:27:30,679 --> 01:27:32,389
Naruto! What are you doing?!

1338
01:27:32,615 --> 01:27:35,284
Stop, Octopops!

1339
01:27:35,868 --> 01:27:40,998
Old man Motoi really trusts you!

1340
01:27:41,457 --> 01:27:42,541
It's a squid!

1341
01:27:42,750 --> 01:27:44,460
That's not an octopus!
It's a squid!

1342
01:27:46,378 --> 01:27:47,922
Naruto! Save the talking for later!

1343
01:27:48,023 --> 01:27:49,024
Let's do this!

1344
01:27:49,164 --> 01:27:50,165
Gotcha!

1345
01:27:50,327 --> 01:27:52,830
<i>Wood Style: Silent Strangle Jutsu!</i>

1346
01:27:59,324 --> 01:28:00,617
Old man Motoi!

1347
01:28:00,833 --> 01:28:02,251
We're coming to get you!

1348
01:28:03,823 --> 01:28:05,325
<i>I'll tell you how I feel...</i>

1349
01:28:05,421 --> 01:28:07,048
<i>I'm going to save you for real.</i>

1350
01:28:07,249 --> 01:28:08,584
<i>That's my deal...</i>

1351
01:28:08,609 --> 01:28:10,069
<i>That's my spiel.</i>

1352
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:13,046
<i>Eight-Tails and me retake the stage!</i>

1353
01:28:13,235 --> 01:28:15,863
<i>Knocking the beat-up squid
right off the page!</i>

1354
01:28:15,908 --> 01:28:17,326
<i>The rest, I won't engage.</i>

1355
01:28:26,484 --> 01:28:27,651
Octopops!

1356
01:28:36,958 --> 01:28:39,294
Bee, why did you save me?

1357
01:28:42,123 --> 01:28:44,331
Master Bee, you knew, didn't you?

1358
01:28:44,416 --> 01:28:45,751
That I tried to...

1359
01:28:52,882 --> 01:28:55,549
I tried to kill you.

1360
01:28:58,784 --> 01:28:59,785
And yet...

1361
01:29:04,524 --> 01:29:06,484
Did that happen?

1362
01:29:08,622 --> 01:29:10,165
What I remember is...

1363
01:29:11,213 --> 01:29:12,381
Me and Motoi...

1364
01:29:12,381 --> 01:29:13,591
Me and Motoi.

1365
01:29:13,591 --> 01:29:16,010
The times I spent
with Motoi, together...

1366
01:29:16,035 --> 01:29:17,829
We trained hard like
birds of a feather,

1367
01:29:17,854 --> 01:29:19,772
We made mistakes
but it was no disaster...

1368
01:29:19,847 --> 01:29:21,015
The two of us always exploding
into laughter.

1369
01:29:21,056 --> 01:29:23,767
The two of us laughing,
best friends forever...

1370
01:29:23,934 --> 01:29:26,520
The times I spent
with Motoi, together.

1371
01:29:42,119 --> 01:29:43,162
Yay!

1372
01:30:02,181 --> 01:30:06,227
Hey, Nine-Tails' brat,
thanks for trying to save Motoi.

1373
01:30:06,685 --> 01:30:07,686
Sure.

1374
01:30:08,604 --> 01:30:12,066
Naruto has the ability to
bring people together.

1375
01:30:12,816 --> 01:30:14,568
Just like Bee.

1376
01:30:15,986 --> 01:30:18,405
Yes! I totally agree!

1377
01:30:18,906 --> 01:30:21,533
I think I need to
reconsider ya mate.

1378
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:24,370
You're quite a good guy,
real top rate.

1379
01:30:24,578 --> 01:30:26,914
Octopops,
ya got the best rap...

1380
01:30:27,206 --> 01:30:29,667
I'm so happy to know ya,
I'm one lucky chap!

1381
01:30:30,834 --> 01:30:33,671
<i>It's great that Naruto and
Bee share similar traits.</i>

1382
01:30:34,630 --> 01:30:38,050
<i>But frankly, I wish he'd stop
copying his rapping.</i>

1383
01:30:38,467 --> 01:30:40,386
Yo! Keep the beat.

1384
01:30:44,807 --> 01:30:47,559
Yo! I'm Naruto, ya know!

1385
01:30:49,895 --> 01:30:51,188
All right, it's decided!

1386
01:30:54,483 --> 01:30:58,237
Man, it's "ya know, ya know"
all the time.

1387
01:30:59,321 --> 01:31:01,156
Shuddup, ya know!

1388
01:31:05,452 --> 01:31:06,912
Go to the Waterfall of Truth.

1389
01:31:07,538 --> 01:31:09,790
You'll pass with flying colors now.

1390
01:31:45,948 --> 01:31:48,284
<i>So have you come back because you
haven't learned your lesson yet?</i>

1391
01:31:48,499 --> 01:31:50,876
<i>It's going to be the same,
no matter how many times you try.</i>

1392
01:31:51,123 --> 01:31:53,208
<i>You cannot beat me.</i>

1393
01:31:55,836 --> 01:31:56,837
I know.

1394
01:31:58,302 --> 01:32:01,431
Trying to defeat you
with force isn't going to work.

1395
01:32:02,431 --> 01:32:04,767
Because we use
the exact same moves.

1396
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:08,609
<i>You won't be able to
chase me out either.</i>

1397
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:13,550
<i>I know you better than anyone else.</i>

1398
01:32:15,666 --> 01:32:16,523
Then...

1399
01:32:17,137 --> 01:32:18,972
You already know...

1400
01:32:21,046 --> 01:32:22,297
<i>What do you want to say?</i>

1401
01:32:23,874 --> 01:32:25,501
What I decided earlier.

1402
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:29,901
<i>I don't remember.</i>

1403
01:32:31,656 --> 01:32:33,366
Don't act like you don't know.

1404
01:32:34,201 --> 01:32:35,202
Well, never mind.

1405
01:32:35,751 --> 01:32:39,880
This place is supposed to show
the truth in your heart,

1406
01:32:39,922 --> 01:32:43,300
so I'll concentrate on the image
and show it directly to you.

1407
01:32:54,649 --> 01:32:56,443
This is my autograph.

1408
01:32:58,315 --> 01:32:59,358
<i>Why you!</i>

1409
01:33:05,197 --> 01:33:07,408
<i>Oh hey! Give me
your autograph, Naruto!</i>

1410
01:33:08,033 --> 01:33:11,912
<i>Could you make it out to my kid?
He's a big fan of yours.</i>

1411
01:33:13,122 --> 01:33:14,123
<i>An autograph?</i>

1412
01:33:14,598 --> 01:33:16,016
<i>The hero of the Hidden Leaf.</i>

1413
01:33:16,136 --> 01:33:18,680
<i>The youth who created a miracle,
Naruto Uzumaki.</i>

1414
01:33:20,337 --> 01:33:21,839
<i>Give me your autograph too!</i>

1415
01:33:22,297 --> 01:33:23,549
<i>What is it? You refuse?</i>

1416
01:33:23,961 --> 01:33:27,631
<i>Oh no, but I'm not used to
that sort of thing.</i>

1417
01:33:27,845 --> 01:33:29,596
<i>I don't have a clue
what to sign.</i>

1418
01:33:31,370 --> 01:33:34,410
Back at Ichiraku, I couldn't give
them their autographs.

1419
01:33:34,435 --> 01:33:36,353
Here it is now.

1420
01:33:40,149 --> 01:33:42,317
<i>Who cares if you have it now?</i>

1421
01:33:42,724 --> 01:33:43,725
<i>What a joke!</i>

1422
01:33:44,060 --> 01:33:45,963
<i>Everyone in the village is
just sucking up to you.</i>

1423
01:33:45,988 --> 01:33:47,614
<i>They don't mean it.</i>

1424
01:33:47,906 --> 01:33:51,285
<i>They've been lying to us
the whole time.</i>

1425
01:33:51,452 --> 01:33:54,037
<i>Making up rules and
treating us like outcasts!</i>

1426
01:33:54,284 --> 01:33:55,493
<i>Don't you remember?</i>

1427
01:33:55,747 --> 01:33:59,877
<i>It was so hard and painful.</i>

1428
01:34:00,544 --> 01:34:02,921
<i>I'm the only one who will
ever understand you!</i>

1429
01:34:03,329 --> 01:34:05,164
<i>Don't trust anyone
from the village!</i>

1430
01:34:07,634 --> 01:34:08,635
Yeah...

1431
01:34:09,428 --> 01:34:11,263
The villagers are important,

1432
01:34:12,354 --> 01:34:15,149
but there's someone else
I have to trust first.

1433
01:34:17,708 --> 01:34:20,419
I have to believe in myself.

1434
01:34:20,939 --> 01:34:24,276
I need to trust the version of me that
the villagers believe in.

1435
01:34:38,064 --> 01:34:39,065
<i>Why?</i>

1436
01:34:41,244 --> 01:34:45,540
<i>After all that
they put us through?</i>

1437
01:34:46,499 --> 01:34:48,627
Octopops made me
realize something.

1438
01:34:49,828 --> 01:34:55,334
He doesn't doubt himself at all.
He has pride in himself.

1439
01:34:56,698 --> 01:34:57,741
<i>Do you...</i>

1440
01:34:59,443 --> 01:35:01,362
<i>Do you consider me a burden?</i>

1441
01:35:01,535 --> 01:35:03,787
<i>Just what am I to you?</i>

1442
01:35:04,255 --> 01:35:06,966
Because you existed,
I became strong.

1443
01:35:08,278 --> 01:35:10,197
Thanks to you,
I've made it this far.

1444
01:35:11,064 --> 01:35:12,065
<i>And?</i>

1445
01:35:12,860 --> 01:35:13,861
<i>And what am I...</i>

1446
01:35:15,161 --> 01:35:17,455
<i>And what am I
supposed to do now?</i>

1447
01:35:17,874 --> 01:35:19,751
That's simple.

1448
01:35:25,462 --> 01:35:27,047
You just become me.

1449
01:35:27,776 --> 01:35:29,194
Since you are me.

1450
01:35:33,524 --> 01:35:35,429
Thanks for everything until today.

1451
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:38,429
But it's going to be all right now.

1452
01:36:38,201 --> 01:36:38,869
It seems...

1453
01:36:39,052 --> 01:36:40,220
... it all went well?

1454
01:36:40,318 --> 01:36:44,489
It's too soon to celebrate,
fool, ya fool.

1455
01:36:49,510 --> 01:36:53,347
Shall we try to control
the Nine-Tails' power now?

1456
01:36:54,505 --> 01:36:56,882
From this moment,
I'll be your Master!

1457
01:36:56,972 --> 01:36:59,767
Better steel yourself,
or face disaster!

1458
01:37:01,039 --> 01:37:02,248
All right!

1459
01:37:02,862 --> 01:37:04,656
Come with me, Naruto!

1460
01:37:05,673 --> 01:37:08,009
Excuse me...
Do you mind if I join?

1461
01:37:08,357 --> 01:37:09,399
Okay!

1462
01:37:10,192 --> 01:37:11,193
What about Motoi?

1463
01:37:11,485 --> 01:37:14,392
I have to report in to the Hidden Cloud
at regular intervals,

1464
01:37:14,417 --> 01:37:15,808
so I'll take my leave here.

1465
01:37:16,073 --> 01:37:17,279
Thank you for your help.

1466
01:37:19,159 --> 01:37:22,371
Things won't be easy
from here on out.

1467
01:37:25,215 --> 01:37:27,509
So there was something on
the other side of the waterfall.

1468
01:37:40,013 --> 01:37:41,473
Wow!

1469
01:37:42,113 --> 01:37:44,073
You'll fight the Nine-Tails here!

1470
01:37:45,107 --> 01:37:46,609
Fight the Nine-Tails?

1471
01:37:47,460 --> 01:37:50,213
That's right, fool, ya fool.
