1
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:10,719
You're finally going out.

2
00:00:11,771 --> 00:00:14,774
Well, there have been
a lot of changes to our plans.

3
00:00:16,732 --> 00:00:20,820
I wish you wouldn't say it
like I'm to blame.

4
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:24,661
<i>Thanks to you,
we had to change our strategy.</i>

5
00:00:25,697 --> 00:00:27,032
Thanks to me,

6
00:00:27,057 --> 00:00:31,770
your military strength and strategic
options have increased, haven't they?

7
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:36,661
Don't do anything strange
while I'm away.

8
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:42,141
We're comrades.
You should trust me more.

9
00:00:43,928 --> 00:00:47,723
You only look after
your own interests.

10
00:00:48,984 --> 00:00:51,987
You won't even tell me
where you're off to?

11
00:00:53,323 --> 00:00:54,879
The Hidden Rain Village.

12
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,098
The Hidden Rain?

13
00:00:57,666 --> 00:01:00,711
They're not even directly involved
in the Great Ninja War,

14
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,292
so why are you going now?

15
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,733
It doesn't concern you.

16
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:49,718
What?!

17
00:02:50,054 --> 00:02:53,140
Naruto's going through
harsh training like that?!

18
00:02:54,046 --> 00:02:57,360
I can't ignore a young man struggling
in the springtime of his youth!

19
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,470
Take me to Naruto!

20
00:03:00,528 --> 00:03:03,539
He... is a bit eccentric.

21
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:04,660
So I apologize.

22
00:03:04,842 --> 00:03:05,717
It's all right.

23
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,364
All right!

24
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,035
What happened?

25
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,120
Did it go well?

26
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,664
A lot of things happened.

27
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,251
Yo!

28
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:33,788
I see! I get it!
Understood!

29
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:36,398
Your expression now is looking good!

30
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,593
What about the Nine-Tails?

31
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,511
Did you get it under control?

32
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,639
That's real good news.

33
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,266
Especially when you used it,
in that situation, yo!

34
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:53,024
Whoa, Naruto!
Don't tell me that by that, you mean...

35
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,067
You know what?!

36
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,481
Yup!

37
00:03:55,741 --> 00:03:57,534
That's right, ya know!

38
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,990
So tell me what happened!

39
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,409
That's too abstract...
It makes no sense!

40
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:04,619
This is all on purpose!

41
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,788
You're talking like that on purpose!

42
00:04:06,908 --> 00:04:09,118
That much I know!

43
00:04:09,536 --> 00:04:11,872
Relax, Captain Yamato.

44
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,212
I have the Nine-Tails' chakra safe

45
00:04:14,237 --> 00:04:16,031
in a separate place inside me.

46
00:04:17,447 --> 00:04:19,283
So that I'm not using it all the time.

47
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:39,696
This is what it's like when I use
the Nine-Tails' chakra.

48
00:04:42,087 --> 00:04:43,130
Amazing...

49
00:04:43,382 --> 00:04:45,175
It's overflowing with life energy.

50
00:04:48,437 --> 00:04:50,689
I can't believe my Wood Style
is reacting to it.

51
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,044
What?

52
00:04:55,525 --> 00:04:56,547
You really think...

53
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,131
you're hidden?

54
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,634
Do you sense some other chakra?

55
00:05:02,282 --> 00:05:07,329
He actually sensed it... his presence.
I noticed nothing... I'm so dense!

56
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,517
<i>Impossible!</i>

57
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,790
<i>My chakra is the same as Samehada.</i>

58
00:05:12,815 --> 00:05:14,775
<i>There's no way
anyone could sense it!</i>

59
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,566
It's not chakra!

60
00:05:16,869 --> 00:05:20,081
It feels hazy... something sinister.

61
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,529
That's it! That thing!

62
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,573
The sword?

63
00:05:28,254 --> 00:05:32,758
It seems that you can sense hatred
and feelings of evil.

64
00:05:35,052 --> 00:05:38,097
The limitations of sensory-types
don't apply.

65
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,590
Is that the power of a Jinchuriki

66
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,217
who has mastery
over the Nine-Tails?

67
00:05:43,526 --> 00:05:46,445
You're the shark guy of the Akatsuki!

68
00:05:46,645 --> 00:05:49,940
How? I thought we cut
his head off a while back...

69
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:58,125
How did you manage to escape
our tag-team attack?

70
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:04,447
I simply switched places while we
battled inside the sphere of water.

71
00:06:12,312 --> 00:06:14,231
<i>Don't you think you're overdoing it?</i>

72
00:06:16,137 --> 00:06:19,057
<i>Don't you think that was
just right for the Eight-Tails?</i>

73
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,673
<i>I guess it's my turn now.</i>

74
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,722
<i>I leave it in your hands.</i>

75
00:06:32,858 --> 00:06:35,903
Clones disappear
when they're struck!

76
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,192
The corpse remained
post-mortem... no question.

77
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:42,235
And if someone else had
transformed into you,

78
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,388
Cee would have sensed it.

79
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,239
So it's a confusing situation.

80
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,866
It was a special kind of clone.

81
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,246
A Parasitic Clone that I can
manipulate remotely.

82
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:57,083
Anyway, enough about this subject.

83
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,920
Now then, two Jinchuriki
and a Wood Style user...

84
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:04,715
I am in a serious predicament.

85
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,135
What?

86
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,929
How did you know the way to
open the door to this room?!

87
00:07:13,507 --> 00:07:15,281
That's a silly question.

88
00:07:15,306 --> 00:07:19,227
I came here to spy.

89
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,113
That was Body Flicker Jutsu?

90
00:07:27,138 --> 00:07:28,848
The first smash...

91
00:07:28,873 --> 00:07:31,334
Just like the Yellow Flash!

92
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,681
<i>So fast... I didn't expect that.</i>

93
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,752
My foot!

94
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,630
I had so much force,
I hit it too hard!

95
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,717
It seems you're not up to
the Fourth Hokage's level yet.

96
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,550
Bee! Please go after him!

97
00:07:50,614 --> 00:07:51,662
I'll see to Naruto.

98
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:55,484
Right! Leave the chase to me.
I'll catch him in a jiffy.

99
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,482
What?

100
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:06,277
Your true self appears from
inside the waterfall?

101
00:08:07,003 --> 00:08:09,046
Is that for real?

102
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:13,159
Yes. Naruto faced and defeated
his true self at this very spot.

103
00:08:14,186 --> 00:08:15,979
Guy, why don't you try it out
for yourself?

104
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,663
Don't be stupid!

105
00:08:17,688 --> 00:08:20,900
We have to go and
help Naruto first!

106
00:08:21,031 --> 00:08:23,944
I came here as a teacher
to protect Naruto!

107
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:26,213
Don't get so upset.

108
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:30,885
Are you afraid to face
your true self?

109
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,470
Is that it?

110
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,138
What did you say?

111
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,433
You think I'm scared?

112
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,422
No problem!

113
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:44,405
No, I was just joking.

114
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:47,433
I have a feeling
your true self isn't human.

115
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,572
Don't take me so seriously.

116
00:08:58,722 --> 00:09:02,935
<i>Honestly, you really shouldn't be
going on about "youth," should you?</i>

117
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,129
<i>Overdoing things can hurt
a man past his prime like you.</i>

118
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,967
<i>I know you have to keep up
appearances for Lee's sake.</i>

119
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:16,097
<i>But no one expects you to
force yourself to stay youthful.</i>

120
00:09:16,568 --> 00:09:18,195
Show yourself!

121
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,976
You can say what you like
to my face!

122
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,018
<i>Fine.</i>

123
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,938
<i>You can take a long,
hard look at your true self.</i>

124
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,900
Is this my true self?!

125
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,527
An Odd Beast?

126
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,280
<i>I'm sure this is...
the Odd Beast!</i>

127
00:09:34,371 --> 00:09:36,289
Hey me! The one who has
forgotten what youth is!

128
00:09:36,378 --> 00:09:38,242
I'll beat some sense into you!

129
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,328
Guy!

130
00:09:39,683 --> 00:09:41,756
That's not your true self!

131
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,874
<i>Leaf Rock...</i>

132
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,918
<i>Crushing Square!</i>

133
00:09:52,711 --> 00:09:54,755
It's not my true self.

134
00:09:56,577 --> 00:09:58,084
Take a good look!

135
00:09:58,525 --> 00:10:00,193
It's not you,
no matter how you look at it!

136
00:10:00,638 --> 00:10:02,264
The moment you open your eyes,

137
00:10:02,289 --> 00:10:04,124
you leave the Waterfall of Truth!

138
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,901
This is... I'm certain it's...

139
00:10:13,854 --> 00:10:15,689
the fish they call puffer fish!

140
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,369
I see that you are still dumber
than a beast.

141
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,955
He's an Akatsuki agent!

142
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,749
If he escapes,
they'll get intel on us.

143
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,348
And that would be
a huge disgrace!

144
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,092
Damn you, Samehada...

145
00:10:39,301 --> 00:10:41,645
I see, I see... He forced you.

146
00:10:41,921 --> 00:10:44,841
That must've been pretty tough.

147
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:58,199
Hey, hey! Don't play too rough!

148
00:10:58,466 --> 00:11:01,345
But what can I say,
I got the right stuff!

149
00:11:06,278 --> 00:11:07,756
He's taking your chakra!

150
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,845
Guy! Please assist me!

151
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,764
I'm going to get data
from him instead!

152
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:23,551
<i>Secret Jutsu: Stone Needles!</i>

153
00:11:24,403 --> 00:11:25,404
All right!

154
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:29,355
<i>A jutsu where chakra is poured
in to stop my movement.</i>

155
00:11:29,503 --> 00:11:31,701
<i>Now that's perfect!</i>

156
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,070
<i>Is he absorbing my chakra instead?</i>

157
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,198
<i>So much pull!</i>

158
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,616
<i>Leaf Hurricane!</i>

159
00:11:42,232 --> 00:11:45,319
<i>I've gotten all my chakra back.</i>

160
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:46,914
<i>Water Style:</i>

161
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,582
<i>Shark Bomb Jutsu!</i>

162
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:54,949
Damn it, he got away!

163
00:11:58,676 --> 00:11:59,677
He's fast!

164
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,304
If he gets past the barrier
around this island, it's all over.

165
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:04,207
We must stop him before that,

166
00:12:04,232 --> 00:12:05,984
because my sensory powers
won't work then.

167
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,729
I'll stop him!

168
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,397
<i>The Eight Inner Gates!</i>

169
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:14,416
<i>The Sixth Gate of Joy: Open!</i>

170
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,969
Let yourself be captured by
the arms of my Eight-Tails...

171
00:12:16,994 --> 00:12:18,203
Odd Beast!

172
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,017
Far, far away you'll go...

173
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:23,002
In the direction of
ten o'clock I'll throw.

174
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,794
Don't sacrifice the truth just
for a rhyme!

175
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,621
He went towards two o'clock!

176
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,166
All right!

177
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,220
I'm counting on you!

178
00:12:43,656 --> 00:12:46,429
I was going to say it's been a while...
but really, midair?

179
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,001
I'm going to borrow your back!

180
00:12:59,616 --> 00:13:02,994
<i>Looks like I gave them the slip.</i>

181
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,076
<i>Summoning Jutsu...</i>

182
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,673
You're persistent!

183
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:23,803
So... That scroll you gave to that
shark contains intel on us.

184
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,638
I won't let you get away!

185
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:29,934
I wouldn't be so sure.
I have the geographical advantage.

186
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,730
<i>Water Style:
A Thousand Hungry Sharks!</i>

187
00:13:38,074 --> 00:13:40,660
<i>I don't know which shark is which.</i>

188
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:43,823
<i>In that case...!</i>

189
00:13:46,884 --> 00:13:48,427
<i>Asakujaku!</i>

190
00:14:01,902 --> 00:14:03,237
<i>Where's the scroll?</i>

191
00:14:04,113 --> 00:14:06,031
<i>Damn it.
There are too many of them.</i>

192
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,223
<i>It can't be helped.
I have to cover a wider area.</i>

193
00:14:16,087 --> 00:14:19,340
He won't let the sharks
in the water go either.

194
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,734
Fine.

195
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:23,279
I'll just let them tear you apart!

196
00:14:27,694 --> 00:14:28,986
<i>The Seventh Gate of Shock!</i>

197
00:14:29,194 --> 00:14:30,362
<i>Open!</i>

198
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,296
I see...

199
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:44,911
A taijutsu that crushes opponents
with a shock wave

200
00:14:44,936 --> 00:14:48,732
of air and flames created from
the friction of punched air!

201
00:14:48,757 --> 00:14:50,175
An Odd Beast indeed.

202
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:55,978
A shinobi with taijutsu
this powerful is truly rare.

203
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,606
This will be the third time for me.

204
00:14:59,126 --> 00:15:02,838
The next taijutsu will be nothing
like the previous ones.

205
00:15:03,323 --> 00:15:04,991
It's a special single-blow attack.

206
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,823
It's something you'll rarely see...

207
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:12,119
The blue chakra is pushing
the water away.

208
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:16,540
<i>Water Style:</i>

209
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,876
<i>Super Shark Bomb Jutsu!</i>

210
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,545
<i>Hirudora!</i>

211
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,893
<i>This Super Shark Bomb is
no ordinary jutsu.</i>

212
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:41,440
<i>The jutsu itself absorbs chakra
and becomes even stronger.</i>

213
00:15:42,002 --> 00:15:45,766
<i>And the stronger the opponent's
ninjutsu, The stronger it gets.</i>

214
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,031
What's going on?

215
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,034
I exhausted his jutsu...

216
00:15:52,717 --> 00:15:55,261
but my Super Shark Bomb
isn't getting stronger?!

217
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,957
I know I absorbed his chakra!

218
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:01,293
Was that not
a chakra Energy Bomb?!

219
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,963
Roar, my youth!

220
00:16:31,534 --> 00:16:32,687
What is that?

221
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,034
That's...

222
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:38,080
Guy's Eight Inner Gates attack...
Hirudora!

223
00:16:38,387 --> 00:16:41,598
Hirudora? That's a lame name
for a jutsu.

224
00:16:41,623 --> 00:16:45,000
Considering Guy-sensei's obsession
with youth.

225
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,677
There's no time to nitpick!

226
00:16:52,194 --> 00:16:55,280
The Hirudora has a wide blast radius,
and it hits instantly.

227
00:16:55,411 --> 00:16:56,442
Brace yourselves!

228
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,463
Don't move.

229
00:17:28,133 --> 00:17:29,927
That jutsu...

230
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,676
It wasn't an Energy Bomb, was it?

231
00:17:33,245 --> 00:17:35,789
And your blue aura...

232
00:17:36,673 --> 00:17:39,592
Hirudora is not
a chakra-based ninjutsu.

233
00:17:39,651 --> 00:17:40,970
It is taijutsu.

234
00:17:41,378 --> 00:17:45,257
It's just an ordinary punch,
but it's a super fast punch.

235
00:17:46,145 --> 00:17:49,523
A focused thrust of air pressure
right at your opponent.

236
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,985
That compresses
and spreads in an instant.

237
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:56,950
And this aura that envelops me
is not chakra...

238
00:17:57,801 --> 00:18:00,512
Those who open
the Seventh Gate of Shock,

239
00:18:00,683 --> 00:18:02,894
perspire blue sweat!

240
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,543
That is what's evaporating
from the heat of my passion!

241
00:18:07,538 --> 00:18:13,377
I thought that looked too small
to be an Energy Bomb.

242
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,404
This is my third time fighting you.

243
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,974
But you still had something
like this up your sleeve.

244
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:25,646
You probably don't remember me.

245
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,528
I thought I told you not to move.

246
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,459
I got to hand it to
Bushier Brow-sensei

247
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,919
for bringing this guy down!

248
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:52,384
If this goes well,
I'll be able to extract intel

249
00:18:52,578 --> 00:18:55,241
about Akatsuki and its plans,
as well as the identity of its leader.

250
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:58,769
I'm not as good as Inoichi,
but I'll give it a try.

251
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,290
Here I go.

252
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:09,732
<i>Now then...</i>

253
00:19:10,373 --> 00:19:12,291
<i>Here comes the hard part...</i>

254
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:33,922
Hoshigaki...

255
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,967
Won't you eat with us?

256
00:19:38,783 --> 00:19:42,078
There's no need to be nice to me.

257
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:45,993
Hey, you heard him.
Just leave him alone!

258
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:49,146
He doesn't like to rub shoulders
with Intel Division geeks like us.

259
00:19:54,483 --> 00:19:55,245
Run!

260
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,956
Surrender!
You're completely surrounded.

261
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,292
There's no way you can win.

262
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,045
I know you.

263
00:20:13,927 --> 00:20:15,856
You're that brilliant guy from

264
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,383
the Leaf ANBU's Torture and
Interrogation Corps...

265
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:20,427
Want to fight?

266
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:39,529
Now's our chance. Run!

267
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,879
Hoshigaki, what do we do?

268
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,005
Hoshigaki?

269
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,718
Wh-What are you doing?!

270
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,053
<i>However...</i>

271
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:06,622
<i>You must not allow any member of the
Cipher Corps to fall into enemy hands.</i>

272
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,599
<i>Your mission is to guard the code,
whatever it takes.</i>

273
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,690
<i>Do you understand
what that means?</i>

274
00:21:14,769 --> 00:21:15,770
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

275
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:19,945
<i>I shall not hand over any of
the Cipher Corps shinobi alive.</i>

276
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,536
Why?

277
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:33,542
Because killing my comrades
is my special mission.

278
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,757
What a terrible life...

279
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,815
Your comrades... why?

280
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,026
Why?

281
00:22:02,838 --> 00:22:04,673
You, of all people, should understand.

282
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:08,527
We cannot let our code fall
into enemy hands.

283
00:22:08,944 --> 00:22:11,614
Besides, they would have
talked right away.

284
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:16,361
If we both survive,
let's meet again.

285
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:26,803
Kisame... You...!

286
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,748
Good work, Kisame.

287
00:22:57,584 --> 00:23:00,332
I had a feeling he would let his guard
down with his subordinate.

288
00:23:00,452 --> 00:23:01,744
And I was right.

289
00:23:04,642 --> 00:23:06,686
He was collaborating
with the enemy.

290
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,304
From this moment on,

291
00:23:09,446 --> 00:23:11,698
you are the master of
the great blade, Samehada.

292
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,393
And my subordinate as well.

293
00:23:15,264 --> 00:23:20,644
That is, until you eliminate me too,
Lord Fourth Mizukage.

294
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,737
I can trust you because
of who you are.

295
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,574
You have executed dirty missions
for the sake of the nation and village.

296
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:33,002
You've undertaken missions
of betrayal.

297
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:37,427
You are well aware that this world
is full of lies and deceit.

298
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:42,406
I knew that from the first moment
I killed a comrade.

299
00:23:43,017 --> 00:23:46,646
Killing a Hidden Mist ninja
despite being one myself.

300
00:23:47,622 --> 00:23:50,166
So what am I?

301
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,639
Am I an enemy or an ally?

302
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,059
What is my purpose?
Where do I stand in this world?

303
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:01,106
Where must I go?
And where can I go to find inner calm?

304
00:24:02,937 --> 00:24:08,067
There is one thing that is clear to
me... I am trapped in a false existence.

305
00:24:12,676 --> 00:24:16,805
Then I shall release you from
the pain of those falsehoods.

306
00:24:17,362 --> 00:24:19,364
I will create a place
where you belong.

307
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,460
Who are you?

308
00:24:22,732 --> 00:24:24,942
First, we'll start with this nation.

309
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,967
You have toiled to dispose
of your comrades up until now.

310
00:24:29,581 --> 00:24:32,458
From now on, work with me
as my comrade.

311
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,183
You seem to have trust in me.

312
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:39,689
But I still don't know who you are.

313
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,484
Those eyes...
that gleam in the dark!

314
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,655
I see...

315
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:54,994
The one I thought was
the Fourth Mizukage...

316
00:24:55,019 --> 00:24:56,312
was actually you.

317
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:01,424
To think the Fourth was being
manipulated by the Sharingan.

318
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:06,129
This world really is full of lies.

319
00:25:06,807 --> 00:25:09,900
To manipulate the Fourth,
the Three-Tails Jinchuriki...

320
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,427
...that is some ocular power.

321
00:25:12,894 --> 00:25:15,271
Just who are you?

322
00:25:16,989 --> 00:25:19,201
I am... Madara Uchiha.

323
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:24,523
He is supposed to be dead.

324
00:25:24,716 --> 00:25:26,801
I don't believe you.

325
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,735
Show yourself.

326
00:25:29,911 --> 00:25:30,912
Fine.

327
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:35,033
You can decide whether
to trust me or not.

328
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,791
His tongue...
He bit off his own tongue!

329
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:47,030
He woke himself up to prevent me
from extracting intel.

330
00:25:51,335 --> 00:25:53,253
<i>Are you serious?</i>

331
00:25:54,012 --> 00:25:58,684
Yes... That is my plan...
Project Tsuki no Me.

332
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:02,063
<i>That is a true world free of lies.</i>

333
00:26:07,727 --> 00:26:10,517
<i>I would have liked to see that...</i>

334
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,830
<i>I was using my Wood Style
to suppress his chakra,</i>

335
00:26:22,091 --> 00:26:23,509
<i>but he still has so much power left.</i>

336
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,418
He just doesn't know
when to give up.

337
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,295
Capture him alive!

338
00:26:28,662 --> 00:26:30,456
We'll never have
another chance like this!

339
00:26:30,692 --> 00:26:32,694
I want to extract
more intel from him!

340
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:34,927
I know that!

341
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:36,720
<i>Water Prison Jutsu!</i>

342
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,725
<i>I can't reach him because
of this wall of water!</i>

343
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,602
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

344
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:48,481
<i>Itachi... It's just like you said.</i>

345
00:26:50,826 --> 00:26:53,946
I'll be teaming up with you
from now on.

346
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:58,459
I'm Kisame Hoshigaki,
formerly of the Hidden Mist,

347
00:26:58,484 --> 00:27:00,677
and an ex-member of
the Seven Ninja Swordsmen.

348
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,382
Pleased to meet you.

349
00:27:04,865 --> 00:27:09,185
And you are Itachi Uchiha,
formerly of the Hidden Leaf.

350
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,670
I've heard the rumors...

351
00:27:11,855 --> 00:27:15,855
You slaughtered all of
your fellow Uchiha clansmen.

352
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,640
I understand you well.

353
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:27,020
That's the reason why I decided to
team up with the Akatsuki.

354
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:36,847
The sensation that comes from killing your
comrade is indescribable, isn't it, Itachi?

355
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,158
You talk a lot.

356
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:46,765
You may know a lot about me,
but what about yourself?

357
00:27:49,276 --> 00:27:51,828
You got lost in the mist
and ended up here.

358
00:27:52,454 --> 00:27:55,532
You're just a thug who
couldn't figure out where to go.

359
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,275
Isn't that so?

360
00:28:01,405 --> 00:28:03,974
Do you want to know
something interesting?

361
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:07,594
Some sharks are ovoviviparous,
which means the eggs

362
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:11,465
hatch inside the
female's body, then are born.

363
00:28:11,848 --> 00:28:17,320
However, with some kinds of sharks,
the number of eggs that hatch

364
00:28:17,345 --> 00:28:19,732
don't match up with
the number of pups born.

365
00:28:19,757 --> 00:28:21,607
Do you know why?

366
00:28:29,859 --> 00:28:31,443
Cannibalism.

367
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:34,897
When the eggs hatch,
the pups resort to

368
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:37,240
cannibalizing their siblings
in the mother's stomach.

369
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:43,129
From the moment they're born,
the fratricide begins.

370
00:28:43,705 --> 00:28:47,826
Other than itself,
every other pup is fodder.

371
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:52,463
From today, you and I
belong to Akatsuki.

372
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:55,109
Please be wary...

373
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,302
of me.

374
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:03,259
That goes for you too...

375
00:29:06,862 --> 00:29:10,423
Anyway, let's have some fun together.

376
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:14,728
And hope that we're not
the last two facing each other.

377
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:18,056
Anyone who has raised
their hand against a comrade,

378
00:29:18,081 --> 00:29:20,458
even once,
never dies a decent death.

379
00:29:21,185 --> 00:29:22,585
Remember that.

380
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:29,584
Which means you and I
are both worthless.

381
00:29:30,327 --> 00:29:31,202
No...

382
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,437
We aren't fish, we're human.

383
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,394
No matter who you are...

384
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:42,299
You do not know what kind of human
you are until the very end.

385
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,740
<i>One realizes their true nature
at the moment of death.</i>

386
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:51,270
<i>That's the way to view death.</i>

387
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:52,765
<i>Itachi...</i>

388
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:55,351
<i>Did you realize
the kind of person you were...</i>

389
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:59,522
<i>at the moment of your death?</i>

390
00:30:01,441 --> 00:30:02,525
<i>Itachi...</i>

391
00:30:02,942 --> 00:30:06,529
<i>It seems I wasn't such...</i>

392
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:08,740
<i>a worthless human, after all.</i>

393
00:30:33,139 --> 00:30:36,768
Feeding yourself to the shark
you just summoned...

394
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,167
He was already quite weak.

395
00:30:41,397 --> 00:30:43,900
He figured out that
he couldn't escape us.

396
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:50,531
The Akatsuki member who was
paired up with Itachi himself...

397
00:30:51,073 --> 00:30:53,743
The one who was feared as
the scourge of the Hidden Mist.

398
00:30:53,864 --> 00:30:56,700
It's hard to believe this is
the way Kisame Hoshigaki met his end.

399
00:30:58,086 --> 00:30:59,838
Is he really dead?

400
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:06,255
This fella's downhearted

401
00:31:06,881 --> 00:31:09,258
Looks like it's for real this time.

402
00:31:09,425 --> 00:31:10,510
The guy's already departed.

403
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:12,804
But...

404
00:31:13,429 --> 00:31:17,308
He did this so that we, his enemy,
wouldn't get any intel.

405
00:31:18,511 --> 00:31:19,888
Even in the Akatsuki,

406
00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:22,928
there was someone
who put his comrades first.

407
00:31:30,112 --> 00:31:31,906
He may have been a foe,
but he died admirably.

408
00:31:32,033 --> 00:31:33,410
The measure of a shinobi's life
is determined

409
00:31:33,572 --> 00:31:35,323
by the manner of his death.

410
00:31:38,685 --> 00:31:40,187
Kisame Hoshigaki!

411
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,949
I shall remember you
for the rest of my life!

412
00:31:48,256 --> 00:31:52,426
In any case, no intel was leaked
to the Akatsuki.

413
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:57,098
He intended to put down intel about
us onto this scroll and get out of here.

414
00:31:57,574 --> 00:32:00,201
Let's check the contents
of the scroll.

415
00:32:01,077 --> 00:32:03,142
If we know what kind of data
he was after,

416
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:04,676
it will make
counter-intelligence easier.

417
00:32:04,701 --> 00:32:05,702
You're right.

418
00:32:11,237 --> 00:32:12,530
The water is so heavy...

419
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,073
This is the Water Prison Jutsu!

420
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:19,579
It was a booby trap!

421
00:32:19,787 --> 00:32:20,997
Watch out!

422
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,644
Sharks!

423
00:32:26,961 --> 00:32:28,838
Damn, it's making its way
towards the ocean!

424
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:31,439
The water pressure is making it
hard to move!

425
00:32:31,985 --> 00:32:33,526
Fools, ya fool!

426
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,529
I used up all my strength
on the Eight Inner Gates...

427
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,093
Guy, hang in there!

428
00:32:39,872 --> 00:32:41,958
Watch where you're biting!

429
00:32:45,745 --> 00:32:47,706
Damn it! It's getting away!

430
00:32:48,086 --> 00:32:49,504
What do we do?!

431
00:33:21,301 --> 00:33:22,594
Looking for something?

432
00:33:23,261 --> 00:33:23,970
Yeah.

433
00:33:25,565 --> 00:33:27,734
Where have you hidden Nagato's body?

434
00:33:28,934 --> 00:33:30,310
You won't find him here.

435
00:34:26,157 --> 00:34:27,284
Rinnegan...

436
00:34:28,034 --> 00:34:29,911
It seems you aren't going
to cooperate

437
00:34:29,995 --> 00:34:31,830
and tell me where you hid Nagato.

438
00:34:32,914 --> 00:34:36,167
I knew that you would
appear before me.

439
00:34:36,626 --> 00:34:37,961
I've been waiting for you.

440
00:34:38,503 --> 00:34:40,380
So I could stop you.

441
00:34:42,299 --> 00:34:45,385
Just because you used to be a comrade
does not mean I'll show you any mercy.

442
00:34:45,802 --> 00:34:47,929
The Akatsuki does not
put up with traitors.

443
00:34:48,847 --> 00:34:49,848
Understand?

444
00:34:51,421 --> 00:34:52,839
I have one question.

445
00:34:53,521 --> 00:34:56,732
Why would such loyal members
as you both betray me?

446
00:34:58,752 --> 00:35:02,547
You and Nagato both approved
of my Project Tsuki no Me.

447
00:35:03,394 --> 00:35:08,483
Naruto Uzumaki...
You think he's that worthy?

448
00:35:09,961 --> 00:35:11,212
He is the light.

449
00:35:11,395 --> 00:35:13,188
That's why we...

450
00:35:13,317 --> 00:35:15,194
will make the flowers of hope bloom!

451
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,670
You bare your fangs at me, yet
you still continue to wear that cloak.

452
00:35:21,603 --> 00:35:23,856
I see that you are still attached
to the Akatsuki.

453
00:35:25,258 --> 00:35:27,719
Yahiko founded the Akatsuki.

454
00:35:28,803 --> 00:35:31,303
The red cloud on this cloak
symbolizes the blood

455
00:35:31,328 --> 00:35:35,082
that rained over
the Hidden Rain from war!

456
00:35:36,061 --> 00:35:38,688
You merely latched onto the Akatsuki.

457
00:35:39,022 --> 00:35:42,943
These cloaks represent our justice,
not yours.

458
00:35:43,777 --> 00:35:46,738
Furthermore, Nagato,
a shinobi of the Hidden Rain,

459
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,823
awakened the Rinnegan.

460
00:35:49,699 --> 00:35:52,285
And that too, does not belong to you.

461
00:35:52,452 --> 00:35:56,206
His eyes are this nation's...
this village's treasure!

462
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,214
You are mistaken on two points.

463
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:07,173
It's all over for you anyway,
so I will tell you.

464
00:36:08,843 --> 00:36:12,681
I am the one who encouraged Yahiko
to establish the Akatsuki.

465
00:36:15,831 --> 00:36:18,709
And I was also the one
who gave Nagato the Rinnegan.

466
00:36:20,783 --> 00:36:24,162
So it's only right for me
to ask for it back.

467
00:36:25,477 --> 00:36:26,770
Well, no matter.

468
00:36:26,887 --> 00:36:30,474
As far as I'm concerned, you're
just a girl who knows nothing.

469
00:36:31,501 --> 00:36:36,172
Except that, right now,
you know where Nagato's Rinnegan is.

470
00:36:37,507 --> 00:36:40,426
Once I capture you,
I can do anything I want.

471
00:36:41,211 --> 00:36:44,173
Do not underestimate
the visual prowess of the Uchiha, girl!

472
00:36:52,637 --> 00:36:54,347
<i>Using a manifold attack,</i>

473
00:36:54,389 --> 00:36:57,017
<i>she intends to find a chance
to attack when I materialize.</i>

474
00:36:57,517 --> 00:37:01,688
<i>Fine. I know she has
some strategy to tempt me.</i>

475
00:37:01,856 --> 00:37:03,524
<i>I accept her challenge!</i>

476
00:37:06,403 --> 00:37:07,251
Over here!

477
00:37:11,823 --> 00:37:13,408
<i>She mixed in paper bombs!</i>

478
00:37:16,286 --> 00:37:18,455
I will take you with me
to the afterlife.

479
00:37:35,547 --> 00:37:37,163
I didn't take you seriously enough.

480
00:37:37,996 --> 00:37:41,743
I should have remembered that you
are a former member of the Akatsuki...

481
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:48,386
The moment I sucked you in,

482
00:37:48,411 --> 00:37:50,913
you intended to blow yourself up,
and take me with you.

483
00:37:51,613 --> 00:37:53,156
However, you failed.

484
00:37:53,715 --> 00:37:55,592
I sucked in the explosion itself.

485
00:37:55,617 --> 00:37:59,537
I was faster, although I felt
a little of the impact.

486
00:38:00,158 --> 00:38:02,410
And luckily, you were spared too.

487
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,875
You should be grateful.

488
00:38:06,215 --> 00:38:09,218
Does this mean
your secret strategy is over?

489
00:38:10,316 --> 00:38:12,819
Madara, let me ask you one thing.

490
00:38:14,357 --> 00:38:15,358
What is it?

491
00:38:16,235 --> 00:38:19,614
Do you know why we betrayed you?

492
00:38:20,016 --> 00:38:22,477
Do you know why
we have faith in Naruto?

493
00:38:23,353 --> 00:38:26,606
Well now... That's your problem.

494
00:38:28,189 --> 00:38:32,195
Besides, Naruto is just a naïve
child chasing after an immature dream.

495
00:38:32,779 --> 00:38:34,851
I can see if Nagato was swayed

496
00:38:34,876 --> 00:38:37,158
by the thought of true peace
and hope.

497
00:38:37,183 --> 00:38:39,519
But you too, Konan?

498
00:38:40,453 --> 00:38:42,914
I realized something
after meeting Naruto.

499
00:38:44,124 --> 00:38:45,625
You are darkness.

500
00:38:47,836 --> 00:38:52,006
Flowers can only wilt in
a world without light!

501
00:39:11,943 --> 00:39:13,111
I won't let you get away!

502
00:39:24,038 --> 00:39:26,374
Your teleportation failed.

503
00:39:26,993 --> 00:39:30,079
I've been paying attention
to you all this time.

504
00:39:31,065 --> 00:39:35,028
When you suck in yourself,
you always materialize yourself.

505
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:39,744
And it takes longer to suck yourself in
than another person or object.

506
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:48,109
<i>If I didn't stop teleporting and shift
to the side to evade the explosion,</i>

507
00:39:48,134 --> 00:39:50,262
<i>things would've turned nasty.</i>

508
00:39:50,978 --> 00:39:53,564
<i>Furthermore, you are only able</i>

509
00:39:53,589 --> 00:39:55,424
<i>to pass through objects
for five minutes!</i>

510
00:39:57,322 --> 00:39:58,323
<i>What are these?</i>

511
00:40:00,992 --> 00:40:02,952
<i>They're all paper bombs...</i>

512
00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:13,004
I amassed 600 billion paper bombs
in order to kill you...

513
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,647
And they will continue
exploding for ten minutes!

514
00:40:32,104 --> 00:40:36,149
<i>I am the one who encouraged Yahiko
to establish the Akatsuki.</i>

515
00:40:36,907 --> 00:40:39,868
<i>And I was also the one who
gave Nagato the Rinnegan.</i>

516
00:40:44,035 --> 00:40:47,554
<i>Both Yahiko and Nagato were
acting on their own free will.</i>

517
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,971
<i>They were not your pawns!</i>

518
00:41:04,055 --> 00:41:08,184
<i>You and Konan must do
everything you can to survive!</i>

519
00:41:10,253 --> 00:41:12,089
<i>Whichever way they chose...</i>

520
00:41:12,114 --> 00:41:15,034
<i>They both fought and died
following their beliefs!</i>

521
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,444
<i>That is why their will is connected!</i>

522
00:41:19,696 --> 00:41:21,030
I will not let you interfere!

523
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,452
<i>My Sacred Paper Emissary Jutsu
has come undone.</i>

524
00:41:43,646 --> 00:41:47,441
<i>I didn't expect it to take
this much chakra.</i>

525
00:41:47,945 --> 00:41:49,113
<i>At least...</i>

526
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,730
<i>Madara is...</i>

527
00:41:55,231 --> 00:41:56,649
... Is dead?

528
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:16,210
How? You should be dead.

529
00:42:16,881 --> 00:42:18,883
I ran the simulations over and over.

530
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:23,713
I was sure this sequence
would work.

531
00:42:25,011 --> 00:42:26,387
The Izanagi...

532
00:42:26,801 --> 00:42:29,095
In exchange for losing sight
in that eye,

533
00:42:29,223 --> 00:42:31,934
a user can connect illusion
and reality.

534
00:42:31,959 --> 00:42:33,461
It's a Forbidden Jutsu
of the Uchiha.

535
00:42:34,729 --> 00:42:37,076
Only those who
possess both the powers

536
00:42:37,101 --> 00:42:40,800
of the Uchiha and Senju
can use this Forbidden Jutsu!

537
00:42:41,444 --> 00:42:44,572
Uchiha and Senju?
Both powers?

538
00:42:45,585 --> 00:42:47,671
But that's the power
of the Six Paths.

539
00:42:48,117 --> 00:42:50,536
You do not have that power...

540
00:42:52,978 --> 00:42:55,438
Since you are a former comrade of mine,

541
00:42:55,463 --> 00:42:59,300
I will tell you a little about
my jutsu and myself.

542
00:43:00,651 --> 00:43:03,404
The Izanagi is simply
the practical application

543
00:43:03,429 --> 00:43:07,375
of what you already know as the
Sage of Six Paths' Creation of all Things.

544
00:43:08,596 --> 00:43:11,891
Originally, the Uchiha and Senju
were one and the same.

545
00:43:12,308 --> 00:43:14,060
The Sage of the Six Paths
was their founder

546
00:43:14,143 --> 00:43:17,434
and he passed on his blood
and power to these two.

547
00:43:17,459 --> 00:43:19,433
He also created many things.

548
00:43:20,775 --> 00:43:24,094
With the power of Yin Style, based upon
spiritual energy that governs imagination

549
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:26,205
... he created form out of nothingness.

550
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,658
And with the power of Yang Style,

551
00:43:28,683 --> 00:43:31,952
based upon physical energy
that governs life...

552
00:43:31,977 --> 00:43:37,149
... he breathed life into those forms.

553
00:43:38,626 --> 00:43:40,545
The Tailed Beasts are
one such example.

554
00:43:41,103 --> 00:43:44,148
He used the powers of Yin and Yang

555
00:43:44,173 --> 00:43:46,759
to create the Tailed Beasts from
the chakra of the Ten-Tails.

556
00:43:47,566 --> 00:43:50,527
The incarnation of imagination
into life...

557
00:43:50,936 --> 00:43:52,729
that is the jutsu known as Izanagi.

558
00:43:53,143 --> 00:43:56,229
Just who are you?

559
00:43:57,395 --> 00:44:02,191
The world knows Madara Uchiha was
the one who lost to Hashirama Senju.

560
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:04,944
However, what is the real truth?

561
00:44:05,528 --> 00:44:08,114
The victor is the one
who can gaze into the future.

562
00:44:09,084 --> 00:44:11,211
The real challenge begins from now.

563
00:44:11,906 --> 00:44:15,743
The previous battle was merely
to obtain his power.

564
00:44:16,995 --> 00:44:20,832
I am Madara Uchiha, and I possess
the power of Hashirama Senju.

565
00:44:21,586 --> 00:44:25,006
I am the second Sage of
the Six Paths. I am unique.

566
00:44:26,132 --> 00:44:28,344
Unable to master Hashirama's power,

567
00:44:28,369 --> 00:44:32,415
some have tried to use
an imperfect Izanagi, and failed.

568
00:44:43,441 --> 00:44:46,569
In the afterlife,
the two of you can commiserate...

569
00:44:46,903 --> 00:44:49,572
about being fooled
by Naruto's nonsense.

570
00:44:51,824 --> 00:44:53,868
There is no such thing
as true peace!

571
00:44:56,579 --> 00:44:58,664
There is no such thing as hope!

572
00:45:03,144 --> 00:45:05,612
Nagato only believed in Naruto
because he wanted

573
00:45:05,637 --> 00:45:08,515
to find solace within
his pathetic existence.

574
00:45:26,821 --> 00:45:28,906
<i>This can't be...</i>

575
00:45:31,887 --> 00:45:36,016
<i>Nagato is going to be
the bridge to peace.</i>

576
00:45:36,536 --> 00:45:39,997
<i>My job is to be a pillar
that supports that bridge.</i>

577
00:45:40,884 --> 00:45:45,597
<i>He is the bridge to peace.
His will itself is the bridge.</i>

578
00:45:47,117 --> 00:45:49,885
<i>I guess this is
as far as it goes for me.</i>

579
00:45:50,424 --> 00:45:54,595
<i>Naruto... I know you can truly—</i>

580
00:45:57,557 --> 00:45:59,642
The rain in the Hidden Rain
is never ending...

581
00:46:00,979 --> 00:46:01,980
What's going on?

582
00:46:03,649 --> 00:46:05,109
Yahiko! Nagato!

583
00:46:05,981 --> 00:46:07,817
Your will shall not be extinguished!

584
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,601
I also believe in Naruto!

585
00:46:10,794 --> 00:46:12,253
It's his turn now!

586
00:46:12,572 --> 00:46:15,199
He is the bridge to peace!

587
00:46:15,658 --> 00:46:18,911
And I shall be his pillar!

588
00:46:20,791 --> 00:46:22,668
<i>Thank you, Nagato.</i>

589
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:26,792
<i>Your death has made my dream
even clearer to me.</i>

590
00:46:27,965 --> 00:46:29,965
<i>I am expendable, a mere flower.</i>

591
00:46:30,598 --> 00:46:31,891
<i>I shall take you with me.</i>

592
00:47:06,169 --> 00:47:08,421
You called me darkness.

593
00:47:09,807 --> 00:47:12,059
Well then, I shall make you wilt.

594
00:47:12,084 --> 00:47:14,169
And I shall also make your rainbow,

595
00:47:14,194 --> 00:47:17,280
this seven-colored bridge of peace,
fade into the darkness as well.

596
00:47:19,655 --> 00:47:23,033
When this genjutsu is over,
it will be the end of you too.

597
00:47:23,405 --> 00:47:26,366
After I make you tell me
where the Rinnegan is.

598
00:47:49,704 --> 00:47:50,831
So this is the place...

599
00:47:56,351 --> 00:47:59,381
You are the third
Sage of the Six Paths.

600
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:04,965
The red hair that was once proof
of your Uzumaki lineage...

601
00:48:05,346 --> 00:48:08,766
turned white from exerting
a power so strong.

602
00:48:13,353 --> 00:48:16,106
You betrayed me,
and still you laugh at me?

603
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:37,252
That took some time.

604
00:49:01,234 --> 00:49:03,653
<i>We are leaving this place</i>

605
00:49:03,695 --> 00:49:05,196
<i>in order to make
our dreams come true!</i>

606
00:49:05,583 --> 00:49:08,002
<i>And once that happens...</i>

607
00:49:09,242 --> 00:49:11,369
<i>Even if we are split apart,</i>

608
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:14,243
<i>let's meet back here one day...</i>

609
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:22,371
<i>And the three of us will
celebrate together!</i>

610
00:49:22,515 --> 00:49:26,060
<i>Yes. Then we should invite
Jiraiya-sensei too!</i>

611
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,510
<i>Yes!</i>

612
00:49:27,844 --> 00:49:29,763
<i>I guess you're right!</i>

613
00:49:40,065 --> 00:49:43,109
That took a lot of trouble,
but you got yourself a nice eye.

614
00:49:44,105 --> 00:49:46,107
It was always mine.

615
00:49:46,851 --> 00:49:49,520
By the way, this arrived too.

616
00:49:49,699 --> 00:49:50,700
What is it?

617
00:49:50,951 --> 00:49:53,036
Intel from Kisame.

618
00:49:54,833 --> 00:49:56,960
We've learned the whereabouts
of the Nine-Tails.

619
00:49:57,937 --> 00:50:01,607
<i>Everything is going our way.</i>

620
00:50:01,753 --> 00:50:04,381
So this is from Kisame.

621
00:50:08,009 --> 00:50:09,719
Let's go collect the Nine-Tails!

622
00:50:11,831 --> 00:50:12,832
Wait...

623
00:50:13,173 --> 00:50:16,593
I will go to the Eight and
Nine-Tails' location.

624
00:50:18,878 --> 00:50:20,212
What are you up to?

625
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:25,064
It's a good chance to build trust
and strengthen our alliance.

626
00:50:25,986 --> 00:50:28,989
Furthermore, Naruto, the Nine-Tails,

627
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:33,410
always has someone close by in the form
of Yamato, the copy of the First Hokage.

628
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:37,241
I want him for my experiments.

629
00:50:38,799 --> 00:50:42,053
If I can't go,
I'd settle for Zetsu's body.

630
00:50:43,169 --> 00:50:45,255
If you'd let me have one of him.

631
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:50,218
Also, the revival of the Ten-Tails
isn't far off, is it?

632
00:50:52,303 --> 00:50:55,807
You seem to be very well-informed.

633
00:50:56,474 --> 00:51:00,395
I knew Orochimaru was secretly
checking around, but...

634
00:51:01,996 --> 00:51:04,540
According to intel that Kisame sent,

635
00:51:05,054 --> 00:51:08,169
the Allied Shinobi Force
is 80,000 strong.

636
00:51:08,194 --> 00:51:10,155
We also know what
their military formation is like.

637
00:51:10,196 --> 00:51:14,993
But the key military power for
this side is Zetsu here, right?

638
00:51:15,035 --> 00:51:17,203
<i>Just how much do you know?!</i>

639
00:51:18,038 --> 00:51:21,666
With the data I have gathered
and my knowledge,

640
00:51:21,708 --> 00:51:23,918
I can maximize Zetsu's strength.

641
00:51:24,669 --> 00:51:29,340
On the condition that
you take me there.

642
00:51:30,091 --> 00:51:32,761
Will you trust a guy like him?

643
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:42,593
If you bring me the Nine-Tails,
I will give you one of Zetsu.

644
00:51:44,208 --> 00:51:45,209
Follow me.

645
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:56,430
This is...

646
00:51:58,588 --> 00:51:59,840
the Gedo Statue.

647
00:52:07,974 --> 00:52:09,392
It's down here.

648
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:33,154
This is...

649
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:35,526
Yes, he's alive.

650
00:52:37,437 --> 00:52:40,482
That's the First Hokage,
Hashirama Senju.

651
00:52:43,373 --> 00:52:46,835
Well, what I stole from him
during that battle...

652
00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:50,296
is nothing more than what
I cultivated from living cells.

653
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:51,748
He's not conscious.

654
00:52:52,475 --> 00:52:56,354
But what you're interested in
is down below.

655
00:52:59,806 --> 00:53:02,767
This is amazing. Since when?

656
00:53:03,101 --> 00:53:05,228
However, there's a risk.

657
00:53:05,433 --> 00:53:07,769
I used a considerable amount
of chakra

658
00:53:07,794 --> 00:53:11,048
from the Tailed Beasts inside
the Gedo Statue to create this.

659
00:53:11,671 --> 00:53:13,673
I want to preserve it
as much as possible.

660
00:53:13,987 --> 00:53:15,939
If the revival of
the Ten-Tails is delayed,

661
00:53:15,964 --> 00:53:18,508
it means my plans are
delayed as well.

662
00:53:19,244 --> 00:53:21,371
How many are here?

663
00:53:32,964 --> 00:53:35,216
Roughly 100,000.

664
00:53:43,641 --> 00:53:45,852
Lost sight of my target.

665
00:53:46,001 --> 00:53:49,546
That spy pulled one over me.
Should have figured out their intent...

666
00:53:59,661 --> 00:54:01,330
Are you all right, Guy-sensei?

667
00:54:02,035 --> 00:54:03,411
I'll help you out!

668
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:08,541
Hey! Do not touch Guy right now!

669
00:54:08,917 --> 00:54:11,252
He'll be experiencing the after-effects
of the Eight Inner Gates soon.

670
00:54:11,294 --> 00:54:14,088
Even the slightest touch will cause him
intense pain all over his body!

671
00:54:14,339 --> 00:54:16,216
What? Really?

672
00:54:18,051 --> 00:54:19,052
I'm sorry, ya know!

673
00:54:21,179 --> 00:54:22,931
Quietly, quietly!

674
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,147
Because of the Water Prison Jutsu,

675
00:54:25,381 --> 00:54:28,134
I wasn't able to send a message
about the intel leak.

676
00:54:28,916 --> 00:54:32,045
I think we can conclude that
the enemy knows about this location.

677
00:54:33,347 --> 00:54:37,143
Which means we must act quickly
to relocate Bee and Naruto!

678
00:54:37,898 --> 00:54:41,062
The enemy will figure that out too
and take immediate action!

679
00:54:41,705 --> 00:54:43,865
I understand, but...

680
00:54:46,836 --> 00:54:48,838
We will relocate them, but not by ship.

681
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:51,080
They will remain on this island.

682
00:54:51,398 --> 00:54:51,982
What?

683
00:54:52,007 --> 00:54:53,258
Leave him alone!

684
00:54:53,452 --> 00:54:54,870
Bee! How did it go?

685
00:54:55,046 --> 00:54:56,172
Not good!

686
00:54:56,214 --> 00:54:58,132
Fool, ya fool.

687
00:54:58,925 --> 00:55:01,577
What do you mean when
you say you'll relocate them,

688
00:55:01,602 --> 00:55:03,145
but they'll remain on this island?

689
00:55:04,025 --> 00:55:05,943
You can't even find this island
on a map.

690
00:55:06,391 --> 00:55:09,477
Even if they try to find it,
it won't be that easy.

691
00:55:11,187 --> 00:55:13,189
That's because this island...

692
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,821
Y-You're huge!

693
00:55:20,446 --> 00:55:25,118
<i>But I am still a very,
very small turtle.</i>

694
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:26,452
Impossible!

695
00:55:26,786 --> 00:55:31,040
I've never seen nor heard of
any turtle larger than you!

696
00:55:38,172 --> 00:55:39,465
What did you say?!

697
00:55:39,882 --> 00:55:43,803
Yes, a mobile stronghold,
an island that can move.

698
00:55:44,984 --> 00:55:48,529
This is a colossal turtle reared
by the Hidden Cloud since ancient times.

699
00:55:52,979 --> 00:55:54,939
Ouch!

700
00:55:55,047 --> 00:55:58,467
We can say for sure that
the enemy knows about this.

701
00:55:58,767 --> 00:56:01,145
However, this island is much safer

702
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:04,048
than returning to the Hidden Cloud
Village by ship.

703
00:56:04,383 --> 00:56:07,261
Besides, hasn't Naruto been told
that he's here on this island

704
00:56:07,522 --> 00:56:09,315
for a top-secret ecological
survey mission?

705
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:12,373
He'll get suspicious if
we tell him we're already leaving.

706
00:56:12,582 --> 00:56:16,085
It seriously hurts!

707
00:56:19,964 --> 00:56:22,925
The Five Great Nations face
an extremely critical situation.

708
00:56:22,925 --> 00:56:26,012
And as they prepare for
the Fourth Great Ninja War,

709
00:56:26,054 --> 00:56:29,223
there is concern that the shinobi and
samurai units will not be sufficient.

710
00:56:29,265 --> 00:56:33,186
Hence, a third military unit,
made up of animals will be formed.

711
00:56:33,978 --> 00:56:36,647
To this end, it has been decided
that a Jinchuriki

712
00:56:37,025 --> 00:56:39,000
who is able to communicate with
and understand animals...

713
00:56:39,025 --> 00:56:41,915
One who loves animals such as
Naruto Uzumaki, will be assigned

714
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:45,777
the task of selecting and
organizing this animal unit.

715
00:56:46,822 --> 00:56:50,368
He will start by analyzing
the biology of the animals,

716
00:56:50,724 --> 00:56:52,934
– Can we pass off...
– then ascertain their strengths...

717
00:56:52,959 --> 00:56:54,752
– such a childish trick?
– and categorize them...

718
00:56:54,777 --> 00:56:56,738
– We have to.
– by gender and physical attributes.

719
00:56:56,959 --> 00:56:59,629
This is a top-secret S-rank mission!

720
00:56:59,915 --> 00:57:02,375
Work diligently.

721
00:57:03,132 --> 00:57:05,468
Fifth Hokage Tsunade of
the Hidden Leaf Village.

722
00:57:14,604 --> 00:57:16,981
To arrive here to find that
intel has been leaked...

723
00:57:17,156 --> 00:57:19,742
We'll have to rethink our strategy.

724
00:57:20,391 --> 00:57:22,184
But as long as they know that

725
00:57:22,209 --> 00:57:24,544
the Allied Shinobi Forces
are aware of the leak,

726
00:57:24,737 --> 00:57:26,989
they will watch the situation.

727
00:57:27,657 --> 00:57:30,660
Perhaps it will be easier
to lay some traps.

728
00:57:30,975 --> 00:57:32,185
What about the island?

729
00:57:32,984 --> 00:57:35,570
Even if it's mobile,
we can't let our guard down.

730
00:57:36,374 --> 00:57:37,792
Those two are their targets.

731
00:57:38,292 --> 00:57:40,253
They are sure to come
in search of them.

732
00:57:40,795 --> 00:57:45,716
I established an escape route
just for situations like this.

733
00:57:46,208 --> 00:57:48,002
In addition, the clouds hide it.

734
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:50,196
The enemy will not be able
to find it.

735
00:57:50,638 --> 00:57:51,931
If they come searching,

736
00:57:51,993 --> 00:57:54,787
the enemy will probably
send a small reconnaissance team first.

737
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:59,897
They won't infiltrate and try
to divide our troops, will they?

738
00:58:00,535 --> 00:58:04,497
There's no doubt Kisame put
the coordinates of the island on the map.

739
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:08,673
Even if we move,
they will search the area thoroughly.

740
00:58:08,698 --> 00:58:10,116
We can't lose focus.

741
00:58:10,381 --> 00:58:12,716
In any case, send reinforcements.

742
00:58:13,088 --> 00:58:15,049
But it will be meaningless

743
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:17,284
if the enemy spots us
mobilizing large groups.

744
00:58:17,481 --> 00:58:20,318
Send a few of the elite.

745
00:58:21,450 --> 00:58:22,534
I will go!

746
00:58:23,337 --> 00:58:24,547
Lord Tsuchikage!

747
00:58:25,697 --> 00:58:28,742
Old Ohnoki?
Then I have no complaints.

748
00:58:29,104 --> 00:58:30,147
Same here.

749
00:58:30,172 --> 00:58:32,924
Someone who can fly through
the air will move swiftly.

750
00:58:33,570 --> 00:58:35,489
Is it really all right?

751
00:58:35,897 --> 00:58:37,607
Don't worry, Kazekage!

752
00:58:38,092 --> 00:58:42,815
I am the Tsuchikage, feared as
the Fence Sitter of the Hidden Stone!

753
00:58:45,568 --> 00:58:46,944
My back!

754
00:58:46,986 --> 00:58:48,488
I will go, after all.

755
00:58:48,529 --> 00:58:49,655
I can ride my sand and
be there in no time...

756
00:58:49,783 --> 00:58:52,494
Fool! I said I would go.

757
00:59:00,124 --> 00:59:02,543
Well, you guys relax.

758
00:59:03,794 --> 00:59:04,962
We're off.

759
00:59:10,985 --> 00:59:12,570
It's the ocean from here on out.

760
00:59:13,012 --> 00:59:14,639
We'll have to fly.

761
00:59:15,267 --> 00:59:18,019
Yay! It's been so long since I flew!

762
00:59:18,102 --> 00:59:19,687
This is going to be fun!

763
00:59:19,727 --> 00:59:21,687
Don't get so excited, Akatsuchi!

764
00:59:21,854 --> 00:59:23,731
We could be entering into a battle!

765
00:59:26,692 --> 00:59:27,860
Yay!

766
00:59:27,902 --> 00:59:29,654
I said to quit playing around,
you brat!

767
00:59:29,695 --> 00:59:30,821
You're so embarrassing!

768
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:33,903
<i>Damn it! It does look like fun!</i>

769
00:59:33,991 --> 00:59:36,494
<i>But I can't get excited right now.</i>

770
00:59:36,577 --> 00:59:38,207
<i>Damn that Akatsuchi!</i>

771
00:59:38,232 --> 00:59:39,780
You're up next Kurotsuchi.

772
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:43,003
Guess I have no choice...

773
00:59:46,368 --> 00:59:48,662
Looks like you're awake at last.

774
00:59:49,548 --> 00:59:52,510
It's a different seal from
Lord Orochimaru's.

775
00:59:53,309 --> 00:59:56,938
I won't bind you completely... Deidara.

776
00:59:58,183 --> 01:00:00,435
I don't know anything about art.

777
01:00:01,102 --> 01:00:02,645
And I know little about you.

778
01:00:03,262 --> 01:00:10,477
Well, my ninjutsu art isn't easy
to understand... Hmm!

779
01:00:11,433 --> 01:00:16,605
But I'm grateful to you.
I once perfected the ultimate art.

780
01:00:16,974 --> 01:00:19,393
So now, I can go even further...

781
01:00:20,208 --> 01:00:23,628
Speaking of which,
that last explosion of yours...

782
01:00:24,085 --> 01:00:26,545
It really didn't create a lot of buzz.

783
01:00:27,458 --> 01:00:28,667
I just told you!

784
01:00:28,729 --> 01:00:30,564
My art is not easy to understand!

785
01:00:30,987 --> 01:00:34,491
These things take time... Hmm...

786
01:00:37,733 --> 01:00:40,861
I said to line up straight!

787
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:43,832
Hurry and get into the tunnel!

788
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:47,064
Listen up! The ecological survey
will start once you're inside.

789
01:00:48,774 --> 01:00:50,568
Cut it out!

790
01:00:51,166 --> 01:00:52,543
You want to fight again?

791
01:00:56,157 --> 01:01:01,787
Damn it! It's tough moving
all these animals.

792
01:01:02,622 --> 01:01:05,750
I win again! Rock, Scissors, Paper!

793
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:07,918
And I'm going to win again
forever and ever!

794
01:01:08,245 --> 01:01:09,872
Hey, you there! Octopus! Crab!

795
01:01:10,129 --> 01:01:12,840
Hey! Line up!

796
01:01:12,882 --> 01:01:15,593
As long as there is a risk of
the Akatsuki coming,

797
01:01:15,593 --> 01:01:18,971
taking refuge inside
the giant turtle shell is a wise move.

798
01:01:19,847 --> 01:01:24,101
Plus, Naruto is really taking
this mission seriously.

799
01:01:24,952 --> 01:01:28,581
It will be disastrous if
Naruto finds out about the war.

800
01:01:29,366 --> 01:01:32,369
He won't take the news quietly,
he'd rush to the battlefield instead.

801
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,314
We must prevent that at all cost.

802
01:01:35,321 --> 01:01:37,907
After all, this is a war to protect Naruto.

803
01:01:42,172 --> 01:01:45,342
Based on Kisame's intel,
these are the coordinates.

804
01:01:46,733 --> 01:01:48,443
But they've already moved out.

805
01:01:56,926 --> 01:01:58,678
That was a light punch.

806
01:01:59,174 --> 01:02:00,718
<i>I'm certain this person is...</i>

807
01:02:01,138 --> 01:02:03,967
Of all the people to ambush me, it's
none other than the Tsuchikage himself.

808
01:02:03,992 --> 01:02:05,869
I was just testing you out.

809
01:02:06,207 --> 01:02:09,210
Judging from your response,
you're a clone!

810
01:02:09,897 --> 01:02:12,650
<i>It wasn't Madara, after all.</i>

811
01:02:13,658 --> 01:02:14,617
And...

812
01:02:14,642 --> 01:02:16,852
What's going on with bird and Deidara?

813
01:02:17,574 --> 01:02:20,702
Let's just say, they're better
than the original.

814
01:02:22,366 --> 01:02:23,867
However, you are...

815
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,435
a clay clone.

816
01:02:27,748 --> 01:02:30,418
Hey, Old Man Ohnoki.

817
01:02:31,151 --> 01:02:32,402
Long time no see!

818
01:02:32,712 --> 01:02:33,713
You too, huh?

819
01:03:09,123 --> 01:03:12,376
<i>What?! Something is approaching
at high speed!</i>

820
01:03:12,572 --> 01:03:15,158
<i>And it's... not human!</i>

821
01:03:16,672 --> 01:03:17,673
What's the matter?

822
01:03:35,691 --> 01:03:37,651
You took me by surprise.

823
01:03:37,735 --> 01:03:40,279
I had heard that
you were dead, Deidara.

824
01:03:41,155 --> 01:03:43,532
I never expected your clay clones.

825
01:03:44,074 --> 01:03:45,426
So that was...

826
01:03:45,451 --> 01:03:47,120
... a stone clone of the Tsuchikage.

827
01:03:47,998 --> 01:03:50,501
We were thinking
the same thing. Hmm!

828
01:03:51,608 --> 01:03:52,567
Brother Deidara!

829
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:54,280
I thought you blew
yourself up in a big way.

830
01:03:54,305 --> 01:03:55,514
Why are you still alive?

831
01:03:56,375 --> 01:03:58,585
So you didn't die, after all?

832
01:03:58,725 --> 01:04:00,477
Don't get excited, Akatsuchi!

833
01:04:01,717 --> 01:04:04,678
It's Orochimaru's jutsu,
called the Reanimation Jutsu.

834
01:04:04,731 --> 01:04:06,942
It may seem as though
he was brought back to life,

835
01:04:07,223 --> 01:04:09,058
but he's not real.

836
01:04:09,975 --> 01:04:13,062
Damn it. Still causing trouble,
even in death!

837
01:04:14,522 --> 01:04:16,524
A youngster from
the Hidden Leaf beats you...

838
01:04:16,994 --> 01:04:20,122
And then you have the gall
to sneak back in amongst the living!

839
01:04:20,662 --> 01:04:24,499
Shut up!
I killed Sasuke Uchiha... hmm!

840
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:30,692
And now it's your turn, geezer,
for mocking my art! Hmm!

841
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:34,738
<i>Seems Deidara doesn't
know anything.</i>

842
01:04:35,417 --> 01:04:38,796
Enough! I'll capture you both!

843
01:04:39,922 --> 01:04:42,883
Do you intend to get in our way?

844
01:04:43,467 --> 01:04:45,761
I knew we would be ambushed.

845
01:04:46,473 --> 01:04:48,767
You didn't think we'd come
unprepared, did you?

846
01:04:50,075 --> 01:04:51,535
What do you mean?

847
01:05:03,696 --> 01:05:05,614
<i>Seems we found them.</i>

848
01:05:06,198 --> 01:05:08,033
Sorry, but we have to go there.

849
01:05:08,492 --> 01:05:09,535
Why?

850
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:14,827
What? My body won't
respond to me!

851
01:05:15,583 --> 01:05:18,335
No way!
Don't tell me he found them!

852
01:05:18,537 --> 01:05:19,830
We're going after him, you two!

853
01:05:19,855 --> 01:05:20,940
– Right!
– Gotcha!

854
01:05:31,473 --> 01:05:32,850
What's going on?

855
01:05:36,323 --> 01:05:40,744
<i>I used various drugs to activate
the original Manda's cells</i>

856
01:05:40,875 --> 01:05:42,335
<i>to create a second Manda...</i>

857
01:05:42,708 --> 01:05:46,628
<i>He surpasses the first Manda
in size, power, and intellect!</i>

858
01:05:47,859 --> 01:05:51,453
<i>The fact that this island is a moving
animal turns out to be its fatal flaw.</i>

859
01:05:54,685 --> 01:05:55,811
What is that?

860
01:05:56,774 --> 01:05:57,817
An island?

861
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,127
What's that island supposed to be?

862
01:06:00,753 --> 01:06:02,129
It's not an island.

863
01:06:02,379 --> 01:06:04,214
It's a giant turtle and it's moving.

864
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:07,509
And that is where we'll find
the Eight and Nine-Tails.

865
01:06:08,628 --> 01:06:13,492
I get it! So that damn Naruto
is there! Hmm!

866
01:06:14,016 --> 01:06:15,601
What's the plan?

867
01:06:17,456 --> 01:06:20,125
In any case,
we have to stop that turtle island.

868
01:06:21,732 --> 01:06:24,276
Deidara, give me a big one.

869
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:27,321
Damn!

870
01:06:27,402 --> 01:06:28,403
They're fast!

871
01:06:41,773 --> 01:06:42,624
<i>Katsu!</i>

872
01:06:51,992 --> 01:06:54,119
<i>Wood Style:
Deep Forest Emergence!</i>

873
01:07:00,128 --> 01:07:01,170
It flipped over.

874
01:07:01,647 --> 01:07:03,065
It can't move now.

875
01:07:05,484 --> 01:07:06,652
Oww...

876
01:07:08,696 --> 01:07:10,114
What happened?

877
01:07:10,329 --> 01:07:13,509
Heaven and Earth really
did trade places, yo.

878
01:07:13,534 --> 01:07:15,119
Fools, ya fool!

879
01:07:18,622 --> 01:07:19,623
I knew it!

880
01:07:19,832 --> 01:07:21,875
Even if Heaven and Earth flip over...

881
01:07:22,459 --> 01:07:24,161
A male is still a male and...

882
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:27,676
This is no time to be doing
an ecological survey!

883
01:07:28,257 --> 01:07:30,300
Calm down, Yamato.

884
01:07:30,634 --> 01:07:32,261
Remember, this is an S-rank mission.

885
01:07:33,855 --> 01:07:35,649
Something must have
happened outside.

886
01:07:36,286 --> 01:07:38,455
But we have to keep fooling him.

887
01:07:40,550 --> 01:07:42,720
We cannot allow those two
to leave this place.

888
01:07:43,981 --> 01:07:45,691
We have to deal with it ourselves.

889
01:07:57,492 --> 01:08:01,371
Kabuto, you search for
the Eight and Nine-Tails. Hmm...

890
01:08:02,249 --> 01:08:05,669
I'll handle those guys.
I owe them nothing less.

891
01:08:06,530 --> 01:08:07,990
Fine, let's do that.

892
01:08:14,528 --> 01:08:15,529
Deidara!

893
01:08:16,513 --> 01:08:18,098
You shall feel my wrath.

894
01:08:18,605 --> 01:08:21,358
Damn it, the geezer's snapped.

895
01:08:21,867 --> 01:08:23,869
You haven't forgotten, have you?

896
01:08:29,501 --> 01:08:31,670
<i>This is getting bad!</i>

897
01:08:32,237 --> 01:08:35,324
<i>Don't tell me he's going right
to his Particle Style?! Hmm!</i>

898
01:08:36,033 --> 01:08:37,743
<i>Things are starting to get out of hand.</i>

899
01:08:39,713 --> 01:08:41,006
I won't let you get away!

900
01:08:42,247 --> 01:08:44,114
What are you doing, Akatsuchi?!

901
01:08:44,612 --> 01:08:47,615
If you do that, you'll end up
killing turtle island!

902
01:08:50,005 --> 01:08:51,131
Damn!

903
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:52,679
This is complicated!

904
01:08:53,181 --> 01:08:55,475
It's so large that it just looks
like a landscape!

905
01:08:56,553 --> 01:08:59,640
<i>There's my chance! Hmm!</i>

906
01:09:03,435 --> 01:09:04,219
<i>Katsu!</i>

907
01:09:06,897 --> 01:09:07,981
Old man!

908
01:09:20,398 --> 01:09:22,192
Akatsuchi's Golem!

909
01:09:22,704 --> 01:09:25,582
Still attached to the Tsuchikage I see...

910
01:09:26,125 --> 01:09:27,584
What a nuisance! Hmm!

911
01:09:28,085 --> 01:09:30,504
<i>I should get him away
from this island.</i>

912
01:09:38,971 --> 01:09:40,264
That damn snake!

913
01:09:47,296 --> 01:09:50,299
So that guy over there is
the one controlling the snake!

914
01:09:50,774 --> 01:09:52,401
The nerve of that wimp.

915
01:09:52,401 --> 01:09:54,403
He was just pretending to
be Orochimaru's henchman!

916
01:10:04,663 --> 01:10:08,417
I see...
So Naruto is inside this turtle.

917
01:10:09,523 --> 01:10:12,526
Now then, how do I get in?

918
01:10:22,356 --> 01:10:24,695
Damn it! What's going on outside?!

919
01:10:29,938 --> 01:10:34,851
Th-There've been
a lot of tremors today...

920
01:10:34,975 --> 01:10:36,768
Y-You're right.

921
01:10:37,112 --> 01:10:39,031
Still, this is too weird.

922
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:41,529
Can the world turn upside down?

923
01:10:42,201 --> 01:10:45,120
Well, it seems to be possible
on this island.

924
01:10:45,496 --> 01:10:47,781
Although it's an extremely rare event.

925
01:10:49,833 --> 01:10:51,543
Oh really?

926
01:10:52,858 --> 01:10:55,652
I think I'm going to take
a look outside!

927
01:10:56,048 --> 01:11:00,510
No! You're on
an important S-rank mission,

928
01:11:00,795 --> 01:11:02,922
so stay focused!

929
01:11:03,347 --> 01:11:04,907
Yeah, well...

930
01:11:04,932 --> 01:11:07,142
I'm just going to take
a quick look outside.

931
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:11,805
It is a ninja's duty to see through
his mission until completion!

932
01:11:12,064 --> 01:11:17,110
And this is a mission
only you can accomplish!

933
01:11:17,585 --> 01:11:18,962
That's why you were selected.

934
01:11:18,987 --> 01:11:20,614
Do you understand, Naruto?

935
01:11:22,141 --> 01:11:24,059
We will see what's going on outside.

936
01:11:24,449 --> 01:11:26,827
That's about the only way
we can contribute here.

937
01:11:27,412 --> 01:11:29,623
However, let me repeat.

938
01:11:29,648 --> 01:11:32,567
You are on a crucial S-rank mission!

939
01:11:33,307 --> 01:11:37,019
<i>Even Naruto is beginning
to sense something.</i>

940
01:11:37,339 --> 01:11:39,967
<i>We bluffed him into thinking
this is an S-rank mission.</i>

941
01:11:40,954 --> 01:11:45,065
<i>But basically, he's just checking
to see if the animals are male or female.</i>

942
01:11:46,139 --> 01:11:47,933
<i>Naruto's not an idiot.</i>

943
01:11:48,225 --> 01:11:49,643
<i>He might have already
figured it out.</i>

944
01:11:49,668 --> 01:11:51,253
Okay, I understand!

945
01:11:51,937 --> 01:11:54,147
I'm going to focus on my mission!

946
01:11:55,065 --> 01:11:57,150
<i>All right!
This is going to work out!</i>

947
01:11:57,359 --> 01:11:58,902
<i>Thank goodness he's so dense!</i>

948
01:12:05,158 --> 01:12:06,201
<i>You're too slow!</i>

949
01:12:06,544 --> 01:12:08,463
<i>Corrosion Style: Quicklime Jutsu!</i>

950
01:12:20,273 --> 01:12:21,524
There they are.

951
01:12:23,343 --> 01:12:24,344
Is that him?!

952
01:12:24,469 --> 01:12:26,096
There should be five humans!

953
01:12:27,097 --> 01:12:28,432
<i>So Aoba is here too.</i>

954
01:12:29,933 --> 01:12:31,685
Don't come crawling out!

955
01:12:32,311 --> 01:12:33,937
Didn't we say that
we'd take care of this?

956
01:12:34,666 --> 01:12:36,376
<i>Having said that...</i>

957
01:12:40,694 --> 01:12:46,199
Perfect timing.
You can take me to Naruto.

958
01:12:50,078 --> 01:12:50,850
A snake...

959
01:12:51,232 --> 01:12:54,903
And that voice.
Don't tell me you're...

960
01:12:59,004 --> 01:13:01,131
We meet again, Yamato.

961
01:13:03,258 --> 01:13:04,468
I'll sweep him your way!

962
01:13:04,634 --> 01:13:05,635
So get him!

963
01:13:06,970 --> 01:13:09,056
<i>Water Style: Water Trumpet!</i>

964
01:13:10,265 --> 01:13:11,014
Nice!

965
01:13:14,944 --> 01:13:16,446
No good! He had it figured out!

966
01:13:18,190 --> 01:13:20,734
<i>I told you guys to get him, but...</i>

967
01:13:21,202 --> 01:13:22,203
<i>I got him!</i>

968
01:13:23,195 --> 01:13:24,196
This is...

969
01:13:26,365 --> 01:13:27,491
I see...

970
01:13:28,230 --> 01:13:31,275
Idiot! Now you can't move!

971
01:13:32,954 --> 01:13:36,958
<i>My Quicklime Jutsu is like
fast-acting cement.</i>

972
01:13:37,687 --> 01:13:40,187
<i>I spread it around
an area with water...</i>

973
01:13:40,212 --> 01:13:43,590
<i>making it cause a reaction
that makes it harden like cement.</i>

974
01:13:47,135 --> 01:13:48,136
Motoi, Aoba!

975
01:13:48,845 --> 01:13:50,097
Don't step into that water.

976
01:13:58,230 --> 01:13:59,731
That's for extra insurance!

977
01:14:01,942 --> 01:14:04,277
All right! You're ours!

978
01:14:04,903 --> 01:14:06,405
I'll extract intel out of you!

979
01:14:10,195 --> 01:14:13,365
<i>The geezer is faster than
he was in his prime!</i>

980
01:14:14,170 --> 01:14:18,216
You've always snuck around
and fought from a distance.

981
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:20,043
I never liked that about you!

982
01:14:20,794 --> 01:14:21,795
Shut up!

983
01:14:22,212 --> 01:14:25,048
<i>I'll finish him off with my C4...
Hmm!</i>

984
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:31,287
They're too fast! I can't keep up!

985
01:14:35,737 --> 01:14:37,447
Kabuto, how you've fallen.

986
01:14:37,853 --> 01:14:40,230
You've become just like Orochimaru.

987
01:14:40,513 --> 01:14:42,232
Aoba, concentrate!

988
01:14:42,691 --> 01:14:45,026
Yeah, I know. I'm okay.

989
01:14:51,908 --> 01:14:52,909
He's molted?!

990
01:14:53,183 --> 01:14:54,434
He's gone that far?

991
01:14:56,663 --> 01:14:57,789
Motoi, get away!

992
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:02,461
Yamato!

993
01:15:03,712 --> 01:15:04,713
Damn it!

994
01:15:06,089 --> 01:15:09,843
<i>Lucky for me, Kurotsuchi, I knew
the hand signs for your jutsu.</i>

995
01:15:10,552 --> 01:15:12,888
<i>I was able to
put you all off guard.</i>

996
01:15:28,987 --> 01:15:30,947
<i>This should be high enough.</i>

997
01:15:34,576 --> 01:15:36,453
Don't underestimate me,
old geezer!

998
01:15:42,876 --> 01:15:45,045
Prepare to die, Deidara!

999
01:15:45,212 --> 01:15:46,671
Let's see which one is real art,

1000
01:15:46,713 --> 01:15:49,549
your Particle Style or
my Explosion Style!

1001
01:15:51,301 --> 01:15:52,302
This is—?!

1002
01:15:52,344 --> 01:15:53,345
What?!

1003
01:15:53,386 --> 01:15:55,305
Right when we were getting
to the good part! Hmm!

1004
01:15:56,598 --> 01:15:57,599
Damn!

1005
01:16:00,393 --> 01:16:01,394
I can't move!

1006
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:02,771
Hold on!

1007
01:16:03,313 --> 01:16:05,649
When the kid from Hidden Rock returns,
she'll free you!

1008
01:16:07,644 --> 01:16:09,187
You're... Lord Tsuchikage!

1009
01:16:09,813 --> 01:16:12,358
Deidara got away.
What about you guys?

1010
01:16:13,635 --> 01:16:16,280
Someone from
the Hidden Rock went after him.

1011
01:16:18,427 --> 01:16:20,273
Damn it. Yamato's been...

1012
01:16:21,414 --> 01:16:22,499
What happened?

1013
01:16:23,917 --> 01:16:28,446
The Wood Style user and the Nine-Tails'
guardian, Yamato, has been taken.

1014
01:16:30,590 --> 01:16:33,343
He didn't bother going after
the Eight or Nine-Tails.

1015
01:16:33,967 --> 01:16:36,594
We don't know if he wanted
a hostage to interrogate...

1016
01:16:36,619 --> 01:16:39,789
or if the Wood Style user himself
was the target.

1017
01:16:42,461 --> 01:16:46,257
But the problem is the intel that
can be gleaned from Yamato!

1018
01:16:46,817 --> 01:16:50,037
Yamato would never break down
to reveal intel that easily!

1019
01:16:50,443 --> 01:16:52,279
That's not what I meant.

1020
01:16:58,232 --> 01:17:01,736
If our foe is Madara, he will
have formidable visual power.

1021
01:17:02,539 --> 01:17:04,874
Once someone is caught
under his ocular jutsu,

1022
01:17:04,916 --> 01:17:06,334
there is no escape.

1023
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:16,799
This present you brought is very
different from what I expected.

1024
01:17:18,249 --> 01:17:20,084
You're right.

1025
01:17:20,531 --> 01:17:22,784
But he is
the Nine-Tails' guardian

1026
01:17:22,809 --> 01:17:24,603
and he also possesses
highly classified intel.

1027
01:17:25,342 --> 01:17:29,329
Furthermore, I can use him to make
Zetsu and the others much stronger.

1028
01:17:30,009 --> 01:17:35,097
Instead of pushing my luck, I
decided to settle by just capturing him.

1029
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:37,699
This works out better for you guys.

1030
01:17:38,285 --> 01:17:39,995
Then hurry up and do it.

1031
01:17:40,702 --> 01:17:46,666
This left eye of mine
is itching to battle.
