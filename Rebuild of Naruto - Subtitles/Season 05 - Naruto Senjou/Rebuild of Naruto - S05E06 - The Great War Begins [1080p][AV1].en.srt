1
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:13,930
I can't believe it.

2
00:00:14,365 --> 00:00:19,662
I know. I never knew that
Lord Tsuchikage could be so crazy.

3
00:00:23,049 --> 00:00:26,469
Damn it... I'm going to strain
my back again!

4
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:28,296
Are you sure about this?

5
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:29,946
Wouldn't it be better to
go by sea?

6
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,491
Also, we don't have to fly
so high, do we?

7
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:35,670
Don't be ridiculous, Akatsuchi!

8
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,329
That giant snake might
sense us again!

9
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,966
We're almost there.

10
00:00:51,964 --> 00:00:54,424
The world flipped over again.

11
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,307
What's happening on
this island anyway?

12
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,161
Captain Yamato went to check
what's going on outside,

13
00:01:00,186 --> 00:01:01,870
but he hasn't come back.

14
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,697
Don't you think
something happened?

15
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,668
We're already looking into that.

16
00:01:09,976 --> 00:01:11,353
You don't have to worry about it.

17
00:01:12,036 --> 00:01:14,289
My mission here is done!

18
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,410
I'm going back to the Hidden
Leaf Village to wait for Sasuke!

19
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:22,373
He and I... made an oath.

20
00:01:26,058 --> 00:01:27,059
Not yet?

21
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:30,590
<i>Not yet. Just sit still.</i>

22
00:01:30,684 --> 00:01:32,692
The next time you use your eyes,

23
00:01:32,935 --> 00:01:35,313
you'll see a completely
different world.

24
00:01:35,384 --> 00:01:37,303
This is going to be fun!

25
00:01:38,606 --> 00:01:41,150
I couldn't care less about your war.

26
00:01:42,093 --> 00:01:44,595
The one who will destroy
the Hidden Leaf... is me.

27
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:51,903
Anko, please rest a little.
You've been working nonstop.

28
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:54,793
War is at our doorstep.

29
00:01:55,335 --> 00:01:59,214
So we have to gather as
much intel as possible.

30
00:02:00,171 --> 00:02:02,806
Especially if our intel
can save our comrades.

31
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:03,636
They're here!

32
00:02:09,635 --> 00:02:10,720
<i>You're kidding, right?!</i>

33
00:02:11,233 --> 00:02:13,443
The white snake that
crawled in earlier...

34
00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:16,092
That chakra... is Kabuto's.

35
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,138
This is the hideout, after all.

36
00:02:18,745 --> 00:02:20,747
I sent my insects to investigate.

37
00:02:20,942 --> 00:02:23,569
They've sensed significant
signs of life underground.

38
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,771
Tokuma, down below!
Towards four o'clock!

39
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:29,399
Your Byakugan will be able
to perceive what's down there!

40
00:02:29,925 --> 00:02:31,067
Please, Tokuma!

41
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,280
<i>Byakugan!</i>

42
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,689
Th-This is...

43
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,378
What do you see, Tokuma?!

44
00:02:52,156 --> 00:02:54,575
Ranka! Prepare to contact
Headquarters!

45
00:02:55,994 --> 00:02:57,579
So many of them...

46
00:03:06,456 --> 00:03:10,571
How come the animals get
to go outside, but I can't?!

47
00:03:11,432 --> 00:03:14,794
Impatient Naruto...
Haste makes waste...

48
00:03:15,385 --> 00:03:18,131
You still haven't mastered
Tailed Beast chakra control.

49
00:03:18,404 --> 00:03:21,407
While you're training,
I shall personally patrol...

50
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:22,816
When we are done,

51
00:03:22,841 --> 00:03:25,844
Tailed Beast chakra will feel
like an extension of you...

52
00:03:26,176 --> 00:03:28,512
They'll feel like your arms and legs,
it's true...

53
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,755
Yeaaahh!

54
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,465
Whoa...

55
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,967
With your Tailed Beast chakra...
Catch them!

56
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,054
Stack 'em up like building blocks...

57
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,805
Using your chakra and
the Tailed Beast's...

58
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:43,848
Balance those rocks!

59
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,902
<i>He took the bait!
Nice work, Bee!</i>

60
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:00,823
Try it out.

61
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:08,665
All right. I have to use
the Nine-Tails' chakra, right?

62
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,838
<i>I have to stack up these rocks
so that they don't tumble, right?</i>

63
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,926
All right! I'll do it!

64
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:30,311
Don't be reckless there.
Your control is fair.

65
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:33,319
But you don't have
fine-tuned control.

66
00:04:34,244 --> 00:04:38,082
<i>He pulverized the rock.
Is it too hard to grasp?</i>

67
00:04:38,564 --> 00:04:40,129
Damn it!

68
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,781
One more time!

69
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,911
<i>Gently... this time...</i>

70
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,836
<i>More gently...</i>

71
00:04:55,124 --> 00:04:57,960
Put spirit in... leave power out.

72
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,264
All right!

73
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,851
Don't get all satisfied with just one...
Or you'll never get done!

74
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,687
The first one is always easy... The
next one is key and it won't be so breezy.

75
00:05:12,941 --> 00:05:17,070
<i>Great, Bee! This will buy us
plenty of time.</i>

76
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:26,701
The time has come.

77
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:31,122
It seems that old Fence Sitter
brought them here safely.

78
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:34,958
We'll hide Turtle Island along
with Bee and the Nine-Tails

79
00:05:34,983 --> 00:05:36,651
at the rear of our headquarters.

80
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,423
Any objections, Princess Tsunade?

81
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,133
Fine.

82
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:46,480
I will go and
welcome Lord Tsuchikage.

83
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:59,359
Don't fall. Stay put... stay put.

84
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,239
– <i>That was so close!</i>
– Damn it!

85
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,533
– <i>Turtle Island just shook.</i>
– One more time!

86
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,370
<i>Does that mean we've reached
our destination?</i>

87
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,086
Ouch! My back!

88
00:06:18,304 --> 00:06:20,222
That's because you overdid it!

89
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,091
Welcome back, Lord Tsuchikage.

90
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,133
So what is the situation?

91
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,763
Both the Eight and
Nine-Tails are fine.

92
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,892
But the Wood Style User that was
guarding the Nine-Tails was taken.

93
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,187
Taken? Not taken down?

94
00:06:36,872 --> 00:06:40,160
Then the enemy will learn
everything about us!

95
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:44,153
At any rate,
I'll go over the details inside!

96
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,959
Will you hurry up and start
making Zetsu stronger?

97
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:02,964
Before that, extracting intel
from Yamato takes priority.

98
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,800
But please don't kill him.

99
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,263
So it's better to keep him alive
to make Zetsu stronger?

100
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:12,557
Yes.

101
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:17,437
<i>Poison, huh?</i>

102
00:07:17,696 --> 00:07:20,491
<i>So that's how he's suppressing
the power of the Wood Style.</i>

103
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,316
<i>Damn that Kabuto.</i>

104
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:25,319
<i>He has researched the cells of
Hashirama quite thoroughly.</i>

105
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:30,283
It's a drug I made to
curtail Hashirama's power.

106
00:07:30,732 --> 00:07:33,818
Don't worry,
I won't use it on the Zetsu.

107
00:07:35,574 --> 00:07:37,849
<i>I can't move. Damn it!</i>

108
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:41,461
<i>I can't even execute
my own decisions like this!</i>

109
00:07:43,237 --> 00:07:45,447
<i>At this rate... Damn it!</i>

110
00:07:46,326 --> 00:07:47,965
<i>Forgive me, everyone!</i>

111
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:52,234
We don't need the power
of the Rinnegan.

112
00:07:52,502 --> 00:07:54,045
With my truth serum...

113
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:58,116
and your Sharingan, we can
glean all the intel we want.

114
00:07:58,818 --> 00:08:00,361
If we learn who the enemy is,

115
00:08:00,386 --> 00:08:04,932
we can strike them by sending out
their worst enemy.

116
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,322
There's no need to waste chakra.

117
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:21,722
Huh?!

118
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,586
That's the Hidden Leaf's!

119
00:08:23,725 --> 00:08:25,143
It must be new intel!

120
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,464
Retrieve it!

121
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:31,385
The X marks the enemy's hideout.

122
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,930
It's known as
the Mountain Graveyard.

123
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:35,911
If we go by land,
we'll pass through

124
00:08:35,936 --> 00:08:38,063
the Hidden Steam Village and
the Hidden Frost Village.

125
00:08:38,348 --> 00:08:41,810
Advise the nations of Hidden Steam
and Hidden Frost to evacuate!

126
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,191
According to reports by
the Infiltration and Recon Unit,

127
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,026
the enemy is roughly
100,000 strong.

128
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,555
When one considers mobilizing
a regiment of that size,

129
00:08:49,652 --> 00:08:52,655
I think only a fraction of them
will come by sea.

130
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,667
We'll be in a bind
if they surround us.

131
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:59,455
Then it'll all comes down to
who makes the first move!

132
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,542
Convene the Ambush Unit immediately!

133
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:08,464
Have the main regiment run
through its formations!

134
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:09,665
Yes sir!

135
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,760
Make sure the Medical Unit
is well supplied

136
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,595
with medical ninja tools!

137
00:09:15,165 --> 00:09:19,085
Shikaku, help the Intel Unit check
their chain of communication.

138
00:09:19,641 --> 00:09:20,642
Roger.

139
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,522
Contact Ao and the Sensory Unit.
Have them hurry!

140
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,001
Y-Yes.

141
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,698
Tsuchikage, these were finished
while you were away.

142
00:09:33,758 --> 00:09:35,843
Oh! So they're done!

143
00:09:36,324 --> 00:09:37,325
Take it.

144
00:09:37,599 --> 00:09:41,060
Headbands for
the Allied Shinobi Forces, eh?

145
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,097
Nice work!

146
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,668
I came up with the design.

147
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,588
Former enemies who once
battled each other

148
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,798
are now one shinobi force!

149
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,636
Furthermore, shinobi and samurai
have joined forces.

150
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,622
The time is near!

151
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,020
– Next!
– Yes!

152
00:10:11,655 --> 00:10:14,116
I am Kankuro of the Sand,

153
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,698
appointed captain of
the Ambush Unit.

154
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,908
Kankuro, you say?

155
00:10:18,735 --> 00:10:20,362
What should be your nickname?

156
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,246
Huh?!

157
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,415
<i>Is that wise?</i>

158
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,126
<i>Naming someone so young
the captain...</i>

159
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,702
<i>What if... what if...</i>

160
00:10:29,727 --> 00:10:33,606
<i>Because of his inexperience,
he messes up and panics</i>

161
00:10:33,868 --> 00:10:37,372
<i>and forces me to become
the acting captain...</i>

162
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:39,423
<i>Oh man, what'll I do?!</i>

163
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,266
The headbands have been distributed!

164
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,727
Medical supplies have been checked!

165
00:10:45,965 --> 00:10:49,802
My name is Shizune and
I have been appointed to lead this unit.

166
00:10:50,336 --> 00:10:51,901
Good to meet you all.

167
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:56,072
First, there is something I want
all of you to remember.

168
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,116
This one is not food!

169
00:11:01,896 --> 00:11:03,397
You're Inoichi, right?

170
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,096
And you are?

171
00:11:05,121 --> 00:11:08,291
I'm Tenga! I've heard
so much about you!

172
00:11:08,713 --> 00:11:10,965
Please let me put you
on videotape and...

173
00:11:11,668 --> 00:11:13,086
I'm sorry I'm late.

174
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:17,179
I heard...
What a rough time you had, Aoba.

175
00:11:18,007 --> 00:11:19,758
Yes, Yamato was...

176
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,474
But put that out of your mind now.

177
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,560
We, the Intel Unit, will oversee

178
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,396
all communication between units.

179
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:32,987
Intel must be transmitted
accurately and quickly!

180
00:11:33,661 --> 00:11:37,206
In order to do that,
we must maintain calm at all times,

181
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,240
no matter what we hear!

182
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,157
Understand?!

183
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,242
– Yes!
– Yes!

184
00:11:42,758 --> 00:11:43,926
A war, huh?

185
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:48,879
Your name was Cee, right?
Is this your first war?!

186
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,251
Yes...

187
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,838
We are the "eyes" of
the Allied Shinobi Force.

188
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:58,259
Our unit's performance can greatly
change the tide of battle.

189
00:11:58,659 --> 00:12:00,369
Stay focused and alert.

190
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,098
I understand, Captain Ao!

191
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,135
Everyone, don't let down
your guard!

192
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,161
– Yes sir!
– Yes sir!

193
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:54,648
So... Who's our captain?

194
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,568
That spacey looking
guy over there.

195
00:13:01,372 --> 00:13:04,042
I-I'm starting to feel nervous.

196
00:13:04,957 --> 00:13:06,876
In war, stay calm...
and composed!

197
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,872
Hold on... my dad's Captain?!

198
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,499
<i>It's finally time!</i>

199
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,335
<i>With Kurotsuchi beside me,
I'll turn the tide of battle!</i>

200
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,755
Are you all right, Guy-sensei?

201
00:13:17,985 --> 00:13:21,523
The fighting hasn't started!
What did you do?

202
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,975
I'd better eat while I still can!

203
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,065
Gaara is the captain of
our Fourth Company,

204
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,681
but he's also
the commander-in-chief.

205
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:38,791
As his deputy, you're essentially
the captain of the Fourth Company.

206
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:40,800
Stay sharp!

207
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:45,366
What a bothersome assignment!

208
00:13:51,046 --> 00:13:54,725
Maybe I'll make a name for myself
in this war and become Hokage!

209
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,710
You fool...
Don't take war lightly!

210
00:13:57,334 --> 00:13:59,378
We have to avoid showing off.

211
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,508
You don't have to worry
about that, Shino...

212
00:14:07,585 --> 00:14:09,169
Now then, Gaara.

213
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,475
You are the commander-in-chief.

214
00:14:12,092 --> 00:14:14,177
Please address everyone
when you're ready.

215
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,480
<i>Summoning: Reanimation!</i>

216
00:14:57,058 --> 00:14:59,978
First, the former members
of the Akatsuki...

217
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:04,904
Itachi, Sasori, Deidara,
Kakuzu and Nagato.

218
00:15:06,248 --> 00:15:08,793
Then the former Jinchuriki...

219
00:15:08,924 --> 00:15:11,468
Yugito the Two-Tails,
Yagura the Three-Tails,

220
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,871
Roshi the Four-Tails,
Han the Five-Tails,

221
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,707
Utakata the Six-Tails and
Fuu the Seven-Tails.

222
00:15:16,817 --> 00:15:19,465
And the former Five Kage...

223
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:24,161
The Second Tsuchikage, the Third Raikage,
the Fourth Kazekage...

224
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:29,011
And Explosion Style Gari,
the Demon of the Mist, Zabuza...

225
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:32,750
Ice Style Haku,
Hanzo of the Salamander...

226
00:15:32,775 --> 00:15:36,361
Granny Chiyo of the Sand,
Kimimaro of the Kaguya Clan...

227
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:41,065
And from the Hidden Leaf...
Asuma Sarutobi, Dan, Hizashi Hyuga...

228
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:45,954
and a host of others
who had some skill.

229
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,113
And that's not all.

230
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:51,241
I used Yamato who has cells
from Hashirama.

231
00:15:51,927 --> 00:15:54,138
He adapted quite nicely.

232
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:05,993
100,000 White Zetsu empowered
by the best ninja of all time.

233
00:16:07,743 --> 00:16:08,786
Magnificent!

234
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,013
Let's go.

235
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,267
The Fourth Great Ninja War...

236
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:18,852
Begins!

237
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:00,954
They're on the move!

238
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,414
And there's a large
amount of them.

239
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,793
Join up with the main forces
and inform them of this!

240
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,046
I will remain here and
investigate the hideout!

241
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,196
It's too dangerous by yourself!

242
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:12,848
Quiet! Just go!

243
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,135
I'm aware of the risks!

244
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,879
But if we don't get word to them,

245
00:18:17,109 --> 00:18:19,111
our comrades will be
in greater danger!

246
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:44,020
Zabuza...

247
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:47,751
I know...
This isn't the afterlife.

248
00:18:48,365 --> 00:18:52,286
I'm totally conscious,
yet my body is moving on its own.

249
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:56,135
This is the Forbidden Jutsu...
the Reanimation Jutsu.

250
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:02,182
Someone summoned us
back to this world.

251
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,811
It means we're going to be
fighting from now on.

252
00:19:07,283 --> 00:19:09,410
Someone's taking advantage
of dead people, eh...

253
00:19:09,914 --> 00:19:13,668
I don't like being used
by any such person!

254
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:19,116
You will be our Commando Unit.

255
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:20,492
Go by air!

256
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:24,621
Sasori and Deidara will lay traps
and conduct enemy raids.

257
00:19:28,974 --> 00:19:31,019
Chukichi of the Hidden Mist and
the Leaf Foundation ninja,

258
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,713
your job will be sensory intel
and support.

259
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,342
What is... this?

260
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,553
You guys are with the Akatsuki.

261
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,392
Let me make this clear.
If you try to control us...

262
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:50,063
If Akatsuki has to rely on a wimp
like that to order us around,

263
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,222
they sure have fallen
on hard times.

264
00:19:52,588 --> 00:19:56,987
Not only that, the only survivor is Zetsu
and Tobi, the one who replaced me...

265
00:19:57,525 --> 00:20:00,611
For someone who preached that
"eternal beauty is art"...

266
00:20:01,172 --> 00:20:04,258
Don't talk so high and mighty
now that you're dead, Master. Hmmm!

267
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,706
And it's all because
of that humongous

268
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,625
weak spot stuck
on your chest, hmm!

269
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,961
Deidara, do you want me
to kill you?

270
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:17,049
I'm already dead.
And so are you, hmm.

271
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,886
Is this really going to work?

272
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,513
There are too many
reanimated shinobi

273
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:26,266
and it's difficult to
control them all.

274
00:20:26,901 --> 00:20:30,113
Right now, I'm just focusing
on the mobilization.

275
00:20:30,982 --> 00:20:33,193
Ultimately,
I will direct everything.

276
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,528
When the fighting begins,
I will erase their personalities

277
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,197
and turn them into
killing machines.

278
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,032
There's no need to worry.

279
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,785
Of course, it will depend
on their characteristics.

280
00:20:45,263 --> 00:20:47,432
Sometimes, it's better
not to change them.

281
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:51,012
Leaving their sentiments intact
will cause the enemy turmoil...

282
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,210
We'll aim for that weakness.

283
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,424
Aren't you Master Dan?

284
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:00,467
Yes...

285
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:03,387
What we share in common
is that we're dead.

286
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,682
We have been resurrected
by a Forbidden Jutsu...

287
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:09,184
summoned to inhabit
the bodies of living sacrifices.

288
00:21:09,884 --> 00:21:11,886
What is going on anyway?

289
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,191
<i>I have a bad feeling...</i>

290
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,945
Aren't you taking
Two-toned Zetsu?

291
00:21:21,105 --> 00:21:23,774
I'm leaving Zetsu to keep
an eye on Sasuke.

292
00:21:24,258 --> 00:21:26,343
I wouldn't put it past you
to look for the chance

293
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,036
to take him away
during the battle.

294
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:33,041
I'm having the 100,000 White Zetsu
travel underground...

295
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,128
Such a large army would
only attract attention.

296
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,047
Then we shall set out too.

297
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,758
Now then, first...

298
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,728
– <i>Multiple Striking Shadow Snakes!</i>
– <i>Multiple Striking Shadow Snakes!</i>

299
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:56,456
Just because you
have a Curse Mark,

300
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,735
you think you're like
Lord Orochimaru, Anko Mitarashi!

301
00:22:00,044 --> 00:22:01,314
I could say the same about you!

302
00:22:01,339 --> 00:22:04,175
Have you taken over as
the leader, Kabuto Yakushi?!

303
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:12,039
Taijutsu from a bookworm
will not work on me!

304
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:15,375
Wha—?!

305
00:22:24,948 --> 00:22:27,992
I have no intention of
fighting you with taijutsu.

306
00:22:29,917 --> 00:22:31,585
I'm a bookworm.

307
00:22:33,316 --> 00:22:36,736
<i>Poison? Me?
With all the antibodies that I have?</i>

308
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:41,151
So who is the lord now?

309
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:44,488
The antibody that
Lord Orochimaru developed

310
00:22:44,513 --> 00:22:46,223
will not work against
this poison.

311
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,045
It's... over... there...

312
00:23:01,034 --> 00:23:03,036
Kabuto was right.

313
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,093
At two o'clock... I see three.

314
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,056
What's wrong?

315
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,432
Muta! Ranka!

316
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:13,975
You two, hurry on!

317
00:23:14,289 --> 00:23:15,958
I will stall them!

318
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,187
The intel!

319
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,398
Get the intel to Headquarters!

320
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:40,919
And how should we evacuate?

321
00:23:41,603 --> 00:23:43,730
Continue heading south from
the Land of Steam

322
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,545
into Hidden Leaf territory.

323
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,760
The north will likely
become a battlefield.

324
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,441
Hey, someone...

325
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,484
Yes, my lord.

326
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:09,698
It's taking quite long.

327
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,284
Please be patient for
just a while longer.

328
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,717
Can a young man manage as
the Commander-in-Chief?

329
00:24:28,915 --> 00:24:31,293
Lord Gaara is not your
average young man!

330
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:33,877
How dare you make such
ignorant assumptions!

331
00:24:35,249 --> 00:24:36,334
How am I supposed to know?

332
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,561
Until recently,
we were on opposite sides!

333
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:40,812
Right back at you!

334
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:44,065
It's not like we trust you either!

335
00:24:44,313 --> 00:24:46,346
So watch what you say!

336
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:48,640
To be honest,
I feel the same way.

337
00:24:48,953 --> 00:24:49,654
Right!

338
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:53,733
Huh?
What did you just say, Hoheto?

339
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,625
Even if Orochimaru
deceived them,

340
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:59,611
the Sand were behind the plot
to crush the Hidden Leaf.

341
00:25:00,312 --> 00:25:03,418
If it weren't for them,
Lord Hiruzen would still...

342
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:12,719
Look... We were lucky enough to
be named to the Commando Unit...

343
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,804
Things are just about to start...

344
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:17,643
I know that! I'm a shinobi too!

345
00:25:18,108 --> 00:25:20,968
I'm not about to oppose what our
nation and village have decided...

346
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,023
That was just
my personal opinion!

347
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,485
You Hidden Leaf
don't have the right...

348
00:25:29,219 --> 00:25:31,303
A rogue ninja from the Hidden Leaf
attacked Lord Killer Bee,

349
00:25:31,328 --> 00:25:34,074
as well as the Five Kage at their summit!

350
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,243
Are you willing to take responsibility

351
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,993
for the loss of
Lord Raikage's left hand?

352
00:25:38,365 --> 00:25:39,063
What?!

353
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:42,916
No one completely trusts
each other yet.

354
00:25:43,746 --> 00:25:44,914
It can't be helped.

355
00:25:45,788 --> 00:25:48,165
After years on opposing sides,

356
00:25:48,287 --> 00:25:50,706
you can't expect them
to bond in a day or two.

357
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,182
You Leaf bastard!

358
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,934
Want to do something about it,
Hidden Cloud?!

359
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:04,145
You're going to betray us
again anyway, right, Hidden Stone?

360
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,772
Are the Mist just all talk?

361
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,816
If you have a complaint,
say it with your fists!

362
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,486
You're the one who needs to
watch what he says!

363
00:26:11,795 --> 00:26:12,796
What?!

364
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:13,405
Want to fight?

365
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:17,158
Sure! You Sand killed my father!

366
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,494
I'd be glad to kill you right here!

367
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,704
Hey, stop!

368
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:25,875
Huh?!

369
00:26:34,216 --> 00:26:36,802
In the name of gain and profit
for one's nation and village...

370
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:40,515
Shinobi have hated and hurt
each other for many years,

371
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:44,311
from the First to the Third
Great Ninja Wars.

372
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:48,732
That hatred cried out for power,
and thus, I was born.

373
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,695
In the past, I too was
hatred and power...

374
00:26:53,981 --> 00:26:55,358
I was a Jinchuriki.

375
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:59,450
And I hated this world
and the humans in it

376
00:26:59,475 --> 00:27:01,060
and thought about
destroying them.

377
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:05,531
This is exactly what the Akatsuki
is trying to do now.

378
00:27:11,293 --> 00:27:15,381
However... a single shinobi from
the Hidden Leaf stopped me.

379
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:37,656
He cried for me, his enemy!

380
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,868
We wounded each other in battle,
but he called me his friend!

381
00:27:43,552 --> 00:27:45,262
He saved me!

382
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:49,501
We were enemies,
but we were both Jinchuriki...

383
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,838
When we share and
experience the same pain,

384
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,423
there can be no bad blood!

385
00:27:59,347 --> 00:28:01,307
No one is an enemy here!

386
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:06,184
Because we all bear the pain of
having been hurt by the Akatsuki.

387
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:08,593
Now, there is only...

388
00:28:09,853 --> 00:28:10,854
... shinobi!

389
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,528
If you still cannot
forgive the Sand,

390
00:28:16,805 --> 00:28:20,184
after this war is over,
you can have my head!

391
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,415
<i>The look in everyone's faces
has changed.</i>

392
00:28:30,204 --> 00:28:34,292
The enemy is now after
my friend who saved me!

393
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,632
If he falls into enemy hands,
this world is finished!

394
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,093
I want to protect my friend!

395
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,638
And I want to protect this world!

396
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:46,015
But I am much too young,

397
00:28:46,256 --> 00:28:49,176
too inexperienced to
protect this world!

398
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:53,565
So I beg you all to
lend me your strength!

399
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,443
You got it, Lord Gaara!

400
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,827
Sorry about that...

401
00:29:05,968 --> 00:29:07,970
No... I was wrong too.

402
00:29:08,678 --> 00:29:10,268
Sorry... I said too much.

403
00:29:10,805 --> 00:29:12,599
I apologize too.

404
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,130
<i>The more passionate they are,</i>

405
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,132
<i>the stronger the bond
that is forged...</i>

406
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:21,843
<i>Right, Gaara?</i>

407
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,764
You have to hand it
to Lord Gaara!

408
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,307
Lord Gaara!

409
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,642
<i>You've become
a fine man... Gaara!</i>

410
00:29:30,753 --> 00:29:33,464
So now, we're all comrades.

411
00:29:34,081 --> 00:29:38,585
It's a nuisance, but I guess we
have to learn all their scents!

412
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:41,038
The reputation of
the Inuzuka nose is on the line.

413
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:47,744
All who feel as I do!
Follow me!

414
00:30:00,756 --> 00:30:02,340
I did it!

415
00:30:04,256 --> 00:30:05,674
Not bad.

416
00:30:06,985 --> 00:30:09,265
Next up is the final lesson.

417
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,101
Sad, but true,
it's hard to proceed...

418
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,937
But we must move forward
with the deed.

419
00:30:58,078 --> 00:30:59,788
The Fourth Great Ninja War...

420
00:31:00,224 --> 00:31:01,642
We will win!

421
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,111
That goes without saying!

422
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:04,487
We will!

423
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:39,898
<i>I really didn't want to
experience war in my lifetime.</i>

424
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,234
<i>What if...</i>

425
00:31:44,514 --> 00:31:46,891
<i>What if we suddenly come
under a surprise attack</i>

426
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:49,450
<i>and I'm the sole survivor...</i>

427
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:55,506
Omoi!

428
00:31:57,419 --> 00:31:58,504
Hey, Omoi!

429
00:31:59,277 --> 00:32:00,320
Are you listening?

430
00:32:01,136 --> 00:32:02,554
We're going to enter

431
00:32:02,886 --> 00:32:04,512
the airspace above enemy territory.

432
00:32:04,598 --> 00:32:05,485
Stay alert!

433
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:07,508
Sir...

434
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:10,437
Can I ask you something?

435
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,430
What is it?

436
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:16,267
You and I aren't too far apart
in age, Captain.

437
00:32:17,888 --> 00:32:20,975
This is your first war, right?

438
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:22,674
Yeah...

439
00:32:24,531 --> 00:32:26,867
Are you nervous?

440
00:32:35,295 --> 00:32:36,254
Listen up!

441
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:38,706
The outcome of this war will depend

442
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:41,042
on the success or failure of
our Commando Unit.

443
00:32:41,342 --> 00:32:42,885
The number of casualties
depends on us, too.

444
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,547
Think only about success!

445
00:32:47,508 --> 00:32:49,635
If you want to protect
your family and friends!

446
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,884
They've been bombing indiscriminately
with the detonating clay.

447
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,840
We have to put more distance
between us!

448
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:38,933
They're still coming after us.

449
00:33:39,524 --> 00:33:41,193
I'll increase the power
of the jutsu.

450
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:50,028
You irritating bugs, hmm!

451
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:57,994
Stop hiding all over the place.
Such a pain.

452
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:07,013
The insects are disrupting
my sensory chakra.

453
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:10,715
It's a jamming jutsu using insects.

454
00:34:11,196 --> 00:34:14,282
They're good enough to be
an infiltration and reconnaissance unit.

455
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:17,972
However, don't underestimate
this artful duo!

456
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,559
If they're attacking with insects,
we'll answer with this.

457
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,654
They are swarming!

458
00:34:43,818 --> 00:34:46,279
I got separated from Ranka...

459
00:34:57,188 --> 00:34:59,149
I'm counting on you.

460
00:35:02,098 --> 00:35:05,852
I must join up
with the main regiment.

461
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:17,990
Gather round.

462
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,746
We're in enemy territory.

463
00:35:24,536 --> 00:35:27,247
We're going to set up
a base camp here.

464
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:32,255
And we'll conduct surprise attacks
and set traps!

465
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,634
Keep a ten-meter radius!

466
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:39,220
The exit points will be at
two and six o'clock!

467
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:41,013
Omoi!

468
00:35:41,363 --> 00:35:44,825
Lay traps of paper bombs
in every other direction.

469
00:35:45,248 --> 00:35:45,961
Right...

470
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:49,814
Sai! Continue aerial surveillance!

471
00:35:50,305 --> 00:35:50,908
Roger.

472
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,901
Ittan, create trenches with
your Earth Style!

473
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:54,966
Will do.

474
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:58,322
Tango, put up the antenna for
the Chakra Communications.

475
00:35:58,698 --> 00:35:59,282
Right.

476
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,749
Zaji and Hoheto, you two will be
on sensory and watch duty.

477
00:36:01,774 --> 00:36:02,598
Got it.

478
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,705
Kiri and I will review
our plan of action.

479
00:36:06,136 --> 00:36:06,783
Understood.

480
00:36:09,517 --> 00:36:11,769
Kabuto uses one
of Orochimaru's ninjutsu

481
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,587
known as the Reanimation Jutsu.

482
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,840
According to the reports,

483
00:36:15,865 --> 00:36:18,784
corpses are brought back to life,
their souls held in bondage.

484
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:21,478
And they cannot be killed,
no matter how many times you attack.

485
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,777
Jutsu to seal the souls or
stop their movements

486
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:28,311
seems to be the only solution.

487
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:31,443
Furthermore, even if we manage
to kill the jutsu user...

488
00:36:31,468 --> 00:36:32,803
the jutsu itself can't be broken.

489
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:40,990
The goal of every unit will be
to find Kabuto and restrain him.

490
00:36:41,864 --> 00:36:45,451
After that, we will break
his troublesome jutsu with genjutsu.

491
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,538
That's what I understand.

492
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,185
First Company, with me!

493
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:28,829
This is a jamming jutsu.

494
00:37:30,729 --> 00:37:31,730
What's wrong?

495
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:35,378
I can't sense for sure because
of a jamming jutsu, but...

496
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:37,797
Something's coming.

497
00:37:53,177 --> 00:37:56,004
That's Muta!
I can tell by his chakra.

498
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,567
The one from the Aburame Clan

499
00:37:58,748 --> 00:38:00,081
who was with
the reconnaissance unit.

500
00:38:00,106 --> 00:38:01,358
Hey, wait!

501
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,657
It's booby trapped out there.
I'll bring him back.

502
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:07,868
Muta, are you all right?

503
00:38:08,545 --> 00:38:09,308
<i>Byakugan!</i>

504
00:38:12,327 --> 00:38:14,503
The insect bag on his back...

505
00:38:14,772 --> 00:38:16,732
They're not insects of
the Aburame Clan!

506
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,791
What?!

507
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:19,797
Zaji, get back here!

508
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,382
Be careful!

509
00:38:27,686 --> 00:38:29,772
They saw through it instantly.

510
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:37,356
Muta!

511
00:38:37,665 --> 00:38:39,833
I'm so sorry!
Everyone get out of here.

512
00:38:44,361 --> 00:38:46,279
– Do it, Deidara.
– I know.

513
00:38:48,572 --> 00:38:50,870
There's a white clump
that's packed with chakra

514
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,121
in the insect bag on Muta's back!

515
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,789
Ittan, do it!

516
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,742
<i>Earth Style: Mobile Core!</i>

517
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:19,482
Now that's art...
The Hidden Leaf in bits and pieces, hmm.

518
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:20,900
Make sure.

519
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:27,865
They're still there.

520
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,713
We couldn't save
the guy from the Aburame.

521
00:39:43,086 --> 00:39:44,087
Damn it.

522
00:39:44,444 --> 00:39:46,363
Kiri, tend to Zaji's wounds.

523
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:47,408
Right.

524
00:39:50,474 --> 00:39:54,520
Can't we even take a moment
to mourn our dead in war?

525
00:39:55,829 --> 00:39:57,021
Hey, don't move!

526
00:39:58,486 --> 00:40:00,634
Here they come again!
Stay alert!

527
00:40:03,037 --> 00:40:04,706
We don't even get
some time to think?!

528
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,833
What the hell.

529
00:40:07,858 --> 00:40:10,110
<i>Cloud Style:
Crescent Moon Slice!</i>

530
00:40:14,303 --> 00:40:15,372
They are...

531
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,124
Tokuma! Ranka!

532
00:40:18,878 --> 00:40:20,088
Our comrades again?!

533
00:40:20,444 --> 00:40:21,903
Are they being manipulated?!

534
00:40:24,356 --> 00:40:25,608
Again! Above us!

535
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,935
Nice, Sai!

536
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:38,310
We're keeping these guys alive.

537
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:41,740
You damn...

538
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:45,526
Now... what will you do, hmm?

539
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:51,090
You're playing dirty.

540
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,825
I won't forgive you!

541
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,786
Sasori, I know you're there.

542
00:40:56,765 --> 00:40:57,930
Come on out.

543
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:02,334
Hmm... You're a puppet master,
after all.

544
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:05,503
You're also a Commando Unit,
I take it.

545
00:41:06,181 --> 00:41:08,578
It's unusual for
two Commando Units

546
00:41:08,603 --> 00:41:10,146
to engage each other like this.

547
00:41:11,311 --> 00:41:14,190
The one who wins here will
succeed in a surprise attack.

548
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:17,433
We started this war.

549
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:20,968
And a victory here will determine
the course of the entire war, hmm!

550
00:41:21,138 --> 00:41:23,140
Then we'll win.

551
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,690
Is that so?

552
00:41:24,852 --> 00:41:27,105
Well, we cannot lose.

553
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,903
It's because...

554
00:41:30,909 --> 00:41:33,036
we're invincible, hmm!

555
00:41:36,181 --> 00:41:37,035
What's wrong?

556
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:38,602
Impossible...

557
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,083
Run away, little brother.

558
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:45,219
Our bodies are indestructible.

559
00:41:46,139 --> 00:41:47,682
There's no way you can win!

560
00:41:48,479 --> 00:41:50,174
Brother Shin.

561
00:41:51,385 --> 00:41:52,219
Brother?

562
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:56,388
What an emotional reunion, hmm!

563
00:41:57,269 --> 00:41:59,646
<i>They're intentionally pitting people
we know against us?</i>

564
00:42:00,947 --> 00:42:02,115
<i>How dirty!</i>

565
00:42:02,682 --> 00:42:06,273
Can't waste time feeling anxious.

566
00:42:06,805 --> 00:42:09,049
Trying to hurt our comrades...?

567
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:12,044
Well, I won't stand for it!

568
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:18,077
This is war! There's no room
for niceties here, hmm.

569
00:42:20,729 --> 00:42:22,346
Hoheto, Tango, go!

570
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,041
You're next, Ittan!

571
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,877
Brother, snap out of it!

572
00:42:29,807 --> 00:42:30,975
Nice moves.

573
00:42:31,088 --> 00:42:33,549
But even if you make contact,
nothing will happen.

574
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:38,514
<i>I must hand it to Master Sasori.</i>

575
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,267
<i>There's no need to
counter this, hmm!</i>

576
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:45,396
<i>Cloud Style: Back Slice!</i>

577
00:42:51,086 --> 00:42:52,614
Well done, Omoi!

578
00:42:54,862 --> 00:42:55,863
<i>No effect.</i>

579
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:58,314
<i>He pretended to
swing directly at me,</i>

580
00:42:58,339 --> 00:43:00,550
<i>but actually slashed back!</i>

581
00:43:01,565 --> 00:43:02,733
<i>So stupid!</i>

582
00:43:03,529 --> 00:43:05,948
Cutting my chakra threads...

583
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,960
What fine swordsmanship.

584
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,003
Over here!

585
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:17,344
Ittan, raise us up!

586
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:19,513
<i>Earth Style: Mobile Core!</i>

587
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,432
What?!

588
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:35,529
Why you—!

589
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:40,868
Attaching your threads to mine
and reeling me in...

590
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:47,166
Your thread-handling skills
have improved since last time, Kankuro.

591
00:43:47,884 --> 00:43:52,013
Frankly, it's nice to get praise
from a Red Secret Technique Master.

592
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:55,424
But my Black Secret Technique
is now superior to yours.

593
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,969
I never imagined
you'd still be alive.

594
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:03,223
Fate deemed that I would
fight you again.

595
00:44:04,025 --> 00:44:06,152
I owe you one for last time.

596
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,109
My own puppet, huh...

597
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:17,988
That body is worthless to me now.

598
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:23,452
Because now, I'm finally a real doll
that will never rot away!

599
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:26,413
This is the body that
I had always wished for!

600
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,041
Run...

601
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,047
Captain!
The guy from the Foundation...

602
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:37,425
He's got that clay inside his stomach!

603
00:44:41,202 --> 00:44:44,682
I once heard that Deidara's detonating
clay is weak against the Lightning Style.

604
00:44:44,893 --> 00:44:46,019
I still have a little...

605
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:49,603
Take Kiri and the injured
behind that rock!

606
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,980
Kiri, focus only on healing them!

607
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,116
<i>Too slow!</i>

608
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:03,617
<i>Now!</i>

609
00:45:03,793 --> 00:45:05,545
<i>Black Secret Technique: Salamander!</i>

610
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,207
Brother!

611
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,378
An explosion?!

612
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:19,133
In any case, our reinforcements
will crush the enemy.

613
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:21,760
Zaji! What's happening out there?!

614
00:45:22,187 --> 00:45:24,689
It's okay.
I can still read their chakra.

615
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,223
Everyone is alive!

616
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:33,147
Owww...

617
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,858
We're lucky to be alive.

618
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,113
The Salamander, eh...

619
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:45,576
So he surrounded the bomb with
a defensive puppet he had hidden.

620
00:45:46,395 --> 00:45:49,482
Because of that, the blast didn't
have much force, hmm.

621
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:53,375
You called him... a bomb...?

622
00:45:54,854 --> 00:45:56,641
You're going to complain about that?

623
00:45:57,549 --> 00:45:59,593
As long as his soul
clings to this world,

624
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,592
I can revive him as much as I want.

625
00:46:02,496 --> 00:46:04,665
I'll turn him into another bomb!

626
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:11,921
I...

627
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,522
Don't want to hurt you.

628
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:17,733
I died...

629
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:21,278
and was liberated from
the Foundation.

630
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:25,199
I've heard about the Foundation
of the Hidden Leaf.

631
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:29,036
You're raised together from
the time you are young,

632
00:46:29,061 --> 00:46:30,707
like siblings...

633
00:46:31,029 --> 00:46:33,766
Then in the end, they pit you
against each other in a death match.

634
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:36,084
It is a training system designed
to destroy your emotions.

635
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:39,296
Where there is no feeling,
there is no doubt.

636
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:43,091
That makes
a truly powerful shinobi.

637
00:46:43,613 --> 00:46:46,032
Deep down, you are just like me.

638
00:46:47,152 --> 00:46:49,946
Don't act like an artist just
because you can draw a little!

639
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:52,351
Art is an explosion!

640
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:55,020
I think it's time for
another big blast!

641
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:58,607
Just try it!

642
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:11,057
<i>I have a drawing
I want to show you, Brother.</i>

643
00:47:13,179 --> 00:47:14,347
<i>Really? Let's see it.</i>

644
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,166
<i>What is it?</i>

645
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,669
<i>I'm not finished yet...</i>

646
00:47:19,941 --> 00:47:21,234
<i>so can you wait a little longer?</i>

647
00:47:27,932 --> 00:47:28,892
<i>Secret Black Technique...</i>

648
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:37,479
Damn! I should have just
detonated myself earlier!

649
00:47:37,823 --> 00:47:41,708
It's so tacky to exhibit one's
ultimate art over and over!

650
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:42,901
But I guess I have no choice!

651
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:43,566
Hmm!

652
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:45,988
<i>Lightning Style?!</i>

653
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:49,950
<i>Triple Iron Maiden!</i>

654
00:47:58,750 --> 00:47:59,751
Nice job, Omoi!

655
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:04,756
I'll use my Puppet Jutsu
and keep these two tied up!

656
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:06,842
Do something about Sai's brother!

657
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:07,855
Right!

658
00:48:11,475 --> 00:48:14,686
I knew that if I remained
in the Foundation,

659
00:48:14,711 --> 00:48:17,088
I would have to face you in battle.

660
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,648
So let's settle now what
we couldn't back then.

661
00:48:21,979 --> 00:48:23,481
Settle that last match... huh?

662
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:35,829
However, it won't happen.

663
00:48:38,163 --> 00:48:38,935
Brother...

664
00:48:40,322 --> 00:48:41,808
So you finished it.

665
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:46,423
I finally got to see the picture
I longed to see...

666
00:48:48,343 --> 00:48:49,571
It's as though...

667
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:54,179
your drawing has freed
my soul from its bindings.

668
00:48:59,243 --> 00:49:03,163
Sai, these comrades who
call you by your name...

669
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:06,068
Cherish them.

670
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,239
<i>Thank you...</i>

671
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,703
What's going on?

672
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:19,456
<i>The strings are slack...</i>

673
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:21,583
Sasori...

674
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:25,295
The source of your power
lay in your soul.

675
00:49:27,189 --> 00:49:28,857
You once turned yourself into a puppet,

676
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:30,968
and tried to erase your soul,
but you couldn't do it.

677
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:36,098
I can feel it inside this puppet
that you made,

678
00:49:36,466 --> 00:49:38,141
where your undying soul dwells inside.

679
00:49:38,698 --> 00:49:41,618
But now, you are living flesh,

680
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,982
but that's merely a human shell that
has degenerated into a puppet.

681
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,268
You were a first-rate
shinobi puppet master.

682
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:52,197
Not some lowlife that allows
someone else to manipulate you.

683
00:49:54,531 --> 00:49:58,827
If I'm not mistaken,
you used Kabuto as a spy back then.

684
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:02,033
Now, he's the one using you.

685
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:05,752
It's over when a puppet master
is the one being manipulated!

686
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:09,548
And whether it's you, or Kabuto,
the one who is controlling you...

687
00:50:09,813 --> 00:50:11,648
There's no way I'm going to lose...

688
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:18,339
Because I am the ninja puppet master
of the real Sasori puppet!

689
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:25,355
Your techniques and the puppets
you created will never decay.

690
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:28,525
As long as there are
future puppet masters

691
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:30,819
to inherit the soul that
resides within them!

692
00:50:34,576 --> 00:50:38,580
So that is precisely
the true form of art I sought...

693
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,623
Quit joking around!

694
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:45,459
Master Sasori!

695
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:49,129
Don't pay any attention to this jerk, hmm!

696
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:51,882
Art is a single flash of light!

697
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:53,967
Art is an explosion!

698
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,636
Are you listening, Sasori?!

699
00:50:59,642 --> 00:51:02,395
<i>The soul of the creator
resides within, eh...</i>

700
00:51:03,044 --> 00:51:04,065
<i>You're right...</i>

701
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:06,688
Kankuro...

702
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:08,482
What is it?

703
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:17,115
I entrust you with the "Father"
and "Mother" puppets.

704
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:22,537
And when you die,
bestow them upon another...

705
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:24,873
Those two are...

706
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:27,793
Yeah... of course, I understand.

707
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:31,338
Hey! Master Sasori!

708
00:51:46,317 --> 00:51:49,493
This is a sacrificial victim...
What's going on?

709
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:53,902
I heard that one couldn't die
under the Reanimation Jutsu.

710
00:51:54,501 --> 00:51:56,716
Maybe Kabuto released the jutsu?

711
00:51:58,448 --> 00:51:59,908
Let me out, you bastard!

712
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:01,952
It doesn't seem that way.

713
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,912
– Hey, can't you hear me?
– Sasori is gone,

714
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,747
but the loud one is still here.

715
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:09,793
We thought the Reanimation Jutsu
had been perfected,

716
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,378
but it seems to have a flaw.

717
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:15,556
It's not that easy to control emotion.

718
00:52:17,792 --> 00:52:18,915
Looks like it's over.

719
00:52:19,121 --> 00:52:20,861
Nope... this is just the beginning!

720
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:22,889
Sai, Omoi, Zaji!

721
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:24,766
Head out for immediate ambush.

722
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:26,393
– Yes!
– Right!

723
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:37,103
What is it?

724
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:40,532
Oh, nothing.

725
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,535
<i>The Reanimation Jutsu...</i>

726
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:46,746
<i>There are still so many
mysteries behind it.</i>

727
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:49,799
<i>But I have a good idea of
how it works now.</i>

728
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:56,173
Madara, head out to the battlefront.

729
00:52:56,957 --> 00:52:59,725
I'll hide and focus on the jutsu.

730
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:03,930
<i>This woman...</i>

731
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,185
<i>She had gotten
this close to our hideout.</i>

732
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:10,854
<i>And Kabuto was aware of it.</i>

733
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:13,982
<i>So he purposely lured her here?</i>

734
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:16,693
<i>That damned Kabuto...</i>

735
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:18,820
<i>Since the beginning,</i>

736
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:21,656
<i>he's planned for the Allied Shinobi Force
and us to destroy each other.</i>

737
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:23,241
<i>But that won't happen.</i>

738
00:53:23,822 --> 00:53:25,449
<i>I'm the one who will use you.</i>

739
00:53:31,388 --> 00:53:32,930
Looks like that woman is still alive.

740
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:37,756
Lord Orochimaru's Curse Mark
has adapted to this woman...

741
00:53:37,998 --> 00:53:40,855
His chakra flows through her body now.

742
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:42,844
She can't be killed yet.

743
00:53:43,409 --> 00:53:45,786
No, get rid of her now.

744
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:50,602
This woman knows where
the real entrance to our hideout is.

745
00:53:51,925 --> 00:53:56,650
I need to extract Lord Orochimaru's
chakra while she is alive and collect it.

746
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:02,489
You might as well call
my body Lord Orochimaru's.

747
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:06,868
It's crucial in order to increase
my own strength.

748
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:10,121
Then my power to bind
the Reanimation Jutsu will increase.

749
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:14,376
And another crucial thing is...

750
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:18,338
This jutsu requires a live human body.

751
00:54:19,037 --> 00:54:21,915
That is why this woman is
being kept alive.

752
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,803
Increasing our battle strength...

753
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:27,889
Doesn't that further your cause?
Or am I wrong?

754
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:31,810
Today's friend is tomorrow's foe.
That may be so.

755
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:35,647
Your benefit could turn into
my disadvantage.

756
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:38,900
You still don't trust me, do you?

757
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:40,498
What do you want from me?

758
00:54:41,539 --> 00:54:43,233
Prove to me right now

759
00:54:43,759 --> 00:54:47,784
that the Reanimation Jutsu
really requires living bodies.

760
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:52,664
And... tell me all of its secrets.

761
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:54,791
Including how to stop it!

762
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:57,877
And if I refuse?

763
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:01,680
You will never acquire what
you desire and

764
00:55:01,712 --> 00:55:04,590
what you desire will become
something else...

765
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,845
It will be your life!

766
00:55:07,851 --> 00:55:10,896
<i>It's not wise to take on someone
who uses Rinnegan right now.</i>

767
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:13,351
<i>Well, I still have a hand to play.</i>

768
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:14,853
<i>No need to rush it.</i>

769
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:16,604
Fine...

770
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:19,441
But I don't have any sacrifices here.

771
00:55:21,852 --> 00:55:24,397
As I said,
this woman cannot be used.

772
00:55:30,462 --> 00:55:33,048
Those people are...?

773
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:35,957
Danzo's dogs.

774
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:41,296
They've been under a Sharingan-based
genjutsu from the time of their capture.

775
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:46,926
You don't go easy, do you?

776
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:50,430
All right, I got things ready for you.

777
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:52,807
I killed this one.

778
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:55,977
Now use this other one and
do the Reanimation Jutsu.

779
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:15,747
Let me say this first.

780
00:56:16,025 --> 00:56:18,315
This is categorized as
a type of Summoning Jutsu.

781
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:26,216
I summon the soul of the dead person
from the afterlife to this plane.

782
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:29,844
To achieve that, I need a portion
of the one I want to revive.

783
00:56:32,285 --> 00:56:34,412
A fixed portion of flesh.

784
00:56:35,377 --> 00:56:38,380
A portion that contains
their genetic information.

785
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:41,523
Without it, the Reanimation Jutsu
will not work.

786
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:44,050
Furthermore, if the soul is
not in the afterlife...

787
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:49,906
Meaning, if the soul has been sealed
somewhere else, they cannot be revived.

788
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:53,410
In the past,

789
00:56:53,789 --> 00:56:56,912
Lord Orochimaru tried to bring back
the Fourth Hokage and failed.

790
00:56:57,664 --> 00:57:00,367
That was because the god of death
had already taken the Hokage's soul

791
00:57:00,392 --> 00:57:02,627
with the sealing jutsu,
the Reaper Death Seal.

792
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,235
And the Third Hokage also
used the same jutsu

793
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:09,388
during the destruction of
Hidden Leaf Village.

794
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:31,156
The First and Second Hokage
were taken along too...

795
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:34,090
So that means...

796
00:57:34,115 --> 00:57:38,161
Reanimation Jutsu can't be used
on the First through Fourth Hokage?

797
00:57:38,711 --> 00:57:39,566
That's right...

798
00:57:41,444 --> 00:57:43,446
I've brought many back to life...

799
00:57:43,753 --> 00:57:47,005
But it wasn't easy to harvest
their genetic material.

800
00:57:47,967 --> 00:57:50,470
It's basically just grave robbing.

801
00:57:52,954 --> 00:57:55,248
It's hard to identify decaying bodies...

802
00:57:55,993 --> 00:57:58,120
I had a lot of failures.

803
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:00,602
So this is the jutsu formula?

804
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:20,371
This is how you turn a living person
into a vessel for the dead one's soul.

805
00:58:21,252 --> 00:58:23,462
Then the Reanimation Jutsu
is complete.

806
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,538
Th-This is...?!

807
00:58:29,742 --> 00:58:31,869
You can call this jutsu

808
00:58:31,905 --> 00:58:34,491
the most powerful jutsu
in the shinobi world.

809
00:58:35,224 --> 00:58:38,811
The Second Hokage devised it and
Lord Orochimaru perfected it.

810
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:41,184
It's their greatest legacy
to the world!

811
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,815
I control his personality with this tag.

812
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,819
And once I assign his orders...

813
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:55,365
All the abilities he had in life will
be restored to this decaying man.

814
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:58,952
And he will become my puppet who
obeys my orders and cannot die.

815
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:03,706
Naturally, even rare abilities like
the Rinnegan of the Six Paths

816
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:06,084
and Itachi's Sharingan.

817
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:10,797
But I could not find
Shisui Uchiha's body anywhere.

818
00:59:13,284 --> 00:59:14,911
Jiraiya's body is deep in the ocean

819
00:59:14,936 --> 00:59:17,397
where the pressure is too strong
for anyone to venture in.

820
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:21,391
As for Danzo's right eye
and Pain of the Six Paths,

821
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:24,352
I don't have all the materials
with their generic material.

822
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:25,562
Don't get carried away.

823
00:59:26,381 --> 00:59:27,673
Well, no matter.

824
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:30,400
We have more than enough pawns.

825
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:35,196
A jutsu this ideal has to have risks.

826
00:59:37,237 --> 00:59:39,531
The most amazing thing
about this jutsu is that...

827
00:59:39,913 --> 00:59:42,453
there is no risk for the jutsu user.

828
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:43,322
What?

829
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:45,496
It's true.

830
00:59:46,013 --> 00:59:50,601
The Reanimation Jutsu has no risk.
Well, it does have one.

831
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:55,550
Because it is such
an amazing, powerful jutsu,

832
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:58,814
the name of its wielder will spread
to every corner of the world.

833
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:03,224
In name, I will be more famous
than Madara Uchiha.

834
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:07,270
But an academic like me
has no desire for fame.

835
01:00:07,452 --> 01:00:08,703
I'll just become a target.

836
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:11,399
Don't get ahead of yourself!

837
01:00:11,815 --> 01:00:14,235
There is a reaction to every action.

838
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:16,279
Stay focused.

839
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,948
I appreciate your advice.

840
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,159
If this jutsu has a risk,

841
01:00:21,363 --> 01:00:24,533
it's that I've given you information
about it.

842
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:33,546
Well, I must be going.

843
01:00:33,813 --> 01:00:36,899
Academics are better suited
to be in gloomy places.

844
01:00:37,292 --> 01:00:38,084
Hold it!

845
01:00:38,173 --> 01:00:41,426
You didn't tell me how to stop
the Reanimation Jutsu yet.

846
01:00:42,141 --> 01:00:43,851
Oh! That's right.

847
01:00:44,179 --> 01:00:45,680
I almost forgot.

848
01:00:46,246 --> 01:00:49,249
Killing the jutsu user
won't stop this jutsu.

849
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,105
So what do you do?

850
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:54,400
It's quite easy really.

851
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:57,945
You manipulate me, the one
who controls the Reanimation Jutsu...

852
01:00:57,987 --> 01:01:01,449
into breaking the jutsu by weaving
the signs... dog, horse and tiger.

853
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:04,285
With your Sharingan, for instance.

854
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:08,956
Otherwise, you can seal away the souls
of those under the Reanimation Jutsu.

855
01:01:09,061 --> 01:01:11,021
That's fine and good, if it's true.

856
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:13,509
I'm not brave enough to lie to you.

857
01:01:17,291 --> 01:01:19,167
Anyway, this conversation is over.

858
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:21,386
I've told you how to stop it.

859
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:22,595
I'm going.

860
01:01:24,812 --> 01:01:28,101
<i>As long as I have that other jutsu
along with the Reanimation Jutsu,</i>

861
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:29,686
<i>I am invincible.</i>

862
01:01:30,125 --> 01:01:34,004
<i>In time, I will unravel the truth
of the Sage of Six Paths.</i>

863
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:40,405
Is White Zetsu's spore tailing him?

864
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,448
Of course.

865
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:46,828
Then Black Zetsu, you can start
preparations for that other thing.

866
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:48,913
Understood.

867
01:01:52,455 --> 01:01:55,792
I would have missed this
without Muta Aburame's intel.

868
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:58,005
A large army is
approaching underground!

869
01:01:58,201 --> 01:02:00,328
We're going to widen our scope!

870
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:04,178
They're going to try to pass
right under us!

871
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:06,848
Are they planning to take
the rear of the Allied Force?

872
01:02:07,277 --> 01:02:08,987
Use Earth Style and dig them up!

873
01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:11,784
Notify Kitsuchi immediately.

874
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:13,479
Intel Unit!

875
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:16,065
Get word about it to
Kitsuchi immediately!

876
01:02:16,922 --> 01:02:17,723
It's coming!

877
01:02:18,675 --> 01:02:19,676
All right!

878
01:02:22,196 --> 01:02:23,448
New intel.

879
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:24,574
Finally.

880
01:02:25,150 --> 01:02:29,119
Enemy, roughly 20,000.
Coordinates: 25 by 30, underground!

881
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:30,580
So that's how they're coming.

882
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:39,505
Reinforcements...

883
01:02:40,242 --> 01:02:41,577
The Reanimation Jutsu...

884
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:45,428
It's more refined than the one
the Second Hokage Tobirama used.

885
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:51,225
To control this many souls
at one time...

886
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:52,543
It's quite a feat.

887
01:03:01,327 --> 01:03:02,831
Kiba! Shino!

888
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:05,105
That was fast, Kiba.

889
01:03:05,432 --> 01:03:07,434
I was told to join you here!

890
01:03:07,689 --> 01:03:09,608
Is the enemy near?

891
01:03:15,258 --> 01:03:18,178
– <i>Earth Style: Erupt!</i>
– <i>Earth Style: Erupt!</i>

892
01:03:34,268 --> 01:03:35,353
Captain Mifune!

893
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:37,396
We received a message
from Headquarters!

894
01:03:37,523 --> 01:03:41,027
The enemy force is passing through
directly under us, deep underground!

895
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:44,320
Our shinobi in the Sensory Unit
couldn't detect them?

896
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:46,823
They must not be human.

897
01:03:47,738 --> 01:03:48,574
All right!

898
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:51,882
Considering our Fifth Company's
elongated deployment,

899
01:03:51,907 --> 01:03:53,408
I'll send in several squads

900
01:03:53,746 --> 01:03:59,210
closest in proximity to Kitsuchi and
his Second Company as reinforcements!

901
01:04:00,716 --> 01:04:01,447
Make haste!

902
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:41,043
It seems like there are
a lot fewer guards around.

903
01:04:42,989 --> 01:04:44,240
We could make a run for it now.

904
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:47,800
Let's look for Sasuke.

905
01:04:48,406 --> 01:04:52,035
You go on ahead.
I'm going to look for my blade.

906
01:04:52,606 --> 01:04:53,857
I found the key right away,

907
01:04:54,146 --> 01:04:56,232
but my blade is
nowhere to be found.

908
01:04:56,776 --> 01:05:01,948
They confiscated it, right?
Then look in the armory.

909
01:05:02,470 --> 01:05:03,210
Let's go.

910
01:05:03,774 --> 01:05:05,568
What? You're going to help me?

911
01:05:06,164 --> 01:05:09,709
You're all right, Jugo.
Unlike that Karin.

912
01:05:10,213 --> 01:05:11,923
Speaking of which,
where'd she go?

913
01:05:12,781 --> 01:05:13,782
Want to look for her?

914
01:05:15,657 --> 01:05:18,494
Without her around,
it's a little too quiet...

915
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:20,124
What should we do?

916
01:05:32,239 --> 01:05:33,532
I'm going to keep releasing them!

917
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:35,306
Zaji, take care of the signal fire!

918
01:05:35,523 --> 01:05:36,167
Right!

919
01:05:40,831 --> 01:05:42,916
Red smoke,
that's the Commando Unit.

920
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:43,981
Hurry!

921
01:05:43,981 --> 01:05:44,590
Right.

922
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:48,314
Are you all right,
Master Zabuza?

923
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:51,739
Looks like we wasted a jutsu, Haku.

924
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:56,827
This Reanimation Jutsu revives the dead,
but they can't be killed.

925
01:05:57,703 --> 01:05:59,705
I don't like this jutsu...

926
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:05,419
You did well to detect them, Haku.

927
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:10,216
That species of giant bird
generally fly in pairs.

928
01:06:11,008 --> 01:06:13,135
They work together to
catch their prey.

929
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:15,346
However, that's only
during the winter

930
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:17,223
when they are raising their young...

931
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:19,684
And that looks like a beacon
made to look like a cloud.

932
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:23,771
No doubt, the enemy
that attacked is over there.

933
01:06:27,409 --> 01:06:28,410
Snow?

934
01:06:29,082 --> 01:06:30,083
A cold air?

935
01:06:35,530 --> 01:06:37,365
<i>Secret Jutsu: Crystal Ice Mirrors!</i>

936
01:06:54,218 --> 01:06:55,803
Owww...

937
01:06:58,139 --> 01:07:00,474
H-Hey... That thing...

938
01:07:01,203 --> 01:07:03,831
What? They're just kids.

939
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:07,815
We can't die. So we can just strike.

940
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:11,569
They are Kekkei Genkai shinobi!

941
01:07:12,486 --> 01:07:14,321
I'm different.

942
01:07:14,873 --> 01:07:17,125
We bear no grudge against you.

943
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:20,119
We're just not in control
of our actions.

944
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:23,210
They're coming!

945
01:07:35,285 --> 01:07:36,286
Kakashi?

946
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:38,596
Kakashi!
You're a lifesaver!

947
01:07:39,031 --> 01:07:41,159
Don't start celebrating yet.

948
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:44,018
These guys are all pesky shinobi.

949
01:07:44,642 --> 01:07:47,103
I knew we would have to fight,

950
01:07:47,249 --> 01:07:49,835
but I never imaged it would
be against you, Kakashi.

951
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:53,444
That day on the bridge,

952
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:56,906
you were supposed to finish me off
and send me to hell.

953
01:07:57,114 --> 01:07:59,909
When I came to,
I was in the same place as Haku.

954
01:08:00,541 --> 01:08:03,878
It seems this is neither heaven nor hell.

955
01:08:05,372 --> 01:08:07,208
This is the world of the living.

956
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:10,252
You are under the Reanimation Jutsu.

957
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,880
What? He knows them?

958
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:14,632
Wait for Captain Kakashi's signal.

959
01:08:15,716 --> 01:08:17,510
Zabuza... Haku...

960
01:08:19,073 --> 01:08:23,869
Oh... You've matured, Kakashi's kunoichi.

961
01:08:24,101 --> 01:08:26,229
How is that kid?

962
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:27,895
Huh?

963
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:29,897
Uh-huh...

964
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:35,694
<i>When a person has something precious
they want to protect...</i>

965
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:38,447
<i>that's when they can
truly become strong.</i>

966
01:08:43,109 --> 01:08:45,612
<i>I know that well enough too!</i>

967
01:08:48,346 --> 01:08:49,847
<i>You'll get strong.</i>

968
01:08:50,646 --> 01:08:52,439
<i>I hope we meet again somewhere.</i>

969
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:53,855
<i>Yeah!</i>

970
01:08:57,758 --> 01:08:59,718
We lost because of him...

971
01:09:00,686 --> 01:09:02,768
He must be all grown up.

972
01:09:03,271 --> 01:09:04,481
He's probably famous too.

973
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:08,534
Yeah, that bridge is now called
the Great Naruto Bridge.

974
01:09:09,338 --> 01:09:13,925
Everyone in the village calls him
the miraculous hero now.

975
01:09:16,376 --> 01:09:20,589
Thanks to you both, Naruto was
able to find his Ninja Way.

976
01:09:21,373 --> 01:09:24,250
And he made a pledge at your graves,

977
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:28,455
and he's grown into
a fine shinobi since then.

978
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:32,168
Then he will become even stronger.

979
01:09:33,967 --> 01:09:36,379
Were you able to reminisce a little?

980
01:09:37,128 --> 01:09:38,921
Because it's time to get serious.

981
01:09:39,768 --> 01:09:41,244
Power is welling up!

982
01:09:42,021 --> 01:09:43,648
The main act starts now!

983
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:49,643
Kakashi... Stop us...

984
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:54,777
Retreat!

985
01:09:57,266 --> 01:09:59,061
Kakashi, these people...

986
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:01,197
I know! There's no doubt!

987
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:03,532
The Demon Zabuza Momochi!

988
01:10:03,574 --> 01:10:05,201
And Haku of the Ice Style!

989
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:12,613
I'm losing... consciousness...

990
01:10:13,349 --> 01:10:15,127
Damn...

991
01:10:15,954 --> 01:10:19,082
The inside of my head...
feels so hot...

992
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:22,650
That demonic aura...

993
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:24,970
So this is the Demon Zabuza!

994
01:10:25,146 --> 01:10:26,689
On top of that, the Ice Style child!

995
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:29,433
On guard! Stay alert, Guy!

996
01:10:30,351 --> 01:10:33,187
No one comes close to him
in Silent Killing!

997
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:36,941
Kakashi... Please...

998
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:41,153
Stop us once again...

999
01:10:42,631 --> 01:10:46,007
My dream was always to
be Master Zabuza's tool

1000
01:10:46,413 --> 01:10:50,167
and die protecting him...

1001
01:10:51,163 --> 01:10:56,043
The fact that Master Zabuza is under
the power of this jutsu means...

1002
01:10:57,463 --> 01:11:02,209
that I was not able to protect him
from you back then.

1003
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:07,263
Furthermore, not only am I incapable
of protecting Master Zabuza,

1004
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:11,141
I can't even serve as his tool now.

1005
01:11:11,892 --> 01:11:14,812
No, you protected Zabuza.

1006
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:17,356
He died for a different reason.

1007
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:22,653
And... Zabuza never thought
of you as a tool.

1008
01:11:25,306 --> 01:11:29,451
K-Kakashi, quit babbling nonsense.

1009
01:11:30,522 --> 01:11:32,169
Zabuza and Haku, huh.

1010
01:11:32,781 --> 01:11:34,373
They're quite tenacious.

1011
01:11:35,088 --> 01:11:37,001
I still haven't been able
to bind them completely

1012
01:11:38,928 --> 01:11:41,805
I'll soon turn you into
mere killing puppets!

1013
01:11:42,679 --> 01:11:44,431
You are my tools!

1014
01:11:46,594 --> 01:11:49,722
K-Kakashi, don't hesitate.

1015
01:11:50,517 --> 01:11:54,646
Use whatever means it takes...
to stop me.

1016
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:57,396
I died already.

1017
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:02,359
I died human...

1018
01:12:04,862 --> 01:12:07,156
Yes, I know.

1019
01:12:12,794 --> 01:12:14,371
Master Zabuza...

1020
01:12:14,946 --> 01:12:16,002
Thank you.

1021
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:23,422
Here they come!

1022
01:12:23,693 --> 01:12:26,442
Captain Kakashi!
That Hidden Rock shinobi...

1023
01:12:26,766 --> 01:12:29,261
A user of the Explosion Style
Kekkei Genkai.

1024
01:12:29,528 --> 01:12:32,358
He's a former Explosion Corps captain
like Deidara... That's Gari!

1025
01:12:32,861 --> 01:12:34,158
And that woman is...

1026
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:36,560
the Scorch Style Kekkei Genkai user
from the Hidden Sand...

1027
01:12:36,643 --> 01:12:37,686
Pakura!

1028
01:12:37,843 --> 01:12:39,163
Please be careful!

1029
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:41,265
Kekkei Genkai shinobi... all of them.

1030
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:44,443
<i>Ninja Art: Hidden Mist Jutsu.</i>

1031
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:48,364
The fighting unit will comprise mainly
of sensory-type shinobi!

1032
01:12:48,644 --> 01:12:50,799
The rest will take a Manji Formation

1033
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:54,078
at 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock
and provide cover!

1034
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:58,167
We will pinpoint Zabuza
using only sound!

1035
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:00,292
The mist is becoming thicker.

1036
01:13:01,075 --> 01:13:02,785
Our field of vision isn't good enough.

1037
01:13:02,986 --> 01:13:05,780
Sakura, you don't need to be afraid!

1038
01:13:06,110 --> 01:13:08,487
I will guard you with my life!

1039
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:12,431
The last time, they attacked the dead spot
in this formation, the center.

1040
01:13:12,679 --> 01:13:13,931
Watch your backs!

1041
01:13:14,399 --> 01:13:16,377
After the mist... cold air.

1042
01:13:19,269 --> 01:13:20,270
It's begun!

1043
01:13:21,329 --> 01:13:23,822
It's different from the last time,
after all.

1044
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:26,819
To be able to bind so strongly...

1045
01:13:27,347 --> 01:13:29,641
As one would expect from
Lord Orochimaru's chakra.

1046
01:13:30,974 --> 01:13:34,435
To be able to overwrite
my own control tags...

1047
01:13:35,702 --> 01:13:39,440
However, I purposely kept
their emotions intact

1048
01:13:39,465 --> 01:13:41,330
to psychologically torment the enemy.

1049
01:13:42,435 --> 01:13:44,854
That results in a weaker binding

1050
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:48,082
and the soul dies when the heart
undergoes a change.

1051
01:13:48,781 --> 01:13:51,284
This time, I will kill all feeling.

1052
01:13:51,910 --> 01:13:55,079
Right now, I don't know who among
the enemy pawns I can do this to.

1053
01:13:55,469 --> 01:13:58,510
I'll just gather data from this war.

1054
01:14:00,118 --> 01:14:01,495
As for the rest of the pawns,

1055
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,064
I'll bind them to the point of
obeying my orders,

1056
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:06,108
and leave them to their own accord.

1057
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:10,946
Some will probably be more beneficial
with their emotions left intact.

1058
01:14:16,571 --> 01:14:17,780
He was mummified.

1059
01:14:18,994 --> 01:14:20,120
This jutsu...

1060
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:22,124
Here they come!

1061
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:28,297
<i>Scorch Style: Super Steam Kill!</i>

1062
01:14:29,571 --> 01:14:31,308
My insides...!

1063
01:14:34,428 --> 01:14:36,180
<i>Explosion Style: Land Mine Fist!</i>

1064
01:14:39,056 --> 01:14:41,850
No way... Tajiki blew up!

1065
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:45,900
You bastard!

1066
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:53,113
– <i>Leaf Hurricane!</i>
– <i>Leaf Hurricane!</i>

1067
01:14:53,511 --> 01:14:54,265
Guy!

1068
01:14:58,076 --> 01:14:59,828
Comrades die on the battlefield!

1069
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:02,206
That is one thing
you must learn to accept!

1070
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:05,209
Losing your cool can cause
even more comrades to die!

1071
01:15:05,911 --> 01:15:07,603
Place your comrade's death
into the recesses of your mind!

1072
01:15:07,628 --> 01:15:09,129
Understand, newbie?

1073
01:15:09,419 --> 01:15:10,514
Y-Yes!

1074
01:15:13,565 --> 01:15:15,357
Hang in there.
You're going to be all right.

1075
01:15:16,533 --> 01:15:18,994
I'm beginning to understand how
the enemy is coordinating this.

1076
01:15:19,139 --> 01:15:20,265
Now it's my turn!

1077
01:15:23,548 --> 01:15:26,634
I'm not so naïve as to allow
the enemy time to act.

1078
01:15:28,633 --> 01:15:30,134
– <i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>
– <i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

1079
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:50,796
No way. Don't tell me...

1080
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:53,173
That's...

1081
01:16:01,322 --> 01:16:05,076
The past members of the Seven
Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist!

1082
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:11,942
Among the legendary
Seven Ninja Swordsmen...

1083
01:16:12,286 --> 01:16:15,915
they've chosen the strongest ones!

1084
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:20,033
The Seven Ninja Swordsmen...

1085
01:16:21,325 --> 01:16:22,868
Nothing from the Ensui Platoon?

1086
01:16:23,362 --> 01:16:24,363
They'll be here shortly.

1087
01:16:25,509 --> 01:16:27,928
Maki of the Hidden Sand,
what about you?

1088
01:16:28,333 --> 01:16:30,002
We're ready to roll!

1089
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:33,463
All right, buy some time
for Ensui's squad.

1090
01:16:34,214 --> 01:16:35,841
Everyone, attack together!

1091
01:16:43,181 --> 01:16:45,309
It's not here either.

1092
01:16:46,194 --> 01:16:49,614
You said you're gathering all
the lost Hidden Mist Blades.

1093
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:52,316
Why are you so obsessed?

1094
01:16:52,647 --> 01:16:53,940
What?

1095
01:16:53,984 --> 01:16:57,070
You said you'd help me.
Don't tell me you're giving up?

1096
01:16:57,487 --> 01:17:00,240
You're the one who gives up.

1097
01:17:00,882 --> 01:17:03,802
Except when it comes
to the ninja blades.

1098
01:17:06,047 --> 01:17:08,758
I need one thing to keep me going.

1099
01:17:09,133 --> 01:17:11,343
Resurrecting
the Seven Ninja Swordsmen

1100
01:17:11,543 --> 01:17:14,421
and becoming their leader
is my dream.

1101
01:17:15,048 --> 01:17:15,865
Resurrect?

1102
01:17:16,511 --> 01:17:17,424
Yeah.

1103
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:20,510
Right now, the Seven Ninja
Swordsmen consists

1104
01:17:20,552 --> 01:17:22,429
of a single brat named Chojuro.

1105
01:17:23,199 --> 01:17:26,183
Traditionally, the ninja blade is passed
down from generation to generation.

1106
01:17:26,224 --> 01:17:29,061
Right now, there is only one blade,
known as the Hiramekarei.

1107
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:30,520
Nothing else.

1108
01:17:31,589 --> 01:17:35,150
The great blade, Samehada, is in Kisame's
possession, but he's a rogue ninja.

1109
01:17:35,532 --> 01:17:38,602
I finally got a hold of the
Executioner's Blade, only to lose it.

1110
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:45,160
So officially,
that unit doesn't exist today.

1111
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:48,534
For now, anyway...

1112
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:52,042
What do we do against
guys like that?

1113
01:17:52,427 --> 01:17:54,913
They're the Seven Ninja Swordsmen!

1114
01:17:55,379 --> 01:17:57,714
The longer we keep this up,
the greater our disadvantage.

1115
01:17:58,481 --> 01:17:59,949
Don't worry so much!

1116
01:18:00,467 --> 01:18:02,594
The Reanimation Jutsu
can be stopped

1117
01:18:02,594 --> 01:18:05,389
by sealing away the soul
or immobilizing their body.

1118
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:08,517
And other than Zabuza,
no one is wielding a sword.

1119
01:18:08,995 --> 01:18:11,392
That cuts their strength in half.

1120
01:18:12,922 --> 01:18:13,767
No.

1121
01:18:16,442 --> 01:18:18,736
It seems they brought their swords.

1122
01:18:27,911 --> 01:18:29,287
Not all of them have one.

1123
01:18:30,622 --> 01:18:32,582
The mist is getting even thicker...

1124
01:18:32,999 --> 01:18:34,668
We can't see through this.

1125
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:37,421
And there's no sound
with Silent Killing.

1126
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:39,172
We can't even hear them.

1127
01:18:39,464 --> 01:18:41,383
We must do something
about this mist,

1128
01:18:41,425 --> 01:18:43,093
or the Allied Forces are
at a disadvantage.

1129
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:45,095
You have a plan?

1130
01:18:45,512 --> 01:18:46,972
I'm preparing it now.

1131
01:18:47,514 --> 01:18:49,516
Then I'll leave you to handle it!

1132
01:18:58,775 --> 01:19:01,945
Lee! Go after the Scorch Style!
I'll take the Explosion Style!

1133
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,321
Understood!

1134
01:19:04,707 --> 01:19:05,708
Captain Kakashi!

1135
01:19:06,116 --> 01:19:08,368
I'm ready with my Shadow Possession
and Shadow Paralysis!

1136
01:19:08,827 --> 01:19:10,328
All right, fasten it to me.

1137
01:19:10,917 --> 01:19:13,252
Ensui, reduce the strength
of the Shadow Possession,

1138
01:19:13,373 --> 01:19:15,417
and stay focused on my movements.

1139
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:16,887
Right!

1140
01:19:18,329 --> 01:19:21,631
Santa Yamanaka, use the Mind
Transfer Jutsu to enter my body.

1141
01:19:22,215 --> 01:19:26,511
With your sensory skills, you will be
able to track and find Zabuza in this mist!

1142
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:27,626
Right!

1143
01:19:29,055 --> 01:19:32,267
Once you perceive Zabuza,
since I'll be under Shadow Possession,

1144
01:19:32,309 --> 01:19:35,061
guide me to a location
where I can see him.

1145
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:37,565
Get me behind him
as close as you can.

1146
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:39,916
When I have
a clear sight of him,

1147
01:19:39,941 --> 01:19:42,235
immediately release
the Mind Transfer Jutsu

1148
01:19:42,260 --> 01:19:43,428
and return me to my body.

1149
01:19:44,988 --> 01:19:48,116
I will grapple with Zabuza
and step on his shadow

1150
01:19:48,158 --> 01:19:49,201
and get him into position.

1151
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:52,579
At that point, Ensui,
immediately increase the power

1152
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:54,915
of your Shadow Possession
and Shadow Stitching Jutsu

1153
01:19:54,956 --> 01:19:56,374
and bind him!

1154
01:19:56,958 --> 01:20:02,214
Then Maki, completely immobilize Zabuza
with your Cloth Paralysis Jutsu!

1155
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:03,381
Yes!

1156
01:20:04,090 --> 01:20:04,683
Let's do this!

1157
01:20:04,856 --> 01:20:05,434
Right!

1158
01:20:05,926 --> 01:20:07,219
<i>Mind Transfer Jutsu!</i>

1159
01:20:08,554 --> 01:20:11,139
Anyway, there are lots
of other blades.

1160
01:20:12,229 --> 01:20:14,563
Among the Ninja Swordsmen
throughout history,

1161
01:20:14,588 --> 01:20:18,467
there were super masters besides
Kisame, Zabuza and Chojuro.

1162
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:20,177
First...

1163
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:24,152
Imbued with lightning,
the sharpest blades of all...

1164
01:20:25,245 --> 01:20:27,714
The wielder of the Lightning Blades, Kiba...

1165
01:20:27,739 --> 01:20:28,949
Ameyuri Ringo.

1166
01:20:31,868 --> 01:20:34,055
Crushing through any defense...

1167
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:38,375
The wielder of the Blunt Blade, Kabutowari...

1168
01:20:38,628 --> 01:20:40,130
Jinin Akebino.

1169
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:46,341
The blade that pierces through everything...

1170
01:20:46,546 --> 01:20:47,611
and stitches it together...

1171
01:20:49,894 --> 01:20:51,980
the Long Blade, Nuibari.

1172
01:20:52,806 --> 01:20:54,266
Its wielder is Kushimaru Kuriarare.

1173
01:20:57,242 --> 01:20:59,612
The blade that adds explosive power
to every swing...

1174
01:21:01,648 --> 01:21:03,692
The Blast Blade, Shibuki.

1175
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:06,069
And its wielder, Jinpachi Munashi.

1176
01:21:10,615 --> 01:21:13,034
The one who, just like Kisame Hoshigaki,

1177
01:21:13,076 --> 01:21:17,581
wielded the Great Blade, Samehada...
Fuguki Suikazan.

1178
01:21:18,957 --> 01:21:22,502
And the one who mastered
all seven swords.

1179
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:25,463
Known as the second Coming
of the Demon, my older brother...

1180
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:28,049
Mangetsu Hozuki.

1181
01:21:29,634 --> 01:21:33,513
And I am going to be the captain
of the new generation

1182
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:36,766
of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen, and...

1183
01:21:36,902 --> 01:21:39,488
Enough. You're talking too loud.

1184
01:21:39,769 --> 01:21:42,564
Hey, I was coming to the climax.

1185
01:21:43,648 --> 01:21:46,359
The sword you broke
in two, right?

1186
01:21:47,152 --> 01:21:49,988
Shouldn't you just make
a new sword?

1187
01:21:51,005 --> 01:21:52,382
You don't know a thing.

1188
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:55,660
That blade has a certain power.

1189
01:21:57,662 --> 01:21:59,664
The Severing Sword,
the Executioner's Blade,

1190
01:21:59,706 --> 01:22:01,166
cannot be chipped or nicked.

1191
01:22:01,819 --> 01:22:04,530
No, a better way to put it is,
the blade repairs itself.

1192
01:22:05,243 --> 01:22:08,496
It cuts into humans,
then absorbs their blood.

1193
01:22:09,299 --> 01:22:12,010
It regenerates itself with
the iron present in blood.

1194
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:14,763
<i>All right! Found him!</i>

1195
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:16,514
<i>Mind Transfer Jutsu, release!</i>

1196
01:22:17,583 --> 01:22:19,334
<i>Good luck, Captain Kakashi!</i>

1197
01:22:20,226 --> 01:22:21,227
<i>All right!</i>

1198
01:22:21,252 --> 01:22:22,253
<i>He hasn't noticed me.</i>

1199
01:22:22,687 --> 01:22:23,688
<i>I can do this!</i>

1200
01:22:32,113 --> 01:22:34,407
<i>He intends to slash me along
with the boy?!</i>

1201
01:23:13,279 --> 01:23:16,157
I'm glad you were
Naruto's first opponents.

1202
01:23:26,449 --> 01:23:28,253
Maki, stay behind me and

1203
01:23:28,416 --> 01:23:31,544
stand by with
your Cloth Paralysis Jutsu!

1204
01:23:31,756 --> 01:23:32,378
Right!

1205
01:23:41,266 --> 01:23:42,308
<i>Why?</i>

1206
01:23:42,892 --> 01:23:44,561
<i>Why can't I keep up?</i>

1207
01:23:45,061 --> 01:23:46,229
<i>Damn it!</i>

1208
01:23:56,781 --> 01:23:59,534
<i>You can't possibly defeat me
the way you are now.</i>

1209
01:24:00,076 --> 01:24:01,327
<i>What was that?!</i>

1210
01:24:01,995 --> 01:24:03,288
<i>You still don't realize...</i>

1211
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:10,879
Zabuza...

1212
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:15,383
That time,
you hesitated to kill Haku

1213
01:24:15,546 --> 01:24:20,342
and you couldn't hide the turmoil
in your heart over Haku's death.

1214
01:24:24,434 --> 01:24:25,602
But it's different this time.

1215
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:28,104
You're just a tool
with no feelings.

1216
01:24:29,355 --> 01:24:31,483
Let's put an end
to a fight like this!

1217
01:24:33,818 --> 01:24:37,322
<i>Hey, hey... Kakashi-sensei.</i>

1218
01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:39,240
<i>What do you think about this?</i>

1219
01:24:39,824 --> 01:24:40,825
About what?

1220
01:24:43,203 --> 01:24:45,330
Well, those two were enemies...

1221
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:52,879
I... liked those guys.

1222
01:24:56,758 --> 01:24:58,635
Is that weird?

1223
01:25:04,432 --> 01:25:05,305
<i>No.</i>

1224
01:25:07,477 --> 01:25:08,478
<i>I feel the same way.</i>

1225
01:25:19,492 --> 01:25:20,710
Ensui! Bind him!

1226
01:25:21,407 --> 01:25:22,700
<i>That's my signal! Okay!</i>

1227
01:25:23,261 --> 01:25:24,387
<i>Shadow Paralysis Jutsu!</i>

1228
01:25:34,838 --> 01:25:37,173
<i>The way you died and your tears...</i>

1229
01:25:46,558 --> 01:25:49,102
<i>demonstrated your bond
to each other.</i>

1230
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:55,191
<i>I have many things I want
to protect as a shinobi.</i>

1231
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:57,068
<i>Zabuza and Haku...</i>

1232
01:25:58,359 --> 01:26:00,695
<i>Protecting the dignity of their deaths
is one of those things.</i>

1233
01:26:02,178 --> 01:26:05,222
<i>Especially since I am
their final enemy.</i>

1234
01:26:19,048 --> 01:26:22,343
<i>Naruto... What do you think?</i>

1235
01:26:27,593 --> 01:26:28,636
Now, Maki!

1236
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:29,878
Right!

1237
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,441
Damn it!

1238
01:26:38,234 --> 01:26:39,235
This is...

1239
01:26:39,903 --> 01:26:41,446
The mist is clearing...

1240
01:26:42,655 --> 01:26:44,824
All right!
Now we can see the enemy!

1241
01:26:48,536 --> 01:26:50,955
As long as these tags remain,
they cannot be recalled.

1242
01:26:51,897 --> 01:26:53,774
I will keep an eye on
these two bodies.

1243
01:26:54,541 --> 01:26:55,542
All right...

1244
01:26:56,169 --> 01:26:58,963
The Reanimation Jutsu...
This is an unforgivable jutsu!

1245
01:26:59,672 --> 01:27:02,884
Sai, next we'll use your
Foundation Sealing Jutsu!

1246
01:27:03,595 --> 01:27:04,596
You're up!

1247
01:27:04,928 --> 01:27:07,138
But... But I still haven't mastered
that jutsu...

1248
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:10,469
Isn't it a fact that you were
highly regarded by Danzo?

1249
01:27:11,559 --> 01:27:13,519
There's no need to suppress
your emotions anymore!

1250
01:27:15,855 --> 01:27:19,359
Well... It takes me a while
to get upset too...

1251
01:27:20,677 --> 01:27:23,263
But this time,
my boiling point was low.

1252
01:27:24,356 --> 01:27:27,150
Copy ninja Kakashi has copied
a thousand jutsu...

1253
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:31,579
And I'm going to use them
to their fullest extent!

1254
01:27:32,378 --> 01:27:33,591
Attack!

1255
01:27:35,972 --> 01:27:37,182
<i>Fang Over Fang!</i>

1256
01:27:39,545 --> 01:27:41,339
<i>Secret Jutsu: Insect Sphere!</i>

1257
01:27:45,301 --> 01:27:46,970
<i>Eight Trigrams Air Palm!</i>

1258
01:27:54,394 --> 01:27:55,979
<i>Eight Trigrams Palm Rotation!</i>

1259
01:28:07,448 --> 01:28:08,449
Neji!

1260
01:28:10,420 --> 01:28:11,838
There are too many of them...

1261
01:28:12,912 --> 01:28:15,373
So they absorb chakra...

1262
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:21,963
<i>Gentle Fist Art: Body Blow!</i>

1263
01:28:33,391 --> 01:28:35,685
One after another...
There's no end to them!

1264
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:37,687
Stop whining and move!

1265
01:28:38,396 --> 01:28:40,606
Each one is strong and persistent!

1266
01:28:41,816 --> 01:28:43,568
This is attrition warfare.

1267
01:28:46,738 --> 01:28:47,739
Captain Kitsuchi!

1268
01:28:47,780 --> 01:28:49,032
We have word from Headquarters!

1269
01:28:49,657 --> 01:28:52,535
Several thousand have
gotten past us!

1270
01:28:52,965 --> 01:28:53,799
Dad!

1271
01:28:53,824 --> 01:28:55,576
Quiet! I know!

1272
01:29:26,207 --> 01:29:27,416
Here they come.

1273
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:37,538
Mu is not moving.

1274
01:29:39,082 --> 01:29:40,625
There's no sign of him
or his chakra.

1275
01:29:40,833 --> 01:29:42,543
Seems the Second Tsuchikage
has been detected.

1276
01:29:42,543 --> 01:29:44,629
Even though he was known
as the "Null Man."

1277
01:29:46,464 --> 01:29:48,508
It will soon be ripe for war.

1278
01:29:49,385 --> 01:29:50,882
The real fight is just beginning.

1279
01:29:52,762 --> 01:29:56,182
With that class of shinobi,
I anticipate bigger results

1280
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:59,352
by not killing off their
thoughts and emotions.

1281
01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:07,235
I'll let him do as he pleases
after the Summoning Jutsu.

1282
01:30:25,253 --> 01:30:26,796
The Second Tsuchikage...

1283
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:29,298
The Third Raikage...

1284
01:30:29,924 --> 01:30:31,551
The Second Mizukage...

1285
01:30:32,093 --> 01:30:33,803
The Fourth Kazekage...

1286
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:37,682
Too bad we don't have a Hokage.

1287
01:30:38,266 --> 01:30:40,852
Still, four Kage from history
are here.

1288
01:30:43,304 --> 01:30:46,474
I'll just let the Kage and
their progeny kill each other off.

1289
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:52,572
Where am I?

1290
01:30:55,658 --> 01:30:59,829
My, my... What a gathering
of former enemies!

1291
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:03,875
Well, well. I don't know this guy.

1292
01:31:05,835 --> 01:31:08,504
This is a foul jutsu of
the Second Hokage.

1293
01:31:08,921 --> 01:31:11,007
The dead are summoned back from
the afterlife and then bound.

1294
01:31:11,048 --> 01:31:14,719
You were summoned here by force.

1295
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:17,555
The dead?! What do you mean?

1296
01:31:18,097 --> 01:31:19,098
Have you forgotten?

1297
01:31:19,484 --> 01:31:21,027
I killed you myself.

1298
01:31:21,767 --> 01:31:25,480
You died ages ago,
Second Mizukage.

1299
01:31:26,981 --> 01:31:30,693
Oh... back then... Hey wait!

1300
01:31:31,110 --> 01:31:36,491
You also died that day!
In fact, I killed you.

1301
01:31:36,782 --> 01:31:37,825
Was that so?

1302
01:31:38,534 --> 01:31:39,702
Well, no matter.

1303
01:31:40,369 --> 01:31:43,039
Let me continue...
Where was I?

1304
01:31:43,614 --> 01:31:45,741
Where is the Second Hokage?

1305
01:31:46,417 --> 01:31:48,294
He's the jutsu user who resurrected us?

1306
01:31:49,837 --> 01:31:52,757
I sense someone several kilometers ahead.

1307
01:31:54,675 --> 01:31:57,666
<i>One with the same chakra
as this new face...</i>

1308
01:31:57,691 --> 01:31:59,443
<i>along with a huge army.</i>

1309
01:32:00,625 --> 01:32:02,126
No doubt you are...

1310
01:32:02,892 --> 01:32:04,936
I am the Fourth Kazekage.

1311
01:32:05,728 --> 01:32:08,689
My predecessors have told me
about your exploits.

1312
01:32:09,732 --> 01:32:12,360
So this means the Sand has continued

1313
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:15,154
through to the Fourth, no,
the Fifth generation.

1314
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:19,742
It feels strange being in the future.

1315
01:32:19,784 --> 01:32:22,119
Listen, this is not the future.

1316
01:32:22,411 --> 01:32:24,413
We are merely relics of the past.

1317
01:32:24,789 --> 01:32:27,833
Listen to me,
or I'll kill you.

1318
01:32:28,042 --> 01:32:32,838
I'm already dead!
Besides, I'm the one who killed you!

1319
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:34,715
Enough of that. You're missing the point.

1320
01:32:34,823 --> 01:32:37,868
I'm talking about the Second Hokage,
who resurrected us...

1321
01:32:40,676 --> 01:32:44,472
The Second Hokage was long dead by my time.

1322
01:32:45,226 --> 01:32:48,896
However, I knew a shinobi capable
of using the Reanimation Jutsu.

1323
01:32:50,383 --> 01:32:51,899
His name is Orochimaru.

1324
01:32:58,172 --> 01:33:00,966
Four... and among them...

1325
01:33:02,785 --> 01:33:04,161
is Father.

1326
01:33:04,870 --> 01:33:07,415
A jutsu that controls
the Second Hokage...

1327
01:33:07,942 --> 01:33:10,778
The user doesn't seem to be
the Second Hokage,

1328
01:33:10,918 --> 01:33:12,837
but this Reanimation Jutsu...

1329
01:33:13,629 --> 01:33:16,257
There are times when your body
won't do what you want it to.

1330
01:33:16,716 --> 01:33:19,218
Movement is restricted.

1331
01:33:19,802 --> 01:33:21,637
Seems that way.

1332
01:33:22,305 --> 01:33:26,225
I thought about killing you
earlier, but my body wouldn't let me.

1333
01:33:27,354 --> 01:33:30,149
I would have enjoyed
battling you all.

1334
01:33:30,930 --> 01:33:32,515
Such a shame, such a shame...

1335
01:33:38,404 --> 01:33:39,822
<i>Gaara, eh...</i>
