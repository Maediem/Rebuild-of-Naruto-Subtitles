1
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,180
All right! We've cornered him!

2
00:00:19,145 --> 00:00:22,440
<i>Just when I thought I regained
consciousness, this happens...</i>

3
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,150
What's that?!

4
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:36,494
<i>You're strong, after all...
Pakura-sensei.</i>

5
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:38,872
Maki...?

6
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:40,874
Let me out!

7
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:44,878
I've had it! I'm completely fed up!

8
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:47,756
I'm going to explode, hmm!

9
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,674
You're okay with that, huh?

10
00:00:50,046 --> 00:00:52,260
We got you sealed
with the Lightning Style,

11
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,179
especially so you can't explode.

12
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:57,891
So shut your trap! You dud!

13
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,853
There are no such things
as duds in art!

14
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,022
Huh?!

15
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,901
No way, an explosion?!

16
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,079
What is it?!

17
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:20,872
What is this?

18
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:23,500
Dan!

19
00:01:24,631 --> 00:01:28,092
Yeah. Looks like someone succeeded.

20
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,304
Naruto, the Jinchuriki are fading away!

21
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,641
Looks like Itachi did it!

22
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,437
<i>Thanks, Itachi!</i>

23
00:01:45,835 --> 00:01:47,837
But this battle ain't going anywhere!

24
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:51,277
No time to waste! Let's go!

25
00:01:58,714 --> 00:02:00,132
Tell Ohnoki...

26
00:02:01,737 --> 00:02:04,281
He must secure the future of
the Allied Shinobi Forces...

27
00:02:04,323 --> 00:02:06,826
Only then can he come
and tell me all about it...

28
00:02:10,795 --> 00:02:12,213
Just what the hell is going on?

29
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:18,888
I get it...

30
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:22,976
The four-eyes has been
taken down... hmm.

31
00:02:26,837 --> 00:02:29,798
It was a dud.
Don't scare us like that.

32
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,571
It wasn't a dud!

33
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,781
Art is...

34
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,658
indestructible!

35
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,125
Scaring us like that...

36
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:50,962
Granny Chiyo!

37
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:04,231
Looks like I'm free
of the cursed spell.

38
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,780
<i>Looks like I can finally die...</i>

39
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,775
Granny Chiyo!

40
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,194
Kankuro...

41
00:03:17,678 --> 00:03:20,931
I entrust you with the techniques
of the Puppet Master.

42
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:25,121
I accept and will take it over...
Granny Chiyo.

43
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,751
No need to play possum anymore!

44
00:03:34,116 --> 00:03:36,160
Choza, forgive me.

45
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:40,261
Those signs are for the Ghost
Transformation Jutsu, aren't they?

46
00:03:40,497 --> 00:03:41,581
I understand.

47
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,891
Please hurry to
Lady Tsunade's side!

48
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:48,895
This jutsu has killed so many shinobi...

49
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:53,191
I couldn't have imagined that
it would come in handy like this!

50
00:03:54,264 --> 00:03:55,348
<i>Ghost Transformation Jutsu!</i>

51
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,280
Just as I thought!

52
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:03,159
Souls ascending after being released
from the Reanimation Jutsu

53
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:06,287
can be manipulated with this jutsu too.

54
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:09,916
But it doesn't seem like
you have much time.

55
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:16,923
Please hurry!

56
00:04:18,232 --> 00:04:19,233
Yeah...

57
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,387
Farewell, Choza!
Thank you for everything!

58
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,519
Amazing...

59
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,896
He flew off like a ghost!

60
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,940
Just what is the Ghost
Transformation Jutsu?

61
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,615
It allows one to become
a living ghost

62
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,253
that can span long distances
to kill a foe...

63
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,239
Originally, that is...

64
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:45,576
<i>Tsunade...</i>

65
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,148
I...

66
00:05:31,338 --> 00:05:34,133
<i>Curse Kabuto, he's failed.</i>

67
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,546
Hey, what are you looking at?!

68
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:42,216
You're fighting me!

69
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,513
As well as the Green Beast!

70
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,892
Looks like the Reanimation
has been released.

71
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,394
And...

72
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,437
what of it?

73
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,984
What is... that light?

74
00:06:03,466 --> 00:06:06,177
The Susano'o is gone and now...

75
00:06:06,228 --> 00:06:09,439
the dust from the Reanimation
is in a fierce whirlwind.

76
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,497
Without a doubt, this means...

77
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:16,125
The Reanimation has been released.

78
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,336
What?!

79
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,255
We haven't located Kabuto yet.

80
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:22,840
It's too soon!

81
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:27,011
Even if Kabuto was found,
to be able to stop this jutsu...?

82
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,585
Who could have done this?

83
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,182
It doesn't matter!

84
00:06:31,411 --> 00:06:34,789
Whoever did it is a hero
who's saved the Shinobi World!

85
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:39,023
The heavens haven't forsaken us yet!

86
00:06:39,415 --> 00:06:43,044
It appears you have able shinobi
on your side too.

87
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,321
It can't be helped...

88
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,156
He was prepared for this?

89
00:06:47,904 --> 00:06:48,905
Not yet!

90
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,796
He's planning a final strike
before he disappears!

91
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:56,457
<i>Fire Style: Dragon Flame Caterwaul!</i>

92
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,709
<i>Water Style:</i>

93
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,086
No... It won't make it in time!

94
00:07:05,201 --> 00:07:06,452
Lady Hokage!

95
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,177
I'm all right!

96
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:13,052
<i>The 100 Healings Jutsu has worn off!</i>

97
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,313
<i>But...</i>

98
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,073
<i>we've won...</i>

99
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:30,658
Damn!

100
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:39,876
What was that?!

101
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,587
I thought she completely
lost consciousness!

102
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,506
<i>It's been a long time... Tsunade.</i>

103
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:47,633
<i>It's me, Dan.</i>

104
00:07:51,769 --> 00:07:53,854
<i>Dan... How are you here?!</i>

105
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,683
<i>The Reanimation has been undone.</i>

106
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,853
<i>And I flew over here with
my Ghost Transformation Jutsu.</i>

107
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,982
<i>But that was a close one!</i>

108
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:04,859
<i>Dan...</i>

109
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,112
<i>You haven't changed at all... Tsunade.</i>

110
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,114
<i>Dan...</i>

111
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,575
<i>I have always honored your...</i>

112
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,786
<i>There's no time to wallow
in sentimentalities.</i>

113
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,872
<i>I have to go.</i>

114
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:19,874
<i>Dan!</i>

115
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,920
<i>I ran from my memories of you
for a long time, after your death.</i>

116
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,421
<i>But I've changed!</i>

117
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,834
<i>And now...</i>

118
00:08:26,859 --> 00:08:29,779
<i>I can finally fulfill the dreams</i>

119
00:08:29,869 --> 00:08:31,620
<i>and goals you left behind!</i>

120
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,347
<i>I've become the Hokage!</i>

121
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,265
<i>But...</i>

122
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,850
<i>Thank you, Tsunade.</i>

123
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:42,897
<i>You are fulfilling my dreams
for me just fine.</i>

124
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:48,110
<i>I really caused you a lot of pain.</i>

125
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:49,946
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

126
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,116
<i>I'll be waiting for you on the other side.</i>

127
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,328
<i>But don't come too quickly, okay?</i>

128
00:08:58,118 --> 00:09:00,287
<i>For you yourself are my dream.</i>

129
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:15,655
<i>I was able to protect you at the end...</i>

130
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:20,351
<i>It appears a little bit of good did come
from being reanimated.</i>

131
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,110
Hokage, are you all right?!

132
00:09:29,874 --> 00:09:31,626
Your vitality has returned.

133
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,698
And you received chakra?

134
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,243
I got to see an old friend
for just a little while...

135
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,246
Well, you'll meet again right away.

136
00:09:41,092 --> 00:09:44,261
What? What's going on anyway?

137
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,253
I thought the Reanimation
was undone!

138
00:09:49,988 --> 00:09:53,992
Reanimation is a jutsu that
summons the dead.

139
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,886
However, there is one risk...

140
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,430
Risk?

141
00:09:58,418 --> 00:10:00,670
As long as one knows the signs,

142
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:08,608
the reanimated dead can break the
Reanimation Contract from their end.

143
00:10:09,445 --> 00:10:11,281
Rescind the contract?!

144
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:14,311
When that happens,

145
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,742
you end up with
the biggest problem of all.

146
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:22,663
An immortal body with infinite chakra...
that can move without control.

147
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:24,749
Impossible!

148
00:10:27,681 --> 00:10:29,602
Tell the jutsu caster...

149
00:10:29,627 --> 00:10:32,713
Never use a Forbidden Jutsu carelessly.

150
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,372
<i>Reanimation, release!</i>

151
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,650
How... How can that be...?

152
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,780
Your trivial jutsu can't hold me.

153
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,869
You should know that
after fighting me, right?

154
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:27,826
Now then...

155
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,957
The Perfect Susano'o...

156
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:33,294
Everyone who sees it dies...
or so they say.

157
00:12:34,446 --> 00:12:38,284
I'm almost embarrassed
to have to do this again.

158
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,342
I already used it once...

159
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:47,284
My interest has waned,
thanks to the interference.

160
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:50,312
Perhaps I ought to go
retrieve Nine-Tails instead.

161
00:12:50,975 --> 00:12:51,976
What?

162
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,612
Lord Tsuchikage!

163
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:02,865
We cannot stop him.

164
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,950
We still have to fight!

165
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:07,119
We must stop him here!

166
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,038
So sad...

167
00:13:11,901 --> 00:13:12,902
<i>Lightning Cable!</i>

168
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,002
Guy!

169
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:15,795
Right!

170
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:18,109
Take this! Little Toe Attack!

171
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,646
Heh! You don't look too happy!

172
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:36,148
What's that supposed to mean?

173
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:41,070
Since you're hiding your face,
I can only guess.

174
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,119
If you feel insulted,
take off that mask

175
00:13:43,144 --> 00:13:45,641
and show us how composed you are!

176
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:46,667
Stupid!

177
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,330
Nice going, Naruto!

178
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,334
I told him not to rile up his opponent.

179
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,798
Well... It seems I have
no choice but to use it.

180
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,508
What is that?!

181
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,428
A giant gourd and a bottle...

182
00:14:07,669 --> 00:14:12,173
Frankly, I wanted to revive this
when the conditions were perfect.

183
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,945
It's only a fragment,
but it's not lacking in power.

184
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,542
It's taking too long.

185
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,003
It's time!

186
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:53,475
The statue's been acting weird
since it swallowed something earlier.

187
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,690
Watch closely and feel it
through your skin...

188
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,862
The return of Ten-Tails!

189
00:15:05,257 --> 00:15:07,927
And the beginning of the end!

190
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:11,827
So that's it!

191
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,289
That statue was
the Ten-Tails' actual body!

192
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,083
Huh?! What's Ten-Tails?!

193
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,419
But what's going on?

194
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:24,465
When he declared war at
the Five Kage Summit...

195
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,468
The purpose of this war
was to collect

196
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:30,554
all nine Tailed Beasts' chakra
in order to revive Ten-Tails.

197
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:34,100
He doesn't possess Eight-Tails
or Nine-Tails yet...

198
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:35,976
Is he bluffing?

199
00:15:37,276 --> 00:15:39,486
<i>It's too risky to get up close.</i>

200
00:15:40,103 --> 00:15:41,062
<i>Oh...</i>

201
00:15:42,461 --> 00:15:46,215
<i>Only a fragment,
but it is not lacking in power.</i>

202
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:52,117
<i>Have we given him one tentacle
arm's worth of chakra?</i>

203
00:15:52,174 --> 00:15:54,468
We're always dropping rhymes

204
00:15:54,493 --> 00:15:55,786
But maybe we messed up big time...

205
00:15:55,936 --> 00:15:56,937
Yay!

206
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:02,878
The chakra from a tentacle
was taken, just a little

207
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,756
I may not look it
I admit I'm flustered a bit

208
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,050
He took the chakra from one
of Eight-Tails' tentacle arms...

209
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:11,345
Does that mean only a portion
of a Tailed Beast is sufficient?

210
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,055
<i>Naruto...</i>

211
00:16:13,566 --> 00:16:15,484
<i>You felt it too, didn't you?</i>

212
00:16:16,106 --> 00:16:20,152
<i>That was my chakra in
that bottle and gourd.</i>

213
00:16:20,293 --> 00:16:21,001
Yup...

214
00:16:26,562 --> 00:16:27,939
<i>Let me take over, Naruto.</i>

215
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,447
<i>I'll explain.</i>

216
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:35,285
<i>About Ten-Tails too.
You listen from in here.</i>

217
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,771
You know about Ten-Tails, Kurama?

218
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:40,515
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

219
00:16:42,909 --> 00:16:44,578
<i>Listen up, everyone!</i>

220
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:45,860
Hmm?

221
00:16:45,885 --> 00:16:46,886
That voice!

222
00:16:47,109 --> 00:16:49,945
Naruto and the Nine-Tails
have switched places!

223
00:16:50,087 --> 00:16:52,422
He'll explain everything to us...

224
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:55,681
Nine-Tails and Naruto
are tight now!

225
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,208
<i>If even just a portion of
the Tailed Beast is sufficient...</i>

226
00:16:59,341 --> 00:17:03,424
<i>Then that statue already has a piece
of Eight-Tails' and my chakra inside it.</i>

227
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:05,691
The Nine-Tails too?!

228
00:17:06,424 --> 00:17:10,795
<i>The bottle and gourd that guy
summoned and fed to the statue just now</i>

229
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,615
<i>were two of Old Man
Six Paths' treasured tools.</i>

230
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,520
<i>They both possess powerful Sealing Jutsu
that can seal away anything and everything.</i>

231
00:17:18,545 --> 00:17:21,665
<i>Once you get put inside either one of
them, you can't get out, no matter what.</i>

232
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,333
<i>So...</i>

233
00:17:24,781 --> 00:17:27,200
<i>Sealed inside the bottle
was a guy named Kinkaku.</i>

234
00:17:27,225 --> 00:17:31,229
<i>And Ginkaku was sealed
inside the gourd.</i>

235
00:17:32,447 --> 00:17:34,741
<i>I suspect they were reanimated
using the Reanimation Jutsu,</i>

236
00:17:34,907 --> 00:17:39,411
<i>used in the war and
then sealed away.</i>

237
00:17:40,072 --> 00:17:44,952
So Kinkaku and Ginkaku
had some of your chakra.

238
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:51,028
<i>But given that they're just fragments
of Eight-Tails' and my chakra,</i>

239
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,740
<i>who knows what form or shape
the revived Ten-Tails will take.</i>

240
00:17:55,504 --> 00:17:58,799
We must act before Ten-Tails
fully comes back to life.

241
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:03,207
<i>Old Man Six Paths used to say
that Ten-Tails' full revival</i>

242
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:07,002
<i>would signify the end of the world.</i>

243
00:18:07,721 --> 00:18:09,748
Is the Ten-Tails really that terrible?

244
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:14,885
I get that he's got Ten-Tails,
but just how powerful is he?

245
00:18:15,882 --> 00:18:20,148
<i>He's the aggregate of the chakra of all
the Tailed Beasts, One-Tail through me.</i>

246
00:18:20,401 --> 00:18:24,280
<i>He was the beginning of chakra
and a creator-god of many nations.</i>

247
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:30,369
<i>Amenohitotsunokami...
Datara... Daidarabotchi...</i>

248
00:18:30,497 --> 00:18:32,207
<i>He has many names.</i>

249
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:36,077
<i>He drank oceans, split open the
earth, and hoisted up mountains...</i>

250
00:18:36,102 --> 00:18:39,439
<i>He is the progenitor who is said
to have created this very land.</i>

251
00:18:42,474 --> 00:18:46,478
<i>Simply put, he has the total power
of all nine Tailed Beasts.</i>

252
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,529
<i>Honestly, I couldn't take him on
by myself and hope to win.</i>

253
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:58,266
<i>But if he only has a piece
of Eight-Tails and me,</i>

254
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,794
<i>who has the most chakra
out of the nine...</i>

255
00:19:00,819 --> 00:19:02,821
<i>it might be worth a try.</i>

256
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,855
You're all mistaken.

257
00:19:08,725 --> 00:19:13,063
For me, the revival of Ten-Tails
doesn't need to be complete.

258
00:19:16,749 --> 00:19:19,543
My end goal is a super genjutsu...

259
00:19:19,636 --> 00:19:21,346
The Infinite Tsukuyomi!

260
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:27,082
I will put every human on
this planet under a single genjutsu...

261
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,710
A single world that belongs
to nobody.

262
00:19:30,443 --> 00:19:34,739
One perfect world
without war or ill feelings.

263
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,510
Only within a single
collective consciousness...

264
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,971
where the individual has been
cast aside, can truth be found!

265
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:48,665
The world no longer needs hope,
a future or famous heroes.

266
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:52,038
Even if incomplete,
once Ten-Tails is revived,

267
00:19:52,063 --> 00:19:54,356
the Infinite Tsukuyomi jutsu
can be achieved.

268
00:19:54,806 --> 00:19:57,141
Then reality will come to an end...

269
00:19:57,494 --> 00:20:01,748
And all that will exist will be
a single unending dream...

270
00:20:01,773 --> 00:20:03,066
that will last for all eternity!

271
00:20:42,602 --> 00:20:49,108
I had Dad, Mom, and Pervy Sage.

272
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,175
Kids love looking up to their hero.

273
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:07,724
That's why I can keep running
forward without hesitation.

274
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:14,898
I will become the greatest Hokage
of them all!

275
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,069
That's my dream!

276
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,043
I guess cracking that mask of yours
will have to come first.

277
00:21:38,361 --> 00:21:40,238
You will not touch the statue!

278
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,460
Naruto! You know about
his abilities, right?

279
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:18,295
Your window of opportunity is the instant
he tries to suck you inside himself.

280
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,422
That's when he's solid.

281
00:22:20,668 --> 00:22:23,754
If you attack him normally,
you'll just pass right through him.

282
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:25,781
So it's like you're aiming
for a counterattack.

283
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,387
Diversionary tactics are a must.

284
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,514
Create an opening through
continuous close combat!

285
00:22:29,664 --> 00:22:31,582
Avoid using big moves!

286
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:35,437
I know!
That's why I made a clone!

287
00:22:35,462 --> 00:22:38,131
Bee! Please raise me up high!

288
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,194
<i>I'm good to go.</i>

289
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:45,364
<i>We should avoid attacks
that touch him directly.</i>

290
00:22:45,567 --> 00:22:47,361
Up you go!

291
00:22:49,987 --> 00:22:51,905
<i>Super Mini Tailed Beast Bomb!</i>

292
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,372
<i>Mangekyo Sharingan!</i>

293
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,582
<i>Twin Fangs!</i>

294
00:23:06,682 --> 00:23:07,850
<i>This one!</i>

295
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,890
<i>I guess not.
Then it must be...</i>

296
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,042
<i>Nice timing!</i>

297
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:48,975
I'll deal with you...

298
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,056
first!

299
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,117
<i>That's so cool,
Bushier Brow-sensei!</i>

300
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:17,038
<i>Okay! I've infused more
than enough chakra!</i>

301
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:18,832
<i>Sorry, but...</i>

302
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,420
<i>I'm going for the statue!</i>

303
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:24,939
<i>Kamui!</i>

304
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:28,300
<i>If I gouge out its head...</i>

305
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:31,011
<i>it shouldn't be able to survive,
statue or not!</i>

306
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,439
So naïve.

307
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,977
<i>What happened?</i>

308
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,663
He vanished?

309
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:05,716
Naruto!

310
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,716
<i>These boulders are in the way!
Damn it!</i>

311
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:11,510
Bee!

312
00:25:11,535 --> 00:25:12,703
I've got it!

313
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,734
Fly!

314
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,777
<i>He cut through that boulder
with his Lightning Blade.</i>

315
00:25:29,802 --> 00:25:30,886
<i>Nice, Kakashi!</i>

316
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,687
<i>I'm not going to make it in time!</i>

317
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,880
Naruto! Just keep going!

318
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,757
I'll take care of the kunai!

319
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:58,640
<i>Kamui!</i>

320
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,563
<i>Damn it!</i>

321
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:09,234
He's really strong.
I can't get my attacks to hit him.

322
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,443
Are you all right?

323
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:11,486
Yeah...

324
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:15,031
But if even that attack is no good...

325
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,576
What can we do?!

326
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,762
What's happening all of
a sudden?

327
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,767
Hey, Kakashi...
Did you see that?

328
00:26:43,154 --> 00:26:44,447
– Yeah.
– Huh?

329
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,230
There's a crack in his mask.

330
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:50,483
Huh? Where, where?!

331
00:26:53,585 --> 00:26:56,036
You're right... On the left side!

332
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,532
Looks like Naruto's earlier attack
grazed him

333
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:00,160
before it passed through!

334
00:27:00,514 --> 00:27:03,350
Nice going, Naruto!
Let's keep it up just like that!

335
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:08,084
All right! Now I feel like
we have a chance!

336
00:27:08,443 --> 00:27:12,990
To be honest, it didn't look to me
like Naruto's attack landed.

337
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,162
You're doing it again...

338
00:27:15,187 --> 00:27:16,628
You always say things like that!

339
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,678
Are you saying
it was something else?

340
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:19,763
What's going on?

341
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,353
You're wide open!

342
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:27,687
Don't mock me!

343
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,398
<i>Uchiha Flame Formation!</i>

344
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,569
Hot! Hot! Hot!

345
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:36,988
Whoa!

346
00:27:38,661 --> 00:27:41,497
Are you all right,
Octopops and Eight-Tails?!

347
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:43,995
Do I look all right?

348
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,498
Now that he's erected a barrier,

349
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:49,542
we have no choice but
to tackle the masked guy first.

350
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,504
That's been my plan since
the beginning, y'know!

351
00:27:52,762 --> 00:27:54,055
Damn it!

352
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,718
It's no use just thinking about it.

353
00:27:59,764 --> 00:28:03,309
<i>It's an implausible theory,
but it's not impossible, either...</i>

354
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:07,060
Guy, Naruto, Bee...

355
00:28:07,386 --> 00:28:08,387
– Yeah?
– Hmm?

356
00:28:08,946 --> 00:28:10,531
There's something I want to test.

357
00:28:11,409 --> 00:28:12,410
Help me out.

358
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,409
Let's do it!

359
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,451
Okay!

360
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,331
Yo!

361
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,012
Impressive destructive power.

362
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:46,182
How's that?!

363
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:48,309
You don't have any time
to suck me in, do you?!

364
00:28:53,543 --> 00:28:55,378
You underestimate
the Sharingan too much.

365
00:28:55,577 --> 00:28:57,037
I can read your movements.

366
00:28:57,966 --> 00:28:59,676
I'll keep these.

367
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:03,158
<i>He materializes while
he absorbs things.</i>

368
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,200
Now!

369
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,660
<i>Rasengan!</i>

370
00:29:05,863 --> 00:29:08,199
Don't you understand
that it's futile?

371
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,070
It's just like you said, Kakashi-sensei!

372
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,405
I don't really understand why,

373
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,199
but I finally landed
an attack on him!

374
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:46,367
I knew it...

375
00:29:46,756 --> 00:29:48,261
I thought he was using
two different jutsu:

376
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:51,390
One that lets him phase through things,
and one to absorb or expel targets.

377
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:52,271
But that's not the case.

378
00:29:52,296 --> 00:29:53,297
– Huh?
– Huh?

379
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,503
It's all one single jutsu!

380
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,897
It's one jutsu?

381
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:04,427
Yeah.

382
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:08,306
Well, no one's better at jutsu analysis
and breakdown than you.

383
00:30:08,518 --> 00:30:11,688
Can you explain his jutsu
to us in simpler terms?

384
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:16,523
Knowing what it is might change
how we approach the battle.

385
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:19,442
The way his jutsu works
is really simple...

386
00:30:20,165 --> 00:30:23,585
You see, the jutsu he uses
to absorb things,

387
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:27,649
and the one he uses to slip through
objects is Time-Space Ninjutsu.

388
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:32,038
What do you mean?
How can you tell?

389
00:30:32,516 --> 00:30:33,292
Well...

390
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,209
Let me explain it in order.

391
00:30:37,231 --> 00:30:39,817
First, the crack in his mask.

392
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:44,553
My kunai made that mark.
I'm absolutely certain.

393
00:30:46,419 --> 00:30:48,474
From the look of the wound
on his right shoulder,

394
00:30:48,499 --> 00:30:52,044
I can tell it was caused from being hit
by Naruto's Rasengan just now.

395
00:30:53,416 --> 00:30:55,918
What these two things have
in common is that

396
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:59,816
they both involve areas of his body
that were overlapping

397
00:30:59,841 --> 00:31:03,428
and in contact with Naruto's body
while he was slipping through him.

398
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:05,839
Never mind that!

399
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,784
Why did your kunai hit
and not my punch?

400
00:31:11,859 --> 00:31:14,862
Although it looks like your attack
slipped right through him,

401
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:18,543
in fact, only the part of his body
that would have been

402
00:31:18,985 --> 00:31:21,847
in contact with yours
was transported into time-space.

403
00:31:22,722 --> 00:31:25,016
In other words,
the left side of his mask

404
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:29,253
that your punch "passed through"
was simply transported

405
00:31:29,311 --> 00:31:33,816
into time-space and
no longer existed on this dimension.

406
00:31:34,717 --> 00:31:35,551
At least materially.

407
00:31:36,107 --> 00:31:38,192
And then almost simultaneously,

408
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:41,582
remember I hurled that kunai
into time-space using Kamui?

409
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:49,946
Just as his momentum
carried him forward

410
00:31:50,089 --> 00:31:53,453
when he extended his arm
toward you to grab you...

411
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:58,861
my kunai finished entering time-space
and scored his mask.

412
00:31:58,886 --> 00:32:01,013
Did the same thing happen
with the Rasengan?

413
00:32:01,181 --> 00:32:02,182
Yeah...

414
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,350
So that's what happened.

415
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,089
But how come both of
your visual abilities are linked?

416
00:32:19,816 --> 00:32:21,759
Where did you get that eye?!

417
00:32:23,557 --> 00:32:24,767
Where, huh?

418
00:32:27,482 --> 00:32:30,151
If anything,
in the last Great War.

419
00:32:32,477 --> 00:32:34,520
The Battle of Kannabi Bridge...

420
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:40,333
The same battle where you earned
the nickname "The Sharingan Hero."

421
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:42,835
Are you...?

422
00:32:44,102 --> 00:32:47,397
I thought I told you not
to flap your mouth so readily!

423
00:32:48,236 --> 00:32:53,449
You're just all talk now!
Your words are worthless!

424
00:32:55,762 --> 00:32:58,002
It's too late for regrets.

425
00:32:58,027 --> 00:33:01,698
Reality just keeps cruelly
moving ahead.

426
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:06,884
You've seen reality,
so you ought to know.

427
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:10,053
Not one wish ever gets granted
in this world.

428
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:13,867
That's why I'm guiding it to
the dream of Infinite Tsukuyomi.

429
00:33:14,578 --> 00:33:17,664
I'm going to create a world
where it won't be necessary

430
00:33:17,689 --> 00:33:21,818
for a hero to pathetically make excuses
in front of a grave.

431
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,877
Hey, are you all right, Kakashi?!

432
00:33:25,945 --> 00:33:27,113
You bastard!

433
00:33:27,657 --> 00:33:29,659
Are you still blabbing on
about that?!

434
00:33:31,447 --> 00:33:33,157
I thought I told you too!

435
00:33:33,394 --> 00:33:35,522
I'm not giving up my dream
of becoming Hokage!

436
00:33:35,737 --> 00:33:38,573
I've been entrusted with way too much
from way too many!

437
00:33:40,023 --> 00:33:41,400
Entrusted, eh?

438
00:33:42,412 --> 00:33:49,634
What if you were to lose the things Jiraiya
and the Fourth Hokage entrusted you with?

439
00:33:50,693 --> 00:33:52,904
I wonder what they would think?

440
00:33:55,547 --> 00:33:59,217
Naruto, if you fail at the things
you were entrusted with...

441
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:02,708
I wonder what you will think
of yourself as well?

442
00:34:07,965 --> 00:34:12,688
If you postpone dealing with problems
and cover it up with the word "hope,"

443
00:34:12,987 --> 00:34:15,490
all that awaits you is
an empty reality.

444
00:34:15,935 --> 00:34:20,815
Both one entrusted, and those
who entrusted him... all in vain.

445
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,565
<i>Naruto, switch with me!</i>

446
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,360
<i>There's something I want
to say to him.</i>

447
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:43,539
<i>Sorry, but your words
don't apply to this guy.</i>

448
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,541
Is that Nine-Tails?

449
00:34:46,069 --> 00:34:48,322
<i>The Fourth Hokage entrusted him
with me.</i>

450
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:52,508
<i>Not only has Naruto
befriended me...</i>

451
00:34:52,696 --> 00:34:54,573
<i>but he's completely mastered
my power as well!</i>

452
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:04,018
<i>The Fourth Hokage sealed me
within Naruto</i>

453
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,687
<i>as a force to help take you down.</i>

454
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,111
<i>Go... Naruto.</i>

455
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:16,587
<i>You won't fail!</i>

456
00:35:16,612 --> 00:35:17,613
Yeah!

457
00:35:23,124 --> 00:35:24,834
That power again, huh?

458
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:41,365
Kakashi, we ought to—!

459
00:35:43,288 --> 00:35:46,041
That man, he couldn't be...

460
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,154
I've got a pretty good idea
of what you're thinking right now.

461
00:35:56,396 --> 00:35:57,397
I feel the same way...

462
00:35:58,003 --> 00:35:59,546
But leave it be.

463
00:36:00,092 --> 00:36:02,052
There's no time to wallow
in sentimentality.

464
00:36:02,876 --> 00:36:06,088
Your former subordinate, Naruto,
has already jumped into action!

465
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:10,376
How stupid, jumping in alone!

466
00:36:12,149 --> 00:36:13,233
Yo! Yo!

467
00:36:13,448 --> 00:36:14,658
Damn it!

468
00:36:22,955 --> 00:36:25,249
I'm not alone!

469
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,356
Don't forget Kurama!

470
00:36:28,005 --> 00:36:29,923
There's also Octopops and Eight-Tails...

471
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,856
Bushier Brow-sensei!

472
00:36:31,911 --> 00:36:33,329
And Kakashi-sensei too!

473
00:36:38,607 --> 00:36:39,650
<i>Naruto...</i>

474
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:42,491
<i>I'm glad you were
my subordinate!</i>

475
00:36:42,877 --> 00:36:44,366
Let's go... Guy!

476
00:36:45,683 --> 00:36:46,976
My dear rival!

477
00:36:47,101 --> 00:36:48,769
That's what I'm talking about!

478
00:36:50,895 --> 00:36:52,855
<i>Considering my remaining chakra...</i>

479
00:36:53,122 --> 00:36:54,790
<i>I only have a few shots left.</i>

480
00:36:56,047 --> 00:37:00,051
I do not fear a borrowed power that
you can't even use in rapid succession.

481
00:37:01,088 --> 00:37:03,632
The true power of Kamui...

482
00:37:03,657 --> 00:37:04,825
<i>This Kamui...</i>

483
00:37:04,906 --> 00:37:06,658
<i>I will not miss...</i>

484
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:08,018
– Now watch and learn!
– <i>my timing!</i>

485
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:16,108
<i>Their knowing the trick to
my jutsu changes nothing.</i>

486
00:37:18,511 --> 00:37:20,513
If he has to materialize
when he takes things in,

487
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:22,290
he has to do so when
he spits things out too!

488
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,033
This is our chance!

489
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,082
That's if you can counterstrike!

490
00:37:30,504 --> 00:37:31,922
What is this?

491
00:37:33,388 --> 00:37:34,342
Naruto!

492
00:37:34,367 --> 00:37:37,245
These have Curse Marks on them
that restrain Tailed Beast power.

493
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:40,711
Whatever you do, don't touch it!

494
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,305
Octopops!

495
00:37:42,851 --> 00:37:44,644
Could you shield me for a bit?

496
00:37:45,203 --> 00:37:46,704
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

497
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:51,060
All right, come here!
I'll be your umbrella!

498
00:37:58,952 --> 00:37:59,860
<i>Kamui!</i>

499
00:38:02,601 --> 00:38:04,520
<i>If it's that same trick again,</i>

500
00:38:04,809 --> 00:38:07,353
<i>all I need to do is not have
Naruto slip through me.</i>

501
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,789
<i>What? A Shadow Clone?</i>

502
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,321
Kakashi!

503
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:20,965
Seems my attack was
quicker than you, Kakashi.

504
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,801
You missed transporting away
the Rasengan...

505
00:38:24,688 --> 00:38:26,982
... and wasted another Kamui.

506
00:38:27,633 --> 00:38:28,634
Not yet!

507
00:38:28,666 --> 00:38:30,251
<i>Tailed Beast Bomb!</i>

508
00:38:30,727 --> 00:38:33,563
<i>A bit late. How futile.</i>

509
00:38:48,972 --> 00:38:50,099
You're—!

510
00:38:50,462 --> 00:38:52,464
Naruto Uzumaki!

511
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:57,044
<i>I see, so that Kamui just now
wasn't transporting the Rasengan,</i>

512
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:59,648
<i>but the Shadow Clone itself!</i>

513
00:38:59,673 --> 00:39:02,412
<i>He beat me to it...
Damn you, Kakashi!</i>

514
00:39:02,937 --> 00:39:04,105
Who...

515
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,271
Damn it!

516
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,306
... are you?!

517
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:15,436
<i>Whatever the village
or anyone else may say...</i>

518
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,773
<i>I think that you're a great Jonin...</i>

519
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:22,401
<i>It's true, that's how I feel.</i>

520
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,862
<i>Please accept this...</i>

521
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,130
There's no mistake.

522
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,967
That's Obito Uchiha...

523
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,639
You can call me by
that name if you want.

524
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,433
It means nothing to me.

525
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:56,519
Who is he?

526
00:39:56,779 --> 00:40:00,449
He was our classmate and
an Uchiha who was a Leaf shinobi.

527
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,371
We all thought he was killed
in action during the last war.

528
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:08,406
If you survived, why didn't you
come forward sooner?

529
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:13,160
It's irrelevant whether
I had survived or not.

530
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:16,914
Although, I suppose...

531
00:40:18,157 --> 00:40:20,405
If you really want an answer...

532
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,463
It's because...

533
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,174
you let Rin...

534
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,260
die.

535
00:40:33,499 --> 00:40:34,750
Relax...

536
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:38,504
Besides, what's with
that look, Kakashi?

537
00:40:44,728 --> 00:40:46,730
You're not going to condemn me?

538
00:40:47,408 --> 00:40:51,287
What would I gain from criticizing
this absurd reality at this point?

539
00:40:53,641 --> 00:40:57,145
I have no interest in the affairs of a
world that shall soon cease to exist.

540
00:40:59,702 --> 00:41:00,703
Kakashi-sensei!

541
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:04,086
I don't know what went down
between you two,

542
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,338
but this is no time to be depressed!

543
00:41:06,938 --> 00:41:08,841
We can discuss it later!

544
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:13,220
Right now, stopping what this guy
is trying to do comes first!

545
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,222
<i>Naruto!</i>

546
00:41:15,771 --> 00:41:17,898
Kakashi! Naruto is absolutely right!

547
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,270
The fate of this world currently
rests in our hands!

548
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,690
I have nothing more
to talk to you about.

549
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:28,110
Stay tied down to reality and die...

550
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:29,487
<i>Fire Style:</i>

551
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,363
<i>Bomb Blast Dance!</i>

552
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:41,415
The Nine-Tails' tail, huh?

553
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,641
Huh? What the—?!

554
00:42:03,246 --> 00:42:05,248
Looks like you're having fun
over here...

555
00:42:09,386 --> 00:42:10,471
Obito.

556
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:14,573
That's...

557
00:42:15,732 --> 00:42:20,612
It's just like you... to have defied
the Reanimation Jutsu.

558
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:24,291
More importantly,
what's taking so long?

559
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,962
Why? Why is that Madara over here?

560
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,632
He's a Shadow Clone too...

561
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:34,301
Where's the real one, Obito?

562
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,972
What's happened to
everyone over there?

563
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,725
Brother...

564
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:44,311
He's over there, eh?

565
00:42:46,811 --> 00:42:48,688
I asked you what happened?!

566
00:42:49,614 --> 00:42:51,908
I'm not sure, but I suspect...

567
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,451
... that none of them are doing too well.

568
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,420
<i>Summoning... Jutsu!</i>

569
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,174
Lady Tsunade!

570
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:18,721
Katsuyu... Do something for me...

571
00:43:19,228 --> 00:43:21,230
Yes! I'll reattach your body right away...

572
00:43:21,255 --> 00:43:22,256
No...

573
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,935
My lower body can wait.

574
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:27,938
First...

575
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:33,235
Bring the other Kage... to me...

576
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:37,740
I... can... still save them.

577
00:43:43,317 --> 00:43:45,778
<i>Faster than the Curse Mark Chains
can wrap around!</i>

578
00:43:47,946 --> 00:43:50,073
I'll return that to you.
It's yours to begin with.

579
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,102
<i>Finally, I can move!</i>

580
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:08,896
<i>Thanks, Naruto!</i>

581
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,774
<i>Now, it's my turn!</i>

582
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:20,532
Obito, did you launch
the plan haphazardly

583
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:22,951
before you even took in
the Eight and Nine-Tails?

584
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:26,955
<i>He knows about the plan...</i>

585
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,166
<i>What's their relationship?</i>

586
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,960
You were hasty, Obito.

587
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:36,131
Is that also why I was revived
in this form?

588
00:44:42,226 --> 00:44:44,228
Well, knowing you...

589
00:44:44,262 --> 00:44:46,723
I'm sure you have something in mind.

590
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,977
What have you been up to
all this time?

591
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:50,312
Where's Nagato?

592
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,989
You were supposed to determine
the appropriate moment

593
00:44:54,014 --> 00:44:56,110
and bring me back to life
with Rinne Rebirth.

594
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:58,362
That was the agreement.

595
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:00,114
He betrayed us.

596
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,700
He used the jutsu to revive
the Leaf villagers.

597
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:04,576
I can't depend on any of you.

598
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:08,706
Well, no matter...
It's still not too late.

599
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:12,084
I'll capture the Eight and Nine-Tails!

600
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:15,921
Dead men shouldn't go around
messing things up!

601
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:27,850
<i>Huh?!</i>

602
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,351
<i>It didn't explode?!</i>

603
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:34,440
<i>Uchiha Reflection.</i>

604
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,662
I'll get the Eight and Nine-Tails.

605
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:51,290
Obito, you take down those two.

606
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:56,211
Obito...

607
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:58,338
What happened to you?

608
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,798
Why would you join up with him?

609
00:46:10,089 --> 00:46:14,075
<i>Am I... dead?</i>

610
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,277
Where am I?

611
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:24,740
In between this life and the next...
young Uchiha.

612
00:46:28,417 --> 00:46:29,459
<i>Those eyes!</i>

613
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:32,289
No way, Gramps...
You're an Uchiha too?

614
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,501
Well, perhaps.

615
00:46:36,332 --> 00:46:38,459
<i>He rescued me?</i>

616
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,255
<i>But wait...</i>

617
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:43,175
You said we're between
this life and the next.

618
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,310
Where are we?

619
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:47,045
It's dark and I can't see so well.

620
00:46:47,392 --> 00:46:49,603
Anyway, who are you, Gramps?

621
00:46:50,717 --> 00:46:53,678
Heh! Don't tell me you're Death!

622
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,605
The guy who escorts people
to heaven or hell...

623
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:00,526
Nooo!

624
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:03,732
I don't want to die yet! Help!

625
00:47:03,893 --> 00:47:05,522
I just saw a scythe or something!

626
00:47:05,547 --> 00:47:07,424
You're Death for sure!

627
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:10,285
One especially for the Uchiha!

628
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:15,624
Wait! I lived my life by the motto
of helping the elderly in need!

629
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:19,545
Sure, I caused a lot of mischief
and broke a lot of rules...

630
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,964
But I'm sure my scale tips
on the positive side!

631
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,633
Please don't take me to hell!

632
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:25,884
Oww...

633
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:30,931
The fact that you feel pain
means you're still alive.

634
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:35,853
However, it's a miracle
that you survived.

635
00:47:36,706 --> 00:47:39,208
I'm amazed you weren't completely
crushed under those boulders.

636
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:43,861
It's almost as if you passed
right through them.

637
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,698
Where did you find me?

638
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:51,285
In an underground passageway
I had created...

639
00:47:51,651 --> 00:47:53,945
collapsed next to crumbled rock.

640
00:47:54,574 --> 00:47:58,829
Still, half your body
had been crushed.

641
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:02,546
I patched you up as best I could.

642
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:04,631
So you saved me, Gramps.

643
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:07,467
Thank you.

644
00:48:07,786 --> 00:48:10,121
It's too soon to thank me.

645
00:48:10,573 --> 00:48:14,202
I expect you to repay
your debt to me.

646
00:48:14,977 --> 00:48:18,897
After all, helping the elderly
is your motto, right?

647
00:48:19,208 --> 00:48:21,419
Well, yeah.

648
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:24,526
So what do you want me to do?

649
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,004
Help you with bathroom stuff?

650
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:28,363
That would be good.

651
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:32,784
Sorry, but I can't stay here forever!

652
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,495
Now that I know I'm alive,

653
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:37,164
I'm going back home to
the Hidden Leaf Village.

654
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:39,416
There's a war going on.

655
00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:41,684
My Sharingan's finally
awakened...

656
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:45,339
So now, I'll be able to protect
my comrades even better!

657
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:49,468
Protect your comrades better, eh...?

658
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,178
What is it?

659
00:48:51,541 --> 00:48:56,045
With that body...
your life as a shinobi is over.

660
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:58,226
No, no, no!

661
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:01,229
Finally... I finally got this eye!

662
00:49:01,685 --> 00:49:05,859
I'm confident my attack combinations
will be better now!

663
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,779
Wake up to reality.

664
00:49:09,938 --> 00:49:13,617
Nothing ever goes as
planned in this world.

665
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:16,578
The longer you live,
the more you realize that

666
00:49:16,819 --> 00:49:23,159
only pain, suffering,
and futility exist in this reality.

667
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:26,004
<i>What's with this old man...?</i>

668
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:27,422
Listen to me...

669
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:31,593
In this world, wherever there is light,

670
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,637
there are always shadows.

671
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:36,723
As long as there is
a concept of victors,

672
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:39,643
the vanquished will also exist.

673
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:44,690
The selfish desire for peace
gives rise to war.

674
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:48,694
And hatred is born in order
to protect love.

675
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:51,029
These are all nexuses,

676
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:53,448
causal relationships that
cannot be separated.

677
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:55,409
Normally, that is.

678
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:57,619
<i>The old man's on a roll...</i>

679
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:00,372
<i>Old people ramble forever
once they start.</i>

680
00:50:00,783 --> 00:50:02,952
So... where are we anyway?

681
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:07,879
Because you were hurt,
someone else was saved.

682
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,090
Isn't that so?

683
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,304
Shut up already!

684
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:19,307
I don't want to stay here long!

685
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,475
I have to...

686
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:24,938
Leave if you really want to.

687
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,983
If you can move, that is.

688
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:33,739
<i>Wait a minute...</i>

689
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:36,562
<i>There's something weird
about this.</i>

690
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:40,912
<i>What's an old man with the Sharingan
doing here all by himself?</i>

691
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,665
<i>If I think about it,</i>

692
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:47,318
<i>I know all the old folks
in the Hidden Leaf Village.</i>

693
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:50,047
<i>and if I've never seen him around...</i>

694
00:50:51,244 --> 00:50:54,873
<i>It means this guy is currently
not a Leaf shinobi.</i>

695
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:56,803
<i>Which means...</i>

696
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,474
Gramps... I bet...

697
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,225
you're a rogue ninja, aren't you?

698
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:04,144
Just who are you?!

699
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:18,450
I am... an Uchiha ghost.

700
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:22,245
I am Madara Uchiha.

701
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:25,123
<i>M-Madara...?!</i>

702
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,584
By Madara...

703
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:31,129
You mean Madara Uchiha,
as in my ancestor?!

704
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:35,217
That Madara's supposed to
have died ages ago!

705
00:51:35,242 --> 00:51:36,994
What era are we talking about?!

706
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:43,350
So you're more likely to
believe that I'm Death?

707
00:51:45,038 --> 00:51:49,126
I guess I am Death, in a sense...

708
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:54,444
For this reality, truly is hell.

709
00:51:56,238 --> 00:52:00,325
I'm a cheater of death who
would be dead in no time...

710
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:04,412
if I weren't continuously
siphoning chakra

711
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:07,249
from that Gedo Statue behind me.

712
00:52:15,135 --> 00:52:16,469
I'm going home!

713
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:24,141
I wouldn't bother.
There are no exits here.

714
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:29,729
In any case, neither you
nor I can leave this place.

715
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:32,983
At least, not with our bodies.

716
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:39,614
If you move, the synthetic tissue
of Hashirama

717
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:42,159
that I went to the trouble of
attaching to you will peel off.

718
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,202
Do you want to die?

719
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:49,124
There are a lot of things
I'd like you to do for me,

720
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,251
for the rest of our lives.

721
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,337
I went to great pains to save you.

722
00:52:54,556 --> 00:52:56,266
Don't rush to your death.

723
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,275
What do you want?

724
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:02,762
What does a geezer like you want
from a brat like me?!

725
00:53:03,642 --> 00:53:07,188
To sever the fate of this world.

726
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:11,813
A world of only victors...

727
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:16,401
a world of only peace...
a world of only love.

728
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:20,864
I will create such a world.

729
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,200
So what! Who cares!

730
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:27,954
I just want to go back to everyone!

731
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:33,418
I told you, things don't go
as planned.

732
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:37,339
You will realize that in time.

733
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:44,638
If you really want to die so badly,
then go ahead.

734
00:53:44,802 --> 00:53:47,764
But I'll be taking that Sharingan
of yours.

735
00:53:50,577 --> 00:53:52,454
Why do you want my eye?!

736
00:53:52,496 --> 00:53:55,582
You already have
your own Sharingan!

737
00:53:55,607 --> 00:54:01,154
Actually, I gave my original eyes
to someone else.

738
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:05,033
These are merely spares
I transplanted later.

739
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:08,828
I'd like to have a few more in stock...

740
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:12,582
Since I don't have a right eye yet.

741
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:18,338
And only with two together can
the Sharingan's true power be unleashed.

742
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:21,383
<i>Then... that means...</i>

743
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:24,469
<i>If I team up with Kakashi,
we'll both be even stronger.</i>

744
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:28,431
<i>Then we'll be able to
protect Rin properly, together!</i>

745
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:31,768
<i>I definitely can't stay here.</i>

746
00:54:32,898 --> 00:54:36,652
<i>Just you wait... Kakashi... Rin!</i>

747
00:54:38,526 --> 00:54:39,611
<i>I'm...</i>

748
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,654
<i>alive!</i>

749
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:04,551
Hey there.

750
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:07,345
How are you doing?

751
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:11,405
Bad... What do you think?

752
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:16,021
How long have I been here?

753
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,356
It feels like it's been a while.

754
00:55:18,968 --> 00:55:22,388
Don't worry,
you don't need to pay rent.

755
00:55:22,954 --> 00:55:27,626
Those of us created from
the Gedo Statue don't have to eat either.

756
00:55:27,748 --> 00:55:30,167
No food bills,
no need for a bathroom.

757
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:32,454
We don't even poo!

758
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:36,541
Don't lump me in with you guys!

759
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:41,254
I just have half of that weird stuff
stuck onto me.

760
00:55:41,279 --> 00:55:45,742
And thanks to that, you can survive
without eating or drinking.

761
00:55:45,925 --> 00:55:49,346
In fact, you should be grateful
and thank us.

762
00:55:49,578 --> 00:55:53,255
Good grief. We're the ones who don't want
to be lumped in with you!

763
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,660
What you have is
emotionless synth-tissue.

764
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:59,356
We are full artificial humans.
We have feelings and everything!

765
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:03,651
You may have a better sense of humor,
but what we have is much better!

766
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:08,365
Both our vocabulary skills and
mental acuity are far higher than yours!

767
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,575
But we don't poo...

768
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:11,743
Shut up!

769
00:56:12,197 --> 00:56:16,326
All right, explain how you're at
a higher level than I am!

770
00:56:20,165 --> 00:56:20,833
We are...

771
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:21,544
The ones...

772
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:22,837
– in charge of watching you!
– in charge of watching you!

773
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:25,548
Don't talk in synch!
That pisses me off!

774
00:56:26,036 --> 00:56:28,080
We're only helping you
with your rehab

775
00:56:28,105 --> 00:56:31,316
because Madara ordered us
to get you up and running

776
00:56:31,341 --> 00:56:34,844
and usable by the time he wakes up.

777
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:39,952
So he makes these noisy puppets
keep an eye on me...

778
00:56:39,977 --> 00:56:42,021
while he gets to sleep
the whole time?

779
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:49,531
I swear I'm going to get outta here
and return to Rin and Kakashi!

780
00:56:49,931 --> 00:56:51,391
Where's the exit?

781
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:54,577
Can't be done... there's no exit.

782
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:58,331
Madara sealed it off
with a huge boulder...

783
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:01,292
after we lugged you here
on his orders.

784
00:57:01,317 --> 00:57:02,944
What?! He sealed us in?!

785
00:57:03,752 --> 00:57:08,256
By the way, you've been saying
"Rin-Rin-Rin" in your sleep a lot.

786
00:57:08,431 --> 00:57:11,247
Do you want to go outside to
get a bell or something?

787
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:14,989
Once in a while,
you said "stupid-stupid-stupid.”

788
00:57:15,115 --> 00:57:16,825
And "stupid Kakashi."

789
00:57:16,989 --> 00:57:19,783
Yeah, yeah, that's right!
Every so often.

790
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,105
What's a "stupid Kakashi"?

791
00:57:22,130 --> 00:57:24,578
Beats me. Why don't you ask him?

792
00:57:26,047 --> 00:57:29,050
<i>Was I really saying that?</i>

793
00:57:33,988 --> 00:57:37,232
Um, may we ask you a question!

794
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:38,746
What?

795
00:57:38,817 --> 00:57:40,069
When nature calls...

796
00:57:40,094 --> 00:57:43,931
In short, what does the urge
to poo feel like?

797
00:57:43,956 --> 00:57:44,999
For example...

798
00:57:45,093 --> 00:57:46,677
I thought you wanted to know
about stupid Kakashi!

799
00:57:46,702 --> 00:57:49,372
Why are you guys so obsessed
with poop?

800
00:57:50,204 --> 00:57:53,374
You don't have to get so angry.

801
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:57,140
All right, we'll ask you about
Rin and stupid Kakashi later.

802
00:57:57,165 --> 00:57:59,209
Especially you, with the swirly face...

803
00:57:59,234 --> 00:58:01,779
You don't poop,
but you look like poop.

804
00:58:02,214 --> 00:58:03,299
I hate you!

805
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:07,358
Anyway, where'd the other white guys go?

806
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:10,737
They went outside to collect intel.

807
00:58:10,789 --> 00:58:13,750
What?! You guys can get out?

808
00:58:14,254 --> 00:58:18,175
It's because we can move
through the ground.

809
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:21,346
What the hell?!

810
00:58:22,179 --> 00:58:24,890
I'm locked up in here,

811
00:58:25,307 --> 00:58:27,642
and I have to hear about all
this weird stuff.

812
00:58:27,693 --> 00:58:29,779
So sorry to have bothered you
about poo!

813
00:58:29,804 --> 00:58:31,431
That's not what I meant!

814
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:34,636
I mean, what Madara talked about!

815
00:58:34,974 --> 00:58:37,393
Something about severing fate
and all...

816
00:58:37,787 --> 00:58:38,704
Oh, that...

817
00:58:38,842 --> 00:58:43,555
Madara's not nice enough to talk
to a brat at his level.

818
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:49,666
Simply put, he's talking about discarding
all the bad things in the real world and

819
00:58:49,691 --> 00:58:53,403
escaping inside a dream
that's full of good things!

820
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,156
Inside a dream?

821
00:58:55,366 --> 00:58:58,577
Since it's a dream,
everything is how you want it!

822
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:01,579
Even those who are dead
can be alive again!

823
00:59:02,727 --> 00:59:03,770
Yeah...

824
00:59:03,795 --> 00:59:07,341
Just think of it as all of us going
to this huge dream world

825
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:10,421
that was created using genjutsu!

826
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:14,425
Well, it's more like forcibly
taking everyone there...

827
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:16,469
and for life too.

828
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,179
With genjutsu?

829
00:59:20,257 --> 00:59:23,427
That's so beyond stupid,
I can't even understand it.

830
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:28,987
If you have as much power as Madara,
anything is possible.

831
00:59:29,012 --> 00:59:31,723
It's just that he's weak right now
and can't do it yet.

832
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:34,904
Much still needs to be prepared.

833
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:38,449
Oh really? Well, I'm not interested.

834
00:59:39,147 --> 00:59:40,398
More importantly...

835
00:59:41,139 --> 00:59:44,017
I swear I'm going to make it outside!

836
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:49,919
And get back to Rin and Kakashi!

837
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:51,921
What?

838
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:55,179
I've got to get this body working again...

839
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:22,970
Yaaaay!

840
01:02:14,299 --> 01:02:15,300
What?!

841
01:02:53,857 --> 01:02:56,192
<i>Don't act tough and hide your wounds!</i>

842
01:02:57,365 --> 01:02:59,158
<i>I'm always watching, you know.</i>

843
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,204
<i>It's starting to feel natural.</i>

844
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:14,332
<i>Just a bit longer.</i>

845
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:18,669
<i>I'll see you soon, Rin... Kakashi!</i>

846
01:03:22,755 --> 01:03:25,133
I was just outside!

847
01:03:25,254 --> 01:03:28,090
Your friends, Rin and
stupid Kakashi, are in trouble!

848
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:29,514
What happened?!

849
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:33,518
They're alone and completely
surrounded by Hidden Mist shinobi!

850
01:03:46,454 --> 01:03:50,332
You can't break through boulders
with that body yet.

851
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:54,288
I have to save Rin and Kakashi...

852
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:02,046
Why don't you wear my body?

853
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:11,764
But you guys serve Madara.
Are you sure about this?

854
01:04:12,606 --> 01:04:15,401
He's... a good boy.

855
01:04:16,125 --> 01:04:18,669
Don't you want to help
Rin and Kakashi?

856
01:04:23,133 --> 01:04:25,260
Thanks, you guys!

857
01:04:43,462 --> 01:04:49,051
You stayed connected to the statue and
borrowed its power? Nice.

858
01:04:52,591 --> 01:04:54,719
I'm pretty good, huh?

859
01:04:59,627 --> 01:05:00,628
All right!

860
01:05:02,290 --> 01:05:03,291
So you're going?

861
01:05:11,924 --> 01:05:14,798
I'm grateful that you saved me.

862
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:18,372
But I'm leaving. I have to go.

863
01:05:19,590 --> 01:05:21,676
You're being too hasty...

864
01:05:22,270 --> 01:05:24,940
It may be premature to thank me.

865
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:28,299
I'll probably never come back here.

866
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:30,343
I've given my thanks.

867
01:05:30,676 --> 01:05:31,761
I'm going!

868
01:05:33,225 --> 01:05:37,229
You... will return.

869
01:05:37,507 --> 01:05:40,927
And that's when I'll get
your true gratitude.

870
01:05:42,934 --> 01:05:46,001
White one!
What's Rin and Kakashi's location?!

871
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:48,262
Take me there right away!

872
01:05:48,683 --> 01:05:52,770
What you've got on your body
is like a clone of me.

873
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:57,828
And we can talk telepathically to
each other over limited distances.

874
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:01,540
Others of us are scattered
here and there underground.

875
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:03,709
We're able to exchange intel.

876
01:06:03,734 --> 01:06:06,111
I'll use them to guide you.

877
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:07,838
Swirly!

878
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:09,966
First, we need to get outside.

879
01:06:10,465 --> 01:06:11,466
I'm counting on you.

880
01:06:25,546 --> 01:06:27,589
How are Rin and Kakashi
doing right now?

881
01:06:28,289 --> 01:06:32,252
From what the others are saying,
it looks pretty bad.

882
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:37,231
They're talking about some Hidden Mist test
subjects, but I don't really understand.

883
01:06:38,089 --> 01:06:39,465
Test subjects?

884
01:06:40,693 --> 01:06:44,739
Anyway, it seems Rin and Kakashi
are totally surrounded.

885
01:06:45,066 --> 01:06:49,779
And they're saying they all appear
to be Jonin or Black Ops.

886
01:06:50,464 --> 01:06:52,341
What's Minato-sensei doing?

887
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:53,509
Who is that?

888
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:56,095
I'm asking you what the Yellow Flash
of the Leaf is doing!

889
01:06:58,414 --> 01:07:01,098
Seems he's on a different mission.

890
01:07:01,779 --> 01:07:03,155
At a time like this?!

891
01:07:04,145 --> 01:07:07,398
<i>Kakashi! You made me a promise!</i>

892
01:07:08,683 --> 01:07:09,726
<i>Please...</i>

893
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:13,701
<i>Please protect Rin somehow!</i>

894
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:17,408
<i>I'll be right there!</i>

895
01:07:18,112 --> 01:07:21,365
Obito, this will probably turn
into a battle.

896
01:07:21,390 --> 01:07:23,892
So I want to tell you
some things beforehand.

897
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:25,124
What is it?!

898
01:07:25,264 --> 01:07:28,017
Your fighting ability is lower
than mine.

899
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:31,439
Plus right now, it's like my big body
is wrapped around

900
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:35,843
and protecting
your wounded little body.

901
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:38,242
So what?!

902
01:07:38,267 --> 01:07:41,562
I think it would be better
if I do all the fighting.

903
01:07:42,808 --> 01:07:44,560
Remember what Madara said?

904
01:07:44,881 --> 01:07:48,981
That only with a pair together can the
Sharingan's true power be unleashed!

905
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:52,835
Kakashi, the other half of my pair,
will be on the battlefield.

906
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:56,155
Our combo attacks are superior!

907
01:07:56,673 --> 01:07:59,342
Kakashi and I will protect Rin!

908
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:06,166
As I recall, you do have
Hashirama's tissue attached to you.

909
01:08:06,368 --> 01:08:08,798
A whole different strength may emerge

910
01:08:08,823 --> 01:08:14,161
when Senju and Uchiha powers
are combined together, but...

911
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:18,886
What was that?

912
01:08:30,142 --> 01:08:32,186
I thought it was rain, but it's...

913
01:08:32,971 --> 01:08:35,473
I just got word from one of my guys.

914
01:08:35,498 --> 01:08:36,666
It seems...

915
01:08:37,988 --> 01:08:40,032
That's the location.

916
01:08:41,673 --> 01:08:42,674
Let's go!

917
01:08:55,545 --> 01:08:56,921
<i>What's happening?!</i>

918
01:08:57,049 --> 01:08:59,218
<i>Stop showing these weird images!</i>

919
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:01,595
<i>A little bit...</i>

920
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:03,848
<i>Just a little bit farther!</i>

921
01:09:19,224 --> 01:09:20,892
Kakashi...

922
01:10:01,328 --> 01:10:03,288
Damn it! He did it!

923
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:06,788
After all the trouble
we went through to get her!

924
01:10:11,613 --> 01:10:12,614
Rin...

925
01:10:29,298 --> 01:10:30,632
<i>Where...</i>

926
01:10:31,971 --> 01:10:33,973
<i>in the world...</i>

927
01:10:34,426 --> 01:10:35,845
<i>is this place?!</i>

928
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,310
Who is that guy?

929
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:40,503
Reinforcements maybe?

930
01:10:40,697 --> 01:10:42,740
What a fool, jumping in alone!

931
01:10:43,516 --> 01:10:44,684
<i>I won't accept it!</i>

932
01:10:49,795 --> 01:10:51,177
<i>I will not...</i>

933
01:10:51,673 --> 01:10:53,258
What just happened?!

934
01:10:53,716 --> 01:10:54,842
Did he dodge them?

935
01:10:55,664 --> 01:10:58,708
... accept any of this!

936
01:11:06,493 --> 01:11:08,870
Do not mock the Blood Mist Village!

937
01:11:22,213 --> 01:11:23,255
Die!

938
01:11:26,496 --> 01:11:27,539
I can't hit him!

939
01:11:36,333 --> 01:11:37,835
Who is that guy?!

940
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:39,486
He wields a strange jutsu!

941
01:11:40,212 --> 01:11:42,548
At least grab the girl!

942
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:44,842
Don't hand her corpse over
to the enemy!

943
01:11:53,934 --> 01:11:56,895
There's no mistake!
This guy passes right through you!

944
01:12:07,072 --> 01:12:08,449
<i>All of a sudden,</i>

945
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:10,326
<i>he's able to use
the Wood Style Cutting Sprigs Jutsu...</i>

946
01:12:10,351 --> 01:12:14,063
<i>Obito, now I understand
why Madara chose you!</i>

947
01:12:51,086 --> 01:12:53,547
What is he?

948
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:43,710
I get it...

949
01:13:45,629 --> 01:13:46,630
I'm...

950
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:53,679
I'm...

951
01:13:56,651 --> 01:13:58,361
in Hell.

952
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:08,652
<i>The longer you live...</i>

953
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:11,697
<i>the more you realize
that only pain, suffering,</i>

954
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:15,325
<i>and futility exist in this reality.</i>

955
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,161
<i>Listen to me...</i>

956
01:14:17,578 --> 01:14:19,371
<i>In this world,</i>

957
01:14:19,413 --> 01:14:23,292
<i>wherever there is light,
there are always shadows.</i>

958
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:25,669
<i>These are all nexuses,</i>

959
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,339
<i>causal relationships
that cannot be separated.</i>

960
01:14:28,589 --> 01:14:29,631
<i>Normally, that is.</i>

961
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:40,809
<i>He's talking about discarding all
the bad things in the real world</i>

962
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:44,688
<i>and escaping inside a dream
that's full of good things!</i>

963
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:10,881
<i>Since it's a dream,
everything is how you want it!</i>

964
01:15:13,805 --> 01:15:16,808
<i>Even those who are dead
can be alive again!</i>

965
01:15:20,387 --> 01:15:24,474
<i>A world of only victors...
a world of only peace...</i>

966
01:15:24,682 --> 01:15:26,392
<i>a world of only love.</i>

967
01:15:27,146 --> 01:15:29,940
<i>I will create such a world.</i>

968
01:15:33,111 --> 01:15:35,656
<i>Again, Rin...</i>

969
01:15:37,164 --> 01:15:40,250
<i>I'll create a world where
we can be together again.</i>

970
01:15:49,699 --> 01:15:53,411
<i>I shall sever the nexuses...</i>

971
01:15:56,134 --> 01:15:57,469
<i>of this world...</i>

972
01:16:01,581 --> 01:16:03,526
That's why I've come back.

973
01:16:09,606 --> 01:16:12,067
I hope no one saw you.

974
01:16:13,162 --> 01:16:15,445
I'm the only one who saw him.

975
01:16:16,001 --> 01:16:20,965
Obito slaughtered everyone,
so we're safe.

976
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:25,205
He didn't seem to want
to kill Kakashi though.

977
01:16:26,081 --> 01:16:28,709
But Kakashi didn't see anything.

978
01:16:29,459 --> 01:16:31,837
When reinforcements from
the Hidden Leaf arrived,

979
01:16:31,878 --> 01:16:34,631
he was screaming,
"Who killed the enemy?!"

980
01:16:36,067 --> 01:16:39,153
So you still felt loyalty to
your one-time teammate?

981
01:16:40,111 --> 01:16:43,240
No, it doesn't matter
to me anymore

982
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:48,687
whether he's alive or
dead in this world.

983
01:16:49,896 --> 01:16:52,608
Kakashi will exist
in the world we'll create.

984
01:16:54,067 --> 01:16:55,068
Rin too...

985
01:16:55,902 --> 01:17:00,073
Madara, teach me how to create
this world of dreams.

986
01:17:02,784 --> 01:17:04,202
I don't need
your thanks anymore.

987
01:17:04,911 --> 01:17:06,163
Come here.

988
01:17:07,098 --> 01:17:09,350
Starting today,
you will be the savior.

989
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:12,044
Look into my eye.

990
01:17:15,672 --> 01:17:18,050
You are inside my genjutsu.

991
01:17:19,144 --> 01:17:20,604
It's still a blank canvas,

992
01:17:20,761 --> 01:17:24,097
but I can project my will upon it
to create whatever I want.

993
01:17:25,098 --> 01:17:27,142
And even control them.

994
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:29,828
Anything is possible,

995
01:17:29,853 --> 01:17:33,524
since I'm linked to, and borrowing,
the power of the Gedo Statue.

996
01:17:35,109 --> 01:17:36,194
Like this, see?

997
01:17:38,862 --> 01:17:42,074
We'll use this genjutsu
to create the ideal world.

998
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:47,537
And then, we'll cast the genjutsu
on everyone and bring them here.

999
01:17:49,289 --> 01:17:51,583
The scale of this jutsu
is accomplished

1000
01:17:51,761 --> 01:17:54,222
by projecting it off the moon instead
of our eyes.

1001
01:17:54,247 --> 01:17:56,123
So that an entire world of dreams
is achieved.

1002
01:17:57,420 --> 01:18:00,882
You make it sound so simple,
but I still don't quite get it.

1003
01:18:02,098 --> 01:18:03,683
Let me explain,

1004
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:06,640
starting with the Sage of Six Paths
and Ten-Tails.

1005
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:10,310
Isn't the Ten-Tails just a legend?

1006
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:14,272
Legends are always derived
from something real.

1007
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:17,818
The Tailed Beasts
that roam the world...

1008
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:20,160
resulted when
the Sage of the Six Paths

1009
01:18:20,185 --> 01:18:21,604
split up the power
of the Ten-Tails.

1010
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:26,535
Do you have proof
that story is true?!

1011
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:28,036
I do.

1012
01:18:29,287 --> 01:18:31,998
After I obtained the cells
of Hashirama Senju,

1013
01:18:32,571 --> 01:18:35,198
I implanted them into my wound.

1014
01:18:35,585 --> 01:18:37,295
At that time, nothing happened...

1015
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:41,174
It was only when I was starting
to die of old age...

1016
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:44,261
that my Rinnegan awakened.

1017
01:18:45,606 --> 01:18:49,318
And it simultaneously led
to the undoing of a certain seal.

1018
01:18:51,184 --> 01:18:53,562
I was then able to summon,
and extract,

1019
01:18:53,603 --> 01:18:56,148
the husk of the Ten-Tails
from a Sealing Stone.

1020
01:18:56,606 --> 01:18:58,066
The Ten-Tails' husk?

1021
01:18:59,229 --> 01:19:01,481
I call it the Gedo Statue.

1022
01:19:01,796 --> 01:19:04,882
And the Seal Stone is
what we know as the moon.

1023
01:19:06,441 --> 01:19:10,236
Immediately, I used the statue's body
as a catalyst

1024
01:19:10,261 --> 01:19:13,264
to culture Hashirama's cells
into what you see before you.

1025
01:19:14,805 --> 01:19:18,851
One could say that these artificial beings
are clones of Hashirama.

1026
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:21,548
Although they are reduced in quality.

1027
01:19:23,069 --> 01:19:25,541
The Rinnegan cannot be awakened

1028
01:19:25,566 --> 01:19:28,694
without the possessing
both Uchiha and Senju powers.

1029
01:19:28,733 --> 01:19:31,236
And the statue cannot
be controlled easily.

1030
01:19:33,388 --> 01:19:36,558
You have Senju cells attached
to the right half of you.

1031
01:19:37,510 --> 01:19:39,387
Even if you never awaken
the Rinnegan,

1032
01:19:39,566 --> 01:19:42,486
you should be able to
eventually control the statue.

1033
01:19:49,242 --> 01:19:52,829
Did you see them?
That redhead's eyes?

1034
01:19:55,338 --> 01:19:56,923
So they're Madara's Rinnegan, huh...

1035
01:19:58,374 --> 01:20:00,501
They're Madara's actual eyes.

1036
01:20:01,168 --> 01:20:03,129
When that kid was younger...

1037
01:20:03,154 --> 01:20:06,282
he secretly transplanted them
without anyone noticing!

1038
01:20:07,283 --> 01:20:10,453
<i>Nagato is of Senju bloodline.</i>

1039
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:15,018
<i>And the only other person
in addition to Madara</i>

1040
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:18,146
<i>who can summon the Gedo Statue.</i>

1041
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:24,861
<i>As Madara said,
first, we win him over and...</i>

1042
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:28,031
Huh?! What are you going to do?

1043
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:30,575
I'm going straight for him.

1044
01:20:31,134 --> 01:20:34,262
H-Hey, shouldn't you plan
a strategy first?

1045
01:20:34,350 --> 01:20:35,810
I don't need to do that.

1046
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:37,833
<i>Obito...</i>

1047
01:20:38,792 --> 01:20:41,628
<i>I shall teach you the Uchiha
Forbidden Jutsu, the Six Paths Jutsu.</i>

1048
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:46,174
And the Yin and Yang Style Jutsu.

1049
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:54,647
I've implanted my will
inside this one...

1050
01:20:55,183 --> 01:20:56,852
Think of him as being half of me.

1051
01:20:57,936 --> 01:20:59,938
Though he'll be degraded too.

1052
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:02,566
You can use these beings
that I created

1053
01:21:02,607 --> 01:21:04,943
using Shadow and Light
Style Jutsu as your soldiers.

1054
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:14,619
That Black Rod was created
as a physical manifestation of my will.

1055
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:18,540
Use it when you perform
the Six Paths Jutsu...

1056
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:34,306
Now, go on...

1057
01:21:34,472 --> 01:21:38,435
Until the time when I will be revived...

1058
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:41,062
You shall be...

1059
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:45,901
Who are you?

1060
01:21:47,213 --> 01:21:48,714
I am Madara Uchiha.

1061
01:21:50,488 --> 01:21:54,576
You're either a criminal
or a total idiot

1062
01:21:54,618 --> 01:21:56,244
to claim Uchiha Madara's name.

1063
01:21:57,329 --> 01:22:00,040
Why'd you approach us?

1064
01:22:00,874 --> 01:22:01,875
The Rinnegan...

1065
01:22:03,973 --> 01:22:06,142
To guide those who awaken it,
is the mission

1066
01:22:06,167 --> 01:22:10,213
our organization has been
entrusted with since ages past.

1067
01:22:11,885 --> 01:22:13,678
You know about my eyes?

1068
01:22:15,096 --> 01:22:17,515
You are the reincarnation
of the Sage of Six Paths,

1069
01:22:17,557 --> 01:22:21,102
who dreamed of world peace
and stability.

1070
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:25,023
Only the villages of large nations
are showered in light.

1071
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:30,243
Leaving your small country's village
in the shadow, dying.

1072
01:22:30,483 --> 01:22:33,778
That is why your eye
has awakened here.

1073
01:22:35,492 --> 01:22:38,453
Wherever light strikes,
there are always shadows.

1074
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:41,164
So long as there is
a concept of victors...

1075
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:43,833
the vanquished will also similarly exist.

1076
01:22:44,668 --> 01:22:48,797
The selfish intent of wanting
to preserve peace initiates wars.

1077
01:22:48,838 --> 01:22:51,800
And hatred is born in order
to protect love.

1078
01:22:52,592 --> 01:22:56,596
These are all nexuses, causal
relationships that cannot be separated.

1079
01:22:57,222 --> 01:22:58,807
<i>Normally, that is.</i>

1080
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:04,854
But a world of just victors,
peace and love...

1081
01:23:05,271 --> 01:23:08,066
such a world can be created too.

1082
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:12,779
If you allow us to collaborate,
you can learn how.

1083
01:23:14,072 --> 01:23:17,575
As soon as you attain
the true power of the Rinnegan...

1084
01:23:17,617 --> 01:23:20,912
Your very own world can
be immediately actualized.

1085
01:23:21,871 --> 01:23:23,331
Now...

1086
01:23:24,207 --> 01:23:26,084
I can't do that.

1087
01:23:27,298 --> 01:23:29,126
You're just trying to use us.

1088
01:23:30,088 --> 01:23:32,757
Your offer sounds way
too convenient.

1089
01:23:35,403 --> 01:23:37,447
One can only reach
the true world

1090
01:23:37,472 --> 01:23:42,227
after knowing another's pain
and shedding tears alongside them.

1091
01:23:43,226 --> 01:23:45,311
Shedding tears alongside them, huh?

1092
01:23:45,603 --> 01:23:47,147
You mean in revenge?

1093
01:23:48,106 --> 01:23:50,400
No, that's not what I meant.

1094
01:23:50,817 --> 01:23:52,819
I meant in mutual understanding.

1095
01:23:53,278 --> 01:23:56,239
Stop talking so idealistically.

1096
01:23:56,531 --> 01:23:58,783
No such thing exists
in this world.

1097
01:23:59,951 --> 01:24:01,619
Let's go, Konan... Nagato.

1098
01:24:02,287 --> 01:24:03,955
We can't trust these guys!

1099
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:08,334
Don't you dare approach us again!

1100
01:24:14,174 --> 01:24:17,260
I'll wait here at
the same time every day.

1101
01:24:17,606 --> 01:24:21,276
You'll eventually realize it too.

1102
01:24:31,235 --> 01:24:32,694
We finally made it up to this point.

1103
01:24:33,693 --> 01:24:34,694
Nagato.

1104
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:37,121
You're—!

1105
01:24:37,822 --> 01:24:40,283
Reality is moving ahead quickly.

1106
01:24:41,284 --> 01:24:45,121
Cut your ties with Yahiko immediately
and join me.

1107
01:24:46,164 --> 01:24:48,083
Otherwise, you will all...

1108
01:24:48,176 --> 01:24:49,386
We will what?

1109
01:24:50,610 --> 01:24:53,613
What Yahiko speaks of
are just ideals.

1110
01:24:54,130 --> 01:24:59,260
He tries to understand others' pain... but
they do not even attempt to know our pain.

1111
01:25:00,125 --> 01:25:04,379
Furthermore, this world has
no desire for that either.

1112
01:25:04,502 --> 01:25:06,045
That is reality.

1113
01:25:07,382 --> 01:25:10,969
You possess the Rinnegan,
so you should understand.

1114
01:25:12,549 --> 01:25:14,133
No matter what you say,

1115
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:17,112
I believe in Yahiko's ideals!

1116
01:25:21,477 --> 01:25:25,230
I guess without pain...
you cannot experience reality.

1117
01:25:27,288 --> 01:25:30,250
In that respect, even though
you possess the Rinnegan,

1118
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:32,836
you still think like
an average person.

1119
01:25:35,171 --> 01:25:36,506
Very well...

1120
01:25:36,681 --> 01:25:41,311
Go see reality for yourself,
and experience pain.

1121
01:25:44,806 --> 01:25:46,349
There you are, Nagato.

1122
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:48,281
Yahiko...

1123
01:25:48,852 --> 01:25:49,936
Was someone just here?

1124
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:50,854
No...

1125
01:25:52,129 --> 01:25:53,630
Let's get going.

1126
01:25:54,287 --> 01:25:56,665
Or we'll be late for the meeting
with Lord Hanzo.

1127
01:25:57,349 --> 01:25:58,725
Right, let's go!

1128
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:04,406
Oww!

1129
01:26:04,687 --> 01:26:09,024
What's the big idea?
I was having a nice nap!

1130
01:26:10,785 --> 01:26:11,786
What?

1131
01:26:14,625 --> 01:26:17,044
Hey! Where'd Brothers Yahiko
and Nagato go?!

1132
01:26:18,648 --> 01:26:21,275
I think they left already.

1133
01:26:21,529 --> 01:26:22,906
The meeting with Hanzo is today.

1134
01:26:23,052 --> 01:26:26,472
Wake the guys up!
We have to catch up with them!

1135
01:26:26,562 --> 01:26:27,563
What's wrong?

1136
01:26:27,619 --> 01:26:29,037
I'll tell you later!

1137
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:33,146
What's going on anyway?

1138
01:26:33,771 --> 01:26:37,483
We just received word from a
member of the Hidden Leaf border team.

1139
01:26:37,820 --> 01:26:41,157
The Leaf's ANBU Black Ops are
on their way to Hanzo's as well.

1140
01:26:41,878 --> 01:26:43,629
The Leaf's ANBU?

1141
01:26:44,407 --> 01:26:46,242
Why are they going to Hanzo's?

1142
01:26:46,534 --> 01:26:48,077
I don't know the specifics.

1143
01:26:48,895 --> 01:26:51,064
But I just don't like the timing
of it all, you know?

1144
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:53,458
And when you think about it...

1145
01:26:53,621 --> 01:26:56,457
this thing with Hanzo just sounds
too good to be true.

1146
01:26:57,028 --> 01:27:00,490
Then that means...
today's meeting with Hanzo is...

1147
01:27:01,507 --> 01:27:04,594
Whatever it is,
we need to let Brothers know!

1148
01:27:08,264 --> 01:27:12,810
As much as I regret it,
I can't let you go any further.

1149
01:27:13,186 --> 01:27:14,187
Who are you?!

1150
01:27:14,735 --> 01:27:16,988
My name is Madara Uchiha...

1151
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:20,401
Damn you! Did Hanzo send you?

1152
01:27:22,195 --> 01:27:24,030
I don't work for Hanzo.

1153
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:28,284
But I can't let you interfere right now.

1154
01:27:29,097 --> 01:27:32,976
I want Nagato to see
what reality is.

1155
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:36,084
We don't have time for
your nonsense.

1156
01:27:36,292 --> 01:27:37,919
Kill them!

1157
01:27:38,711 --> 01:27:40,129
You take care of the weaklings.

1158
01:27:40,213 --> 01:27:43,841
You sure like to order me around!

1159
01:27:51,516 --> 01:27:56,813
I'm Kyusuke the Swift!
Don't underestimate my speed!

1160
01:28:11,995 --> 01:28:13,579
I slipped right through him?

1161
01:28:13,871 --> 01:28:14,998
What's going on?!

1162
01:28:17,792 --> 01:28:18,793
Kyusuke!

1163
01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:21,587
You bastards!

1164
01:28:22,255 --> 01:28:25,466
Why... are you... doing this?

1165
01:28:25,830 --> 01:28:29,918
I'm going to awaken Nagato's Rinnegan
in the truest sense possible.

1166
01:28:30,263 --> 01:28:31,514
What are you talking about?

1167
01:28:32,873 --> 01:28:37,002
There is no such thing as peace
in this accursed world.

1168
01:28:37,395 --> 01:28:41,899
Nagato must abandon this dream
and set out into a new world.

1169
01:28:41,983 --> 01:28:44,027
I'm not going to let you!

1170
01:28:46,154 --> 01:28:47,030
Daibutsu!

1171
01:28:47,071 --> 01:28:48,698
Now! Go right through me!

1172
01:28:51,056 --> 01:28:52,057
Hurry!

1173
01:28:53,077 --> 01:28:55,121
I'll see you in the next world!

1174
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:08,134
The Water Prison Jutsu?

1175
01:29:08,593 --> 01:29:11,179
You can't beat me with a jutsu like this!

1176
01:29:12,970 --> 01:29:14,972
<i>This is no ordinary Water Prison.</i>

1177
01:29:23,823 --> 01:29:25,950
<i>This is cement!</i>

1178
01:29:26,444 --> 01:29:30,016
For the first time in
my dismal life as a war orphan...

1179
01:29:30,292 --> 01:29:33,451
I found hope in the Akatsuki!

1180
01:29:33,908 --> 01:29:38,163
You think... I'd let some bastard
like you take that away?!

1181
01:29:40,013 --> 01:29:42,641
<i>He's sacrificing his life
in this attack...</i>

1182
01:29:42,835 --> 01:29:46,130
<i>But, as expected,
we're literally in different dimensions.</i>

1183
01:29:46,756 --> 01:29:47,965
<i>No way!</i>

1184
01:29:55,139 --> 01:29:56,224
Kyusuke...

1185
01:29:56,799 --> 01:29:58,259
Your death will not be...

1186
01:29:59,143 --> 01:30:00,853
Owww...

1187
01:30:01,008 --> 01:30:04,941
The surface hardened...
and I shed the layer, but it stings!

1188
01:30:09,445 --> 01:30:13,324
Sorry, but this is the end for all of you.

1189
01:30:26,754 --> 01:30:28,631
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1190
01:30:29,094 --> 01:30:30,053
Yeah.

1191
01:30:31,562 --> 01:30:33,272
Come, we have to hurry!

1192
01:30:34,053 --> 01:30:36,305
We have to witness Nagato's destiny!

1193
01:30:59,237 --> 01:31:00,238
Konan...

1194
01:31:03,779 --> 01:31:04,519
Yahi—

1195
01:31:13,134 --> 01:31:14,135
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

1196
01:31:14,297 --> 01:31:15,923
<i>Gedo Statue!</i>

1197
01:31:27,273 --> 01:31:28,274
There it is!

1198
01:31:28,299 --> 01:31:31,719
So he summoned it.
It's the Ten-Tails' husk...

1199
01:31:31,830 --> 01:31:33,457
What... is that?!

1200
01:31:34,071 --> 01:31:36,324
Nagato... No! Don't use that!

1201
01:32:01,265 --> 01:32:02,934
We're dead if that touches us!

1202
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:28,435
Nagato, Yahiko, Konan...

1203
01:32:29,147 --> 01:32:30,440
The world of dreams...

1204
01:32:31,286 --> 01:32:33,413
I shall let you see each other there...

1205
01:32:34,044 --> 01:32:35,171
without fail.

1206
01:32:51,566 --> 01:32:54,485
I'm sorry I haven't been by.

1207
01:32:55,861 --> 01:32:57,905
It's not that I've forgotten...

1208
01:33:00,098 --> 01:33:03,226
I've been... sworn to secrecy...

1209
01:33:04,161 --> 01:33:06,581
but Minato-sensei is going
to be a father.

1210
01:33:08,070 --> 01:33:10,239
This generation won't know war.

1211
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:13,713
If only we were born a little later...

1212
01:33:18,430 --> 01:33:20,265
I should tell Obito too.

1213
01:33:22,096 --> 01:33:24,140
So I'll be going, Rin.

1214
01:33:42,556 --> 01:33:43,849
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

1215
01:34:03,843 --> 01:34:04,970
<i>Minato-sensei...</i>

1216
01:34:07,266 --> 01:34:08,976
<i>All of this...</i>

1217
01:34:11,806 --> 01:34:13,099
<i>This world...</i>

1218
01:34:18,235 --> 01:34:20,245
- <i>None of it matters anymore!</i>
- None of it matters anymore!

1219
01:34:36,545 --> 01:34:38,297
I'm not going to let
that happen, idiot!

1220
01:34:38,923 --> 01:34:41,801
I'm the son of
the Fourth Hokage, you know!

1221
01:34:42,343 --> 01:34:44,804
I'm not going to fall for your talk!

1222
01:34:46,597 --> 01:34:47,390
I see.

1223
01:34:47,700 --> 01:34:51,313
I was going easy on you because you
were the actual Jinchuriki, not a clone.

1224
01:34:51,477 --> 01:34:53,813
But if that's how you feel,
I won't hold back on you!

1225
01:34:54,288 --> 01:34:57,945
This is Hashirama's Wood Dragon, which he
used to bind the Nine-Tails long ago.

1226
01:35:03,191 --> 01:35:05,714
Madara really is crazy powerful.

1227
01:35:07,168 --> 01:35:10,030
That's what makes him
worth fighting.

1228
01:35:12,353 --> 01:35:14,814
You're pretty good at acting tough.

1229
01:35:15,251 --> 01:35:17,712
I'm not going to hold back
against a zombie either!

1230
01:35:18,370 --> 01:35:19,663
Since you're already dead!

1231
01:35:43,304 --> 01:35:44,305
Why?!

1232
01:35:44,739 --> 01:35:46,449
Why ally yourself with someone
like Madara?

1233
01:35:49,869 --> 01:35:52,538
I've got nothing to say to you.

1234
01:35:53,247 --> 01:35:54,498
All that's left...

1235
01:35:56,198 --> 01:35:58,043
is this final battle!

1236
01:36:02,131 --> 01:36:03,794
<i>Earth Style: Mud Wall!</i>

1237
01:36:15,186 --> 01:36:16,187
Why?

1238
01:36:16,347 --> 01:36:18,390
How about shutting up already?

1239
01:36:18,856 --> 01:36:21,066
You're only talk.
You're nothing but a piece of trash.

1240
01:36:44,244 --> 01:36:47,873
<i>I believe that the White Fang
was a true hero.</i>

1241
01:36:49,036 --> 01:36:51,539
<i>Sure, in the world of ninja,</i>

1242
01:36:51,722 --> 01:36:54,016
<i>one who breaks
the rules and regulations</i>

1243
01:36:54,132 --> 01:36:55,425
<i>is regarded as trash.</i>

1244
01:36:56,185 --> 01:37:00,689
<i>But those who abandon
their comrades...</i>

1245
01:37:00,957 --> 01:37:02,459
<i>are worse than trash!</i>

1246
01:37:12,743 --> 01:37:14,453
<i>I am trash for sure...</i>

1247
01:37:16,694 --> 01:37:19,405
<i>But Obito, you've always...</i>

1248
01:37:20,428 --> 01:37:21,271
<i>Kamui...</i>

1249
01:37:22,306 --> 01:37:23,890
<i>... been my hero.</i>

1250
01:37:26,465 --> 01:37:27,466
<i>So why?</i>

1251
01:37:29,606 --> 01:37:31,358
Damn it!

1252
01:37:46,318 --> 01:37:47,736
That damned wooden thing!

1253
01:37:47,778 --> 01:37:49,572
It's absorbing
the Nine-Tails' chakra!

1254
01:38:01,458 --> 01:38:02,710
We have the same eyes...

1255
01:38:03,168 --> 01:38:04,712
So you made it out, huh?

1256
01:38:05,212 --> 01:38:07,756
Obito, how did you end up like this?

1257
01:38:27,902 --> 01:38:31,030
I said, trash should keep
their mouths shut!

1258
01:38:31,707 --> 01:38:32,708
Die.

1259
01:38:33,741 --> 01:38:37,328
I... couldn't keep
my promise to you.

1260
01:38:37,861 --> 01:38:41,323
You're right. I'm trash.

1261
01:38:43,398 --> 01:38:44,649
But you...

1262
01:38:45,294 --> 01:38:46,670
You're a hero of the Leaf.

1263
01:38:47,671 --> 01:38:49,715
There's no reason for you
to become trash too.

1264
01:39:04,396 --> 01:39:05,856
This is reality.

1265
01:39:06,471 --> 01:39:08,848
Those who leave things behind,
and those left behind... both.

1266
01:39:10,778 --> 01:39:14,531
All shinobi who survive
in this world become trash.

1267
01:39:14,865 --> 01:39:16,867
You and I are prime examples,

1268
01:39:17,368 --> 01:39:18,369
Kakashi.

1269
01:39:21,163 --> 01:39:25,626
No one can escape the cycle
that gives birth to trash in this world.

1270
01:39:25,876 --> 01:39:28,837
That's why I intend
to remake the world!

1271
01:39:30,339 --> 01:39:34,718
You guys make me so mad,
I can't even think straight.

1272
01:39:35,302 --> 01:39:38,430
So instead, let me tell you
something about myself.

1273
01:39:45,754 --> 01:39:47,839
I'm not trash!

1274
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:50,317
I'm not planning on
becoming trash either!

1275
01:39:51,986 --> 01:39:52,987
I will...

1276
01:39:54,071 --> 01:39:55,072
stop you!

1277
01:40:00,077 --> 01:40:03,539
- I'll never let my comrades die!
- I'll never let my comrades die!

1278
01:40:09,128 --> 01:40:12,256
<i>I'll never let my comrades die!</i>

1279
01:40:14,008 --> 01:40:15,342
<i>I'm sorry, Naruto.</i>

1280
01:40:16,301 --> 01:40:19,054
<i>I'm the one who taught you
Obito's words, and yet...</i>

1281
01:40:19,129 --> 01:40:20,611
<i>I was about to waver again.</i>

1282
01:40:31,120 --> 01:40:32,371
<i>Hirudora!</i>

1283
01:40:32,576 --> 01:40:33,577
<i>Lightning Blade!</i>

1284
01:40:40,075 --> 01:40:41,910
Guess it wasn't just a bluff.

1285
01:40:48,125 --> 01:40:49,126
Obito...

1286
01:40:49,918 --> 01:40:51,879
Your once strong will
is still alive today...

1287
01:40:52,072 --> 01:40:53,657
Right next to me!

1288
01:40:54,048 --> 01:40:58,135
What the current me can do
is protect the current Naruto!

1289
01:40:59,261 --> 01:41:01,346
You'll protect the current Naruto?

1290
01:41:02,651 --> 01:41:04,945
Same here...

1291
01:41:05,846 --> 01:41:07,546
<i>They're both at their limits!</i>

1292
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:10,931
<i>These Hidden Leaf guys
sure love to act tough!</i>

1293
01:41:19,490 --> 01:41:21,325
The wood's constriction
is weakening.

1294
01:41:27,462 --> 01:41:28,463
Octopops!

1295
01:41:29,714 --> 01:41:31,198
Ow oww!

1296
01:41:31,919 --> 01:41:33,112
Be careful, Naruto!

1297
01:41:33,629 --> 01:41:36,548
The enemy's Wood Style binding
is identical to the First Hokage's!

1298
01:41:36,965 --> 01:41:39,112
It has the power to
bind Tailed Beast Power!

1299
01:41:40,258 --> 01:41:42,010
Like Captain Yamato's technique...

1300
01:41:50,782 --> 01:41:52,742
A Lightning Blade that relies
on the Sharingan...

1301
01:41:53,273 --> 01:41:56,318
You've mastered your left eye...

1302
01:41:57,152 --> 01:41:58,362
Even awakening the Mangekyo.

1303
01:41:59,381 --> 01:42:03,427
But can you make it back
from the other dimension

1304
01:42:03,867 --> 01:42:04,994
in your current condition?

1305
01:42:16,703 --> 01:42:18,981
Go back to the trash heap, Kakashi!

1306
01:42:19,881 --> 01:42:21,466
Kakashi-sensei...

1307
01:42:24,221 --> 01:42:27,099
is just like... me!

1308
01:42:36,233 --> 01:42:38,694
Looks like we're going to have to
start worrying about Ten-Tails.

1309
01:42:39,111 --> 01:42:41,071
Let them handle Obito.

1310
01:42:43,574 --> 01:42:45,993
Then we'll make our move!

1311
01:42:50,832 --> 01:42:52,667
Now I see it clearly...

1312
01:43:02,594 --> 01:43:04,929
your pained face.

1313
01:43:08,682 --> 01:43:12,060
Save those lines for
the one right next to you.

1314
01:43:15,272 --> 01:43:18,483
<i>I definitely have to help
Kakashi-sensei somehow.</i>

1315
01:43:18,525 --> 01:43:21,195
<i>He's completely drained from
overusing the Sharingan.</i>

1316
01:43:21,532 --> 01:43:23,325
<i>If he gets sucked in...</i>

1317
01:43:25,078 --> 01:43:27,914
<i>Naruto, switch with me...</i>

1318
01:43:28,452 --> 01:43:29,119
Huh?

1319
01:43:29,453 --> 01:43:31,206
<i>Let me handle this.</i>

1320
01:43:31,580 --> 01:43:32,581
But...

1321
01:43:33,184 --> 01:43:34,936
<i>Don't argue. Just switch!</i>

1322
01:43:39,171 --> 01:43:41,607
<i>Hey, Kakashi, give me your hands.</i>

1323
01:43:42,261 --> 01:43:43,262
You're...

1324
01:43:43,926 --> 01:43:45,594
<i>Never mind that!
Just stick out your hands!</i>

1325
01:44:07,407 --> 01:44:10,077
Kurama! What the hell did you just do?

1326
01:44:10,377 --> 01:44:12,280
<i>Now you don't have any distractions.</i>

1327
01:44:12,558 --> 01:44:14,873
<i>I'm leaving the rest to you, Naruto.</i>

1328
01:44:15,562 --> 01:44:16,449
What?!

1329
01:44:20,587 --> 01:44:21,588
Damn!

1330
01:44:33,016 --> 01:44:36,395
Now that we know how
your ability works, I can counter it.

1331
01:44:37,421 --> 01:44:38,841
Here's another!

1332
01:44:45,333 --> 01:44:48,336
Oh yeah, that certainly
is a pained face Obito.

1333
01:44:50,033 --> 01:44:51,034
What's going on?

1334
01:44:54,032 --> 01:44:55,951
<i>Kakashi did that from the other side.</i>

1335
01:44:56,415 --> 01:44:58,250
<i>The difference between
you and me is...</i>

1336
01:44:58,829 --> 01:45:01,915
<i>I can give or take chakra at will.</i>

1337
01:45:02,421 --> 01:45:05,465
<i>I'll show you how it's done later.</i>

1338
01:45:06,466 --> 01:45:07,968
When did you pass it to him?

1339
01:45:08,130 --> 01:45:11,133
<i>When I grabbed his hand
to throw him.</i>

1340
01:45:14,128 --> 01:45:14,833
So then...!

1341
01:45:14,944 --> 01:45:19,187
<i>Yeah, whenever he wants to,
he can use Kamui to come out.</i>

1342
01:45:20,570 --> 01:45:21,571
Kakashi-sensei!

1343
01:45:22,094 --> 01:45:24,013
Thank Nine-Tails for me.

1344
01:45:24,901 --> 01:45:25,902
Sure!

1345
01:45:54,825 --> 01:45:57,244
Let's blast him to bits
before he revives!

1346
01:45:57,495 --> 01:45:58,663
Put in everything you've got!

1347
01:45:59,102 --> 01:46:00,103
Right!

1348
01:46:04,816 --> 01:46:07,903
It's ready to go,
Octopops and Eight-Tails!

1349
01:46:08,070 --> 01:46:08,862
Okay!

1350
01:46:09,071 --> 01:46:10,072
Fire!

1351
01:46:10,197 --> 01:46:12,532
It's over now!

1352
01:47:14,678 --> 01:47:17,347
The Statue's chakra... is gone.

1353
01:47:19,071 --> 01:47:19,989
We did it.

1354
01:47:20,030 --> 01:47:23,075
We did it, fool! Ya fool!

1355
01:47:23,353 --> 01:47:25,230
All right then!

1356
01:47:26,168 --> 01:47:27,613
It's over?

1357
01:47:31,824 --> 01:47:34,702
Yeah... for this world.

1358
01:47:42,893 --> 01:47:44,124
Now then...

1359
01:47:46,251 --> 01:47:47,711
Shall we get started?
