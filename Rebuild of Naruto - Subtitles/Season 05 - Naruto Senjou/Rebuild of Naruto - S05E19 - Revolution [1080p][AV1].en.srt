1
00:00:03,702 --> 00:00:05,295
Six Paths Gramps?

2
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:08,225
Are you by any chance
the legendary...?

3
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:11,387
<i>I am Hagoromo Otsutsuki.</i>

4
00:00:11,828 --> 00:00:15,122
<i>Also known as
the Sage of the Six Paths.</i>

5
00:00:16,148 --> 00:00:18,609
No wonder... you're levitating.

6
00:00:19,076 --> 00:00:22,152
At this point,
nothing shocks me anymore.

7
00:00:23,114 --> 00:00:26,576
It seems like everything
went well.

8
00:00:27,126 --> 00:00:31,290
The shinobi world sure became
a mess while we were dead.

9
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,283
Damn it!

10
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:37,326
It's the first time I've seen so many
Tailed Beasts together in one place!

11
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,706
The Sage of the Six Paths, eh...

12
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:43,293
It feels like we've wandered
into a fairy tale!

13
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,545
So you are the one, after all.

14
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:49,257
Summoning the past
Five Kage here and...

15
00:00:49,548 --> 00:00:52,777
being able to bring the Tailed Beasts
and us back from the other dimensions...

16
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:58,233
You're probably the only person
who could perform such godly actions.

17
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,102
<i>Are you Kakashi Hatake?</i>

18
00:01:01,244 --> 00:01:02,819
Oh... yes.

19
00:01:03,364 --> 00:01:07,942
<i>Good job guiding everyone and
sealing my mother away.</i>

20
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,987
<i>That truly was the work of gods.</i>

21
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,197
Oh, no.

22
00:01:12,563 --> 00:01:14,857
I hardly played any part at all.

23
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:19,579
It was these three
and many comrades.

24
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:27,462
And... a former friend also
lent me strength.

25
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:32,758
<i>That's why I said you
guided everyone well.</i>

26
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:35,278
<i>Despite losing your way,</i>

27
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:38,731
<i>you remained Naruto's teacher
and Obito's friend.</i>

28
00:01:39,832 --> 00:01:43,409
<i>Or else, you likely wouldn't have
succeeded in stopping my mother.</i>

29
00:01:47,515 --> 00:01:50,193
Hey! Kurama!

30
00:01:50,669 --> 00:01:53,446
Were you lonely being
separated from me?

31
00:01:53,872 --> 00:01:55,424
I missed you!

32
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,300
<i>Don't talk so loud!</i>

33
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,734
<i>I wasn't lonely.</i>

34
00:01:58,876 --> 00:02:01,438
<i>You have half of me
inside you... remember?</i>

35
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:08,386
<i>Just look at Kurama,
all embarrassed and flustered!</i>

36
00:02:08,903 --> 00:02:12,531
<i>But this is exactly
what I had once envisioned.</i>

37
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,433
That there would one day
be a shinobi,

38
00:02:17,044 --> 00:02:20,214
<i>who could move even
the Tailed Beasts to cooperate.</i>

39
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,894
Even Obito was Naruto's doing...

40
00:02:26,245 --> 00:02:28,413
He restored Obito.

41
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,192
<i>I see...</i>

42
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:36,197
<i>Then I shall ask Obito to tell me
that tale in the afterlife.</i>

43
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,077
<i>Is he still...?</i>

44
00:02:50,052 --> 00:02:51,303
I'm going to get going soon.

45
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:53,840
Yeah...

46
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:59,211
I really made a mess out
of the shinobi world.

47
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:04,517
So much that I don't even know
what to say to you before I go.

48
00:03:10,405 --> 00:03:14,076
We're able to say goodbye
as friends, not enemies.

49
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:16,287
To the old you...

50
00:03:16,411 --> 00:03:18,856
the one who was always late
because you were helping others.

51
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,993
That's plenty enough for me.

52
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,186
Thanks, Kakashi.

53
00:03:38,993 --> 00:03:41,871
I'll be going then.

54
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,924
I've been keeping Rin waiting.

55
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,023
Do you have an excuse ready?

56
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:58,238
I told her beforehand
I'd be helping you.

57
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,783
I see...

58
00:04:09,323 --> 00:04:10,782
<i>Same here...</i>

59
00:04:13,685 --> 00:04:16,271
<i>Thank you, Obito.</i>

60
00:04:23,338 --> 00:04:24,589
Kakashi-sensei!

61
00:04:26,097 --> 00:04:28,183
Sakura... Thank you.

62
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,229
Kakashi-sensei, your eyes!

63
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,855
Yeah...

64
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:37,193
As of today, Kakashi of
the Sharingan is no more.

65
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:56,546
<i>Madara was a Jinchuriki.
Even if it was temporary...</i>

66
00:04:56,629 --> 00:05:00,466
<i>emptied of the Tailed Beast,
he won't last long.</i>

67
00:05:00,632 --> 00:05:03,176
It's his fault for trying
to use such things.

68
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:07,086
<i>Sasuke, Naruto...</i>

69
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,553
<i>Behold, the end of
your predecessors.</i>

70
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,729
<i>You should watch this closely.</i>

71
00:05:18,033 --> 00:05:20,710
Is that you, Hashirama?

72
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:38,137
I guess neither you nor
I could achieve what we wanted.

73
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,882
It's never that easy!

74
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:45,269
Our job is to do all that we can,
while we're alive.

75
00:05:46,336 --> 00:05:51,717
And then, bequeath the rest for
future generations to accomplish.

76
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,771
So naïve...

77
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,774
as usual.

78
00:06:00,968 --> 00:06:06,515
You... were always... the optimist.

79
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,178
But perhaps...

80
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:15,500
that is the correct path.

81
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,304
My dream...

82
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,965
was squashed.

83
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:27,178
But your dream...

84
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,933
still lives on.

85
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,925
We were both too hasty.

86
00:06:35,178 --> 00:06:37,605
We didn't need to fulfill
our dreams ourselves.

87
00:06:38,764 --> 00:06:41,589
It was more important to cultivate
those who would come after us...

88
00:06:41,614 --> 00:06:44,325
to whom we could entrust
our dreams.

89
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:49,951
Which means I would
have failed anyway.

90
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:56,633
Since I always hated someone...
standing behind me...

91
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,588
When we were kids...

92
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,839
You once said we're shinobi

93
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,427
and we don't know
when we'll die.

94
00:07:08,286 --> 00:07:10,830
And that for neither side to die,

95
00:07:11,272 --> 00:07:13,933
we'd both have to reveal
what's inside of us

96
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:17,437
and pour each other drinks
to toast like brothers.

97
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,108
But we're both about to die.

98
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:27,697
Right now, we can drink together,
as war buddies.

99
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,746
War buddies... huh?

100
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,267
Well...

101
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:45,965
I guess... that's fine...

102
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,926
then...

103
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,195
<i>This is the perfect moment.</i>

104
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:06,445
<i>I will release the jutsu,
free the Five Kages</i>

105
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,514
<i>and those under the Reanimation.</i>

106
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,831
<i>Go.</i>

107
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,593
Dad...

108
00:08:31,852 --> 00:08:32,978
Oh, that's right.

109
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,348
I've been meaning to tell you...

110
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,916
Happy birthday!

111
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,838
You've become
a splendid young man, Naruto

112
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:14,244
Yeah... Thank you.

113
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,848
We're an existence outside
the rules.

114
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,435
We can't remain
in this world forever.

115
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,480
It's time to say goodbye.

116
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:39,912
I promise to tell
Kushina everything.

117
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:57,722
Tell her not to worry.
I'm eating properly!

118
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,808
I'm not picky and eat
lots of different stuff!

119
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:04,937
Like, tonkotsu ramen,
miso ramen, and shoyu ramen...

120
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,898
Oh but, not just ramen though!

121
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,603
I try to bathe every day!

122
00:10:11,628 --> 00:10:13,421
I go to the Leaf Hot Springs
once in a while too!

123
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,365
Although everyone just says
I only take quick dips...

124
00:10:18,425 --> 00:10:20,635
What else, what else...

125
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:22,771
I've made lots of friends!

126
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,874
And they're all good guys!

127
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:25,900
And...

128
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:31,881
I was really awful at school,
but I never got depressed and

129
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:35,009
had more confidence
than anyone else!

130
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,303
Naturally, I always obeyed

131
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:40,097
Lord Third and Kakashi-sensei.

132
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,807
I respect them both!

133
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:45,102
They're right here,
so you can ask them yourself!

134
00:10:45,387 --> 00:10:48,606
Oh! And those
Three Prohibitions of Shinobi?

135
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:52,109
I learned a lot about that
when I was with Pervy Sage!

136
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,820
He was hopeless
when it came to them though...

137
00:10:54,845 --> 00:10:57,498
but he was an awesome Sannin

138
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,207
and I respect him the most!

139
00:11:01,177 --> 00:11:04,705
I just turned 17 today,

140
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:07,106
so I don't know much
about alcohol or girls...

141
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:12,295
I know Mom said to find
someone like her...

142
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:17,351
But... that's... um...

143
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:20,947
Anyway!

144
00:11:21,071 --> 00:11:24,250
Not everything
Mom told me about went well,

145
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,310
but I'm doing the best I can!

146
00:11:26,535 --> 00:11:28,287
I've got dreams too!

147
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:31,649
I'm going to become an even
greater Hokage than you, Dad!

148
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,109
I swear I will!

149
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,328
So when you see Mom over there,
please tell her...

150
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:48,106
that she doesn't have to
worry about me at all!

151
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:51,644
Tell her I'm doin' my best!

152
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:54,797
<i>Got it...</i>

153
00:11:55,847 --> 00:11:57,849
<i>I'll make sure
to tell her everything.</i>

154
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:36,297
We're leaving the rest to you...
Kakashi, Sakura...

155
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,341
<i>Sasuke and Naruto.</i>

156
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:42,670
Lord Third!

157
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:47,224
Elder Brother, you finally
settled things with Madara.

158
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,210
As Saru said...

159
00:12:49,385 --> 00:12:52,054
<i>let's leave the rest
to the next generation.</i>

160
00:13:01,037 --> 00:13:02,539
<i>Naruto Uzumaki...</i>

161
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,343
<i>Sasuke Uchiha...</i>

162
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:11,732
<i>You two will probably find
a different conclusion than we did.</i>

163
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,627
<i>No... make sure you do.</i>

164
00:13:32,035 --> 00:13:34,454
<i>Now, we're free too!</i>

165
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,641
<i>I'm going back to Suirendo!</i>

166
00:13:39,368 --> 00:13:42,287
<i>I'm going to seclude myself in a forest.</i>

167
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:45,950
<i>We can finally go back to our homes.</i>

168
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:49,245
<i>It's like a dream.</i>

169
00:13:49,712 --> 00:13:52,798
<i>Eight-Tails, what are you going to do?</i>

170
00:13:52,897 --> 00:13:56,276
<i>Me? Well...</i>

171
00:13:59,997 --> 00:14:03,209
<i>I think I'm going to go back to Bee.</i>

172
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:07,755
<i>Even his annoying rap
has actually grown on me.</i>

173
00:14:08,455 --> 00:14:10,290
<i>So, what about you?</i>

174
00:14:12,576 --> 00:14:14,119
<i>What will you do?</i>

175
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,357
<i>I'll...</i>

176
00:14:21,711 --> 00:14:24,262
<i>A little piece of each of your chakra...</i>

177
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:28,241
<i>is already within Naruto.</i>

178
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:32,963
<i>In short, Naruto is like
a gathering place for you.</i>

179
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,457
<i>If you want to discuss something,</i>

180
00:14:35,482 --> 00:14:38,777
<i>you can speak to each other through
your chakra inside Naruto.</i>

181
00:14:39,185 --> 00:14:40,020
<i>Kurama...</i>

182
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,080
<i>Hmm?</i>

183
00:14:42,097 --> 00:14:46,726
<i>I'd like you to stay inside Naruto as
the overseer of the gathering place.</i>

184
00:14:47,737 --> 00:14:50,114
<i>It's no longer a hardship
for you anymore, is it?</i>

185
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:55,086
<i>Well, if you say so, old man,
I guess have no choice.</i>

186
00:14:58,005 --> 00:15:00,133
<i>What?!
What's so funny?</i>

187
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,928
<i>Still not upfront with your feelings...
You haven't changed at all, Kurama.</i>

188
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:11,368
So the Great Ninja War
is finally over now.

189
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:14,105
Yes. All that's left is...

190
00:15:14,979 --> 00:15:19,526
<i>Naruto and Sasuke...
I asked you before.</i>

191
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,669
<i>After battling my mother Kaguya,</i>

192
00:15:23,038 --> 00:15:26,166
<i>is there any change to
the answers you gave me?</i>

193
00:15:29,469 --> 00:15:31,221
My answer's the same.

194
00:15:31,587 --> 00:15:34,298
And I'm sorry, Gramps,

195
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:37,752
but there is one thing I feel
strongly about after fighting Kaguya...

196
00:15:38,603 --> 00:15:43,066
I'm really glad that
Kushina Uzumaki was my mom.

197
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,903
Kaguya was different from
anyone I've ever battled.

198
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,816
It's like she didn't have a heart at all.

199
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:56,630
<i>It's said my mother Kaguya started off
as a beloved goddess of the people.</i>

200
00:15:57,598 --> 00:16:00,351
<i>I do not know for sure what
caused her to transform</i>

201
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,161
<i>into a being that came to
be called a demon.</i>

202
00:16:02,585 --> 00:16:05,781
<i>I suspect something was triggered</i>

203
00:16:05,806 --> 00:16:08,358
<i>the moment she devoured
the Chakra Fruit.</i>

204
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,554
<i>In any case,
you are not like my mother.</i>

205
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,891
<i>I trust you not to become like her,</i>

206
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,736
<i>even with all the Tailed Beast
chakra within you.</i>

207
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,521
<i>Now then, all that's left is...</i>

208
00:16:21,638 --> 00:16:25,016
<i>to undo the Infinite Tsukuyomi.</i>

209
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:30,122
<i>But how, specifically?
Do you need our powers?</i>

210
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,490
<i>No, you're fine.</i>

211
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,911
<i>Naruto has the chakra
of every Tailed Beast.</i>

212
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,497
<i>And Sasuke possesses the Rinnegan.</i>

213
00:16:38,522 --> 00:16:41,525
<i>If they both weave
the sign for rat simultaneously,</i>

214
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,677
<i>the jutsu will be undone.</i>

215
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:47,005
<i>What? That's it? It's so simple.</i>

216
00:16:47,263 --> 00:16:52,560
<i>I researched thoroughly how to
undo Mother's Infinite Tsukuyomi.</i>

217
00:16:52,937 --> 00:16:54,355
<i>There's no mistake.</i>

218
00:16:55,096 --> 00:16:59,100
<i>Now then,
the rest is up to you, Sasuke.</i>

219
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:01,770
Yes...

220
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:08,644
But first, I'm going to execute the current
Five Kage who are trapped in the Infinite Tsukuyomi.

221
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:15,200
What did you just say, Sasuke?

222
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,662
What about the Five Kage?

223
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,331
Oh, and...

224
00:17:21,824 --> 00:17:24,852
I'm putting all of you Tailed Beasts
under my control...

225
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,795
and eventually,
I'll get rid of you as well.

226
00:17:26,895 --> 00:17:28,689
<i>What did you say?!</i>

227
00:17:42,585 --> 00:17:43,586
Kurama!

228
00:17:44,446 --> 00:17:47,241
<i>He put the Tailed Beasts
in a genjutsu...</i>

229
00:17:47,557 --> 00:17:49,476
<i>and with a single glance too.</i>

230
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:52,680
<i>Naruto, it has ended up
as I expected.</i>

231
00:17:53,671 --> 00:17:56,382
<i>I have no choice
but to leave the rest to you.</i>

232
00:17:57,158 --> 00:17:59,452
<i>I cannot stay in
this world any longer.</i>

233
00:17:59,894 --> 00:18:01,562
<i>I shall soon fade away.</i>

234
00:18:01,587 --> 00:18:06,300
Yeah, and sorry for saying this,
Six Paths Gramps...

235
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:09,588
but we won't end up like your sons.

236
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:11,755
I'm not Ashura.

237
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,427
And Sasuke isn't Indra either.

238
00:18:15,619 --> 00:18:18,956
Sasuke!
Is this what your current dream is?

239
00:18:19,514 --> 00:18:22,267
Are you saying you're
still seeking vengeance?

240
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:23,910
Sasuke!

241
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,106
I admit, at one time,
all I wished for was destruction,

242
00:18:28,131 --> 00:18:30,091
and vengeance was my goal.

243
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:31,951
But I feel differently now.

244
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:36,064
I want to destroy, and rebuild.

245
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,740
A village no longer
shrouded in darkness.

246
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,240
I'll reform the shinobi world.

247
00:18:44,455 --> 00:18:47,290
What I am proposing is...

248
00:18:49,627 --> 00:18:51,045
revolution!

249
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,757
Revolution?!

250
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:59,688
<i>My dear Sasuke,
what do you want to do?</i>

251
00:19:00,322 --> 00:19:03,031
<i>What is it that you seek
in the aftermath of this war?</i>

252
00:19:04,075 --> 00:19:07,286
<i>I want to hear your honest thoughts
and opinions.</i>

253
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:13,243
<i>All the previous Kage created
these current circumstances.</i>

254
00:19:13,702 --> 00:19:17,365
<i>So I will become Hokage
and change the village.</i>

255
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:24,463
<i>This Hokage you speak of...
What do you mean by it?</i>

256
00:19:25,214 --> 00:19:28,092
<i>If you want to know so badly,
I'll tell you.</i>

257
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,178
<i>Planetary Devastation!</i>

258
00:19:54,617 --> 00:19:57,245
<i>Naruto...
It's on you!</i>

259
00:19:58,547 --> 00:20:00,941
I swear I'll get you all out!

260
00:20:07,288 --> 00:20:09,649
Just hang in there
a little while longer!

261
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,553
Because of this war,

262
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:25,116
I've become quite adept at
using my Rinnegan's abilities.

263
00:20:25,732 --> 00:20:28,093
And all those who were
in my way are gone.

264
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,807
Except for you...

265
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,134
Naruto.

266
00:20:38,178 --> 00:20:40,222
<i>Things just don't go as planned.</i>

267
00:20:40,931 --> 00:20:43,767
<i>When I bequeathed power
to just one side,</i>

268
00:20:43,917 --> 00:20:46,086
<i>I ended up with Indra and Ashura.</i>

269
00:20:46,444 --> 00:20:50,990
<i>This time, even after entrusting power
to both, the result is the same.</i>

270
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:01,723
Nope... All sibling squabbling
ends right here!

271
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,770
Let the Tailed Beasts go.
They've finally gained freedom.

272
00:21:12,328 --> 00:21:14,580
They won't cause trouble anymore.

273
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:18,527
Naruto, you don't seem to get it.

274
00:21:20,103 --> 00:21:23,439
You're now the Jinchuriki
of all the Tailed Beasts.

275
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,452
Which means I plan to
eventually get rid of

276
00:21:27,477 --> 00:21:29,812
the Tailed Beast chakra
inside of you too.

277
00:21:30,755 --> 00:21:31,798
What?!

278
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:36,169
In other words,
you're going to die, Naruto.

279
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,630
Out of necessity.

280
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:45,370
If what the Sage said was true,
there's no need to use

281
00:21:45,495 --> 00:21:49,373
the Tailed Beast power inside you
to release the Infinite Tsukuyomi.

282
00:21:49,991 --> 00:21:52,829
I can take advantage of
the Tailed Beasts that I captured.

283
00:21:53,328 --> 00:21:55,831
I'll let them live until then.

284
00:21:56,172 --> 00:21:59,359
You know that I won't
let you do that, right?

285
00:22:02,128 --> 00:22:05,506
I guess I'll have to
deal with you first, Naruto.

286
00:22:08,601 --> 00:22:12,254
Let's move this elsewhere.
You know, don't you?

287
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,101
Wait, Sasuke!

288
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,713
Sensei!

289
00:22:21,164 --> 00:22:23,400
<i>The recoil of the Sharingan...</i>

290
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:39,549
I...

291
00:22:39,841 --> 00:22:43,636
I know in my heart that
there's nothing I can do!

292
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,681
Even though I love you.

293
00:22:45,706 --> 00:22:48,167
Even though I care about you
so much, Sasuke. And yet...

294
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,870
I can't get close to you
or exchange blows with you.

295
00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:54,932
I can only whine and beg
and cry like this again.

296
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,783
It's so pitiful, isn't it?

297
00:23:01,788 --> 00:23:02,713
<i>Sakura...</i>

298
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:05,925
<i>Thank you.</i>

299
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:10,871
But... But Sasuke!

300
00:23:10,896 --> 00:23:15,817
If there's even a little corner of
your heart that thinks about me,

301
00:23:15,842 --> 00:23:18,928
please don't leave again!

302
00:23:19,255 --> 00:23:23,177
If we stick together,
I know it can be like old times again...

303
00:23:26,129 --> 00:23:27,756
You're...

304
00:23:28,498 --> 00:23:30,208
... really annoying.

305
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:40,443
Sakura!

306
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,881
You didn't need to put Sakura
under genjutsu!

307
00:23:43,906 --> 00:23:45,057
If I didn't,

308
00:23:45,407 --> 00:23:48,910
she would've chased after us,
and gotten in the way.

309
00:23:49,552 --> 00:23:54,349
Sakura... Sakura just wanted
to help you, all this time.

310
00:23:54,732 --> 00:23:57,151
So you're suggesting I should play at romance?

311
00:23:57,618 --> 00:24:01,548
Well, I have no reason to love her
or be loved by her.

312
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:05,960
The only time you need a reason
is when you hate someone!

313
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:10,031
And Sakura's not trying to
make you hers!

314
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,200
She just wants to help you!

315
00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:15,421
She almost died by your hand.

316
00:24:15,828 --> 00:24:19,124
But she still thinks of your welfare
and sheds tears for you...

317
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,869
because she suffers from loving you!

318
00:24:22,643 --> 00:24:26,773
Perhaps, those are the ties
to a failed past.

319
00:24:30,477 --> 00:24:31,491
<i>Sasuke!</i>

320
00:24:32,712 --> 00:24:34,256
I made a promise.

321
00:24:35,457 --> 00:24:37,918
Long ago... to Sakura.

322
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:42,105
<i>I'll definitely bring Sasuke back!</i>

323
00:24:42,555 --> 00:24:45,100
<i>I swear on my life!</i>

324
00:24:45,424 --> 00:24:48,761
Sensei! You know about
my ninja way, right?

325
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,505
I'm going to go.

326
00:24:52,649 --> 00:24:55,235
Yeah... We're counting on you.

327
00:26:35,977 --> 00:26:38,938
<i>Love is a difficult thing...</i>

328
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:41,767
<i>I once had two sons.</i>

329
00:26:42,592 --> 00:26:45,971
<i>I loved them both,
and they loved and revered me.</i>

330
00:26:46,953 --> 00:26:50,330
<i>But I entrusted everything
to the younger brother.</i>

331
00:26:50,517 --> 00:26:51,701
<i>That became the impetus</i>

332
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:55,088
<i>for the older brother to begin
hating his brother and me.</i>

333
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,908
<i>Love transformed into hate.</i>

334
00:27:00,002 --> 00:27:02,591
<i>What molded the current Sasuke,</i>

335
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:06,633
<i>is none other than
his loss of love in the past.</i>

336
00:27:07,241 --> 00:27:09,160
<i>Madara was the same too.</i>

337
00:27:10,286 --> 00:27:15,166
Are you saying that Sasuke shares
the same fate as Madara?

338
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,268
<i>No, not at all.</i>

339
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:21,940
<i>I, too, want to make the future
better in my own way.</i>

340
00:27:22,382 --> 00:27:28,930
<i>Having learned from past mistakes,
this time I gave both of them the power.</i>

341
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,256
<i>The past does not exist</i>

342
00:27:31,281 --> 00:27:34,284
<i>to remind the present that
the future cannot change.</i>

343
00:27:34,411 --> 00:27:36,580
<i>The past is supposed to exist
for the sake of the future.</i>

344
00:27:37,214 --> 00:27:40,116
How did you see the potential
within Naruto?

345
00:27:40,308 --> 00:27:42,200
<i>Naruto Uzumaki...</i>

346
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:49,042
<i>The boy was able to save
and befriend Kurama,</i>

347
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:51,178
<i>who had become
a concretion of hatred.</i>

348
00:27:51,877 --> 00:27:54,088
<i>I shall let Naruto handle this.</i>

349
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:59,093
<i>Since I hope that hate can be
transformed into love this time.</i>

350
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:03,673
<i>Or rather, I have hope that
love can be regained.</i>

351
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:13,149
<i>Because, unlike my mother,
Naruto as well as Sasuke...</i>

352
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:16,236
<i>know what love is.</i>

353
00:28:16,719 --> 00:28:18,930
This place, huh?
I should've figured.

354
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:21,181
Doesn't it bring back memories,
Sasuke?

355
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:26,079
Long ago, we fought here.

356
00:28:26,946 --> 00:28:31,951
And just like before,
you're going to lose.

357
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:35,121
You won't be hitting me with
that same punch as last time!

358
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:39,009
I'm not about to let you get away
with whatever you want.

359
00:28:40,809 --> 00:28:43,938
I won't let you become
the Hokage, either!

360
00:28:44,731 --> 00:28:47,767
You don't even understand
what it means to be Hokage!

361
00:28:48,726 --> 00:28:51,187
I told you, that to me,
being Hokage means revolution.

362
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:55,692
It's totally different from what you think.

363
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:59,287
Let me tell you something
your big brother said...

364
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:03,900
It's not the one who becomes Hokage
who gets acknowledged by everyone.

365
00:29:04,467 --> 00:29:07,896
It is the one acknowledged by
everyone who becomes Hokage.

366
00:29:08,721 --> 00:29:13,469
I learned not from Itachi's words,
but from the way he lived his life.

367
00:29:15,052 --> 00:29:17,805
You and I came up
with different answers.

368
00:29:18,347 --> 00:29:20,498
Let me clarify this
before we battle...

369
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:26,055
I'll teach you exactly what being
Hokage means to me.

370
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,038
My explanation of
what it means to be Hokage

371
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,998
represents my response.

372
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,960
The way Itachi lived
led me to this answer.

373
00:29:56,461 --> 00:30:00,465
To protect the Land of Fire
and the Leaf Village,

374
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:03,301
he sacrificed both
his clan and himself.

375
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,012
First, I needed to know why.

376
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:10,024
What is this Land and Village
that he would go so far to protect?

377
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,311
The previous Hokage said...

378
00:30:14,128 --> 00:30:16,823
... that the village is a framework

379
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:20,151
created to stop the slaughter
of clans and children...

380
00:30:21,042 --> 00:30:23,044
... a framework that was
supposed to lead to peace.

381
00:30:23,912 --> 00:30:27,499
Itachi tried to sustain
that peace all by himself.

382
00:30:28,276 --> 00:30:30,370
That's when I finally understood...

383
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,456
Suffering bitter experiences,
living in darkness

384
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:37,085
as a criminal and traitor
against Land and Village...

385
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:39,871
He was a shinobi
who took on all hatred

386
00:30:40,146 --> 00:30:42,732
and protected the Land of Fire and
the Leaf Village from the shadows.

387
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:46,177
I feel he was the true Hokage.

388
00:30:50,981 --> 00:30:53,233
It's not the one who is
acknowledged by all...

389
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:56,271
... but the one who
accepts all the hatred

390
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,897
that is worthy of that title.

391
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:02,160
I eventually came to understand
Itachi's feelings

392
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,737
for his Land and Village.

393
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:07,866
My big brother failed
in just one aspect.

394
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,701
He let me,
his little brother, live.

395
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,995
Unable to hide the truth from me,

396
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,122
he allowed the hatred
to disseminate.

397
00:31:18,242 --> 00:31:21,655
However... I'm not like
my Big Brother anymore.

398
00:31:22,488 --> 00:31:24,364
I have no father, mother, brother...

399
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,551
not even a single member
of my clan.

400
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,307
I am all alone.

401
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:38,596
I alone can bear the weight
of all the hatred now.

402
00:31:39,222 --> 00:31:41,933
And I alone will deal
with everything personally.

403
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:45,811
I will handle all the
shinobi's problems.

404
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:50,441
I will also dispense
all judgment and punishment.

405
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,661
I'll concentrate
all hatred upon myself...

406
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,081
... and bring together every
single village under my control.

407
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:01,085
Hatred inside darkness
cannot be eliminated.

408
00:32:02,386 --> 00:32:03,762
In which case, I'd rather...

409
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,680
That's right...
What the Hokage is to me...

410
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,850
... is someone who will sear away
the darkness of all Five Villages

411
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:17,227
with only his own flame.

412
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:20,396
And then keeps living
by eating the ashes.

413
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:24,734
And you think everyone will just
sit back and say "yes" to that?

414
00:32:25,509 --> 00:32:26,802
I told you already...

415
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:30,281
I don't care what you
or anyone else thinks.

416
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:34,160
Besides, I have the power now
to control it all.

417
00:32:35,052 --> 00:32:38,263
You don't have a clue
about how Itachi lived!

418
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,767
There are things
you can't do alone!

419
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,686
Just like our battle with Kaguya!

420
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,799
But things don't always go well...

421
00:32:49,876 --> 00:32:51,920
Like with these two stone statues

422
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,908
<i>And us two brothers...</i>

423
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,143
With revolution...

424
00:32:59,735 --> 00:33:01,904
... the villages will no longer
have to bear darkness.

425
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,982
And I alone
will become the darkness.

426
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:08,569
I'll dispose of the deep darkness
of the past,

427
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,030
and build a pure white future
from scratch.

428
00:33:11,664 --> 00:33:13,683
You mean by killing
the Tailed Beasts,

429
00:33:13,708 --> 00:33:15,726
and the Five Kage?!

430
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,286
Exactly.

431
00:33:19,012 --> 00:33:20,580
I'm casting off the past.

432
00:33:22,617 --> 00:33:27,121
You're saying you can pretend
nothing ever happened with Itachi?

433
00:33:27,655 --> 00:33:30,950
You and Itachi were brothers,
and a lot happened between you...

434
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:32,518
That's what made you
who you are today!

435
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:36,764
Itachi is now in my past.

436
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:41,769
I'm cutting all past mistakes and
doubts here, and starting anew.

437
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:44,772
Beginning by cutting you down.

438
00:33:45,731 --> 00:33:48,235
Yours will be
the last blood I shed,

439
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,528
in the memory of my late brother.

440
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,201
I won't... let you kill me.

441
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:02,540
I learned everything I know
from the people of my past!

442
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:07,002
Especially about how to figure out
what to do after making a mistake.

443
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:10,965
<i>You said you consider
Sasuke a brother.</i>

444
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:14,002
<i>That's why, Naruto,</i>

445
00:34:14,027 --> 00:34:16,888
<i>I believe you are the only one
who can stop Sasuke.</i>

446
00:34:17,731 --> 00:34:19,566
<i>I'm leaving Sasuke to you.</i>

447
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:21,768
That's why...

448
00:34:22,802 --> 00:34:23,903
I won't let you kill me.

449
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:35,948
<i>Naruto... Sasuke...
Show me your answer...</i>

450
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,744
<i>Show me the answer for all shinobi!</i>

451
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,915
<i>Inferno Style: Honoikazuchi!</i>

452
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,371
<i>His left eye is...</i>

453
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,537
<i>How the hell do you think
you understand?</i>

454
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:16,580
<i>You've been alone from the start!</i>

455
00:40:17,122 --> 00:40:19,291
<i>It's because I have these ties,
that I feel this agony.</i>

456
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,836
<i>How could you possibly understand</i>

457
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:24,338
<i>what it feels like
to lose all that?!</i>

458
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:58,205
What's the matter?

459
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,589
Are you just going to play defense?

460
00:42:08,274 --> 00:42:10,443
If you keep stalling, you'll die.

461
00:42:15,289 --> 00:42:17,959
I don't want to kill you!

462
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:23,182
<i>To me, you've become
my closest friend.</i>

463
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:28,629
You're trying to be alone again
and I can't let that happen!

464
00:42:30,772 --> 00:42:33,408
Especially since we both know
what that's like...

465
00:42:33,433 --> 00:42:36,161
That's why I can't let you...

466
00:42:46,137 --> 00:42:47,764
... go there...

467
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,316
... intentionally!

468
00:43:26,436 --> 00:43:28,188
<i>Stop your rambling.</i>

469
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:29,940
<i>We're both different from</i>

470
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,318
<i>the two boys who
fought here long ago...</i>

471
00:43:34,327 --> 00:43:36,204
<i>I know your heart...</i>

472
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,284
<i>... and you, mine...</i>

473
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,277
<i>But you still want to fight me?</i>

474
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,456
<i>All the more, because it's you.</i>

475
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,500
<i>I have to cut you out of my life.</i>

476
00:43:49,435 --> 00:43:52,057
<i>There's no guarantee that the world</i>

477
00:43:52,579 --> 00:43:54,582
<i>you'll rebuild
after severing the past...</i>

478
00:43:54,981 --> 00:43:57,526
<i>... won't end up just like this one,
you know.</i>

479
00:43:58,461 --> 00:44:01,953
<i>That's exactly why I'll continue
to watch over that world...</i>

480
00:44:02,689 --> 00:44:04,149
<i>So it doesn't.</i>

481
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:06,477
<i>You're missing the point!</i>

482
00:44:07,093 --> 00:44:09,888
<i>The Five Villages
are finally united!</i>

483
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:15,569
<i>Yeah... But that's only because
they found a common enemy.</i>

484
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:21,450
<i>To defeat the Akatsuki, Madara,
and Kaguya...</i>

485
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:23,401
<i>the Five Villages had no choice
but to discard their grudges</i>

486
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:26,205
<i>and form an alliance
in order to survive.</i>

487
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:30,959
<i>But their mutual foes are now gone.</i>

488
00:44:31,367 --> 00:44:34,454
<i>Eventually, conflicts between
each village will begin again.</i>

489
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:39,051
<i>So this time,
you're going to become the enemy?</i>

490
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:42,979
<i>And? What'll happen
after you're gone?</i>

491
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,016
<i>Finally,</i>

492
00:44:46,458 --> 00:44:48,668
<i>all the dots have connected
and formed a straight line.</i>

493
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:51,230
<i>I started with the Sharingan</i>

494
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:53,549
<i>and now, I possess
the power of the Rinnegan.</i>

495
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:58,153
<i>Reincarnation, immortality...
I have many options.</i>

496
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:01,274
<i>I'll also be able to control things
from the shadows,</i>

497
00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:02,967
<i>instead of through battle.</i>

498
00:45:03,769 --> 00:45:05,994
<i>You're planning to
return to that hell,</i>

499
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:09,848
<i>for the rest of your life,
or rather for all eternity?</i>

500
00:45:10,065 --> 00:45:11,316
<i>While being hated by all?</i>

501
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:17,915
<i>To me,
that's what a Hokage ought to be.</i>

502
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:32,529
That's not even
close enough to kill me.

503
00:45:33,088 --> 00:45:36,383
I told you!
I'm not trying to kill you!

504
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:38,026
I'm—!

505
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,153
Enough.

506
00:46:15,805 --> 00:46:18,909
I'm the strongest in
this world right now.

507
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:21,236
So right now, right here...

508
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,323
will be my first step
into the shadows.

509
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:45,677
<i>This is bad...</i>

510
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:49,806
<i>He's merging all the chakra
that's been scattered into one...</i>

511
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:52,559
<i>And doing it unbelievably well too,
almost unrivaled.</i>

512
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,978
<i>He's just as good as
Old Man Six Paths...</i>

513
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:58,065
<i>Well, except he's doing
the reverse thing...</i>

514
00:46:58,265 --> 00:47:02,277
<i>There's no Gedo Statue here, so he's
making the Susano'o the receiving vessel.</i>

515
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,571
<i>Something incredible
is going to emerge...</i>

516
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,490
<i>Don't let down your guard, Naruto!</i>

517
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:38,981
That jutsu again?

518
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:40,899
Naruto...

519
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:44,736
That jutsu of yours
symbolizes your weakness.

520
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:46,864
That's right...

521
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:50,267
It's a jutsu that covers up
your loneliness!

522
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,753
<i>Why that—!</i>

523
00:49:34,821 --> 00:49:38,283
You only hold a little piece of
each Tailed Beast's chakra...

524
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,519
You can't win against me now.

525
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,730
Nor this...

526
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:58,495
Not yet?!

527
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,488
Kurama!

528
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,833
<i>I might have amassed too much, in fact.</i>

529
00:50:02,858 --> 00:50:04,943
<i>It's everything that's available.</i>

530
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,301
<i>Here it comes!</i>

531
00:50:11,916 --> 00:50:12,785
Here it comes!

532
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:16,888
<i>I can feel it!</i>

533
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:19,623
<i>How did he gain so much
Nature Energy so suddenly?</i>

534
00:50:26,255 --> 00:50:27,315
<i>Let's do this!</i>

535
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:28,467
Yeah!

536
00:50:36,375 --> 00:50:38,877
You finally decided to kill me, huh?

537
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:43,874
We've taken on a lot of responsibilities
upon our shoulders...

538
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:51,423
But you see,

539
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,383
I...

540
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:56,928
<i>I want to fight you too.</i>

541
00:51:00,833 --> 00:51:04,378
I want to fight,
and win against you fair and square!

542
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:08,023
But...

543
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,067
... not against the current you!

544
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,569
You already know that too...

545
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:13,737
right, Sasuke?!

546
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:24,122
<i>This fight with you right now,
will be my last.</i>

547
00:51:25,289 --> 00:51:26,599
<i>Indra's Arrow...</i>

548
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:29,669
<i>Currently, the most powerful jutsu
in my arsenal...</i>

549
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,132
<i>So just... die.</i>

550
00:51:36,509 --> 00:51:37,636
<i>Just be gone already!</i>

551
00:53:17,644 --> 00:53:18,486
Damn it...

552
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:20,630
You're not—!

553
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,158
<i>Naruto!</i>

554
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:26,453
<i>If my Nature Energy
didn't make it to you in time,</i>

555
00:53:26,478 --> 00:53:28,355
<i>you'd have been
blown away just now!</i>

556
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:31,356
<i>And your chakra's already
long been drained from—</i>

557
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:32,383
<i>Amaterasu!</i>

558
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,016
<i>Only a diversion, huh?</i>

559
00:53:48,641 --> 00:53:50,768
<i>I can't actually take
him down with this...</i>

560
00:53:51,169 --> 00:53:52,220
<i>I need the Tailed Beasts...</i>

561
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:57,176
<i>I've used too much chakra...
can't maintain control!</i>

562
00:53:57,525 --> 00:54:00,862
<i>At this rate, I can't use
my left eye's abilities either!</i>

563
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:39,753
<i>He's still not—!</i>

564
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:43,923
Give it up already...

565
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:50,005
– Sasuke!
– Naruto!

566
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:31,270
Damn it!

567
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,643
Sasuke wins!

568
00:56:37,218 --> 00:56:39,069
All right, both of you,
make the Unison Sign.

569
00:56:40,312 --> 00:56:42,005
Not even a nod of acknowledgment?!

570
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:43,031
You jerk!

571
00:56:43,425 --> 00:56:45,693
I've got to get this off my chest!

572
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:49,531
You jerk! No, you colossal loser!

573
00:56:51,432 --> 00:56:52,475
Ouch!

574
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:56,004
I told you that shinobi Kumite is
a time-honored and sacred tradition!

575
00:56:56,862 --> 00:56:58,864
Now, make the Unison Sign now!

576
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:15,723
You're finally awake.

577
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:24,023
It's dusk already.

578
00:57:27,085 --> 00:57:28,652
Where are Sasuke and Naruto?

579
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:33,265
They're currently fighting
their final battle...

580
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:36,077
... in order to settle things for good.

581
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:53,898
<i>Hang in there!</i>

582
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:56,001
<i>It's not much, but I've finished
infusing some more chakra—!</i>

583
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:04,267
This is one of the abilities
of the Rinnegan.

584
01:00:05,117 --> 01:00:10,205
As someone who possesses
the eyes of the Uchiha...

585
01:00:10,698 --> 01:00:12,492
My victory is inevitable.

586
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:19,115
<i>Now...</i>

587
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:25,288
<i>Now, I can finally be alone!</i>

588
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:29,525
Farewell...

589
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:32,995
My one and only...

590
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:33,829
friend!

591
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:57,445
<i>That was a great counter!</i>

592
01:00:57,570 --> 01:01:00,657
<i>You didn't miss the fact that
his visual prowess is weakened!</i>

593
01:01:16,672 --> 01:01:17,840
Over and...

594
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:21,803
... over and...

595
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:25,063
... over and...

596
01:01:25,906 --> 01:01:27,366
... over and...

597
01:01:28,118 --> 01:01:28,918
... over and...

598
01:01:28,943 --> 01:01:32,906
... over and over
and over again!

599
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:39,737
Just give up and
let me cut you down!

600
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:45,743
Can't do that.

601
01:01:51,456 --> 01:01:54,835
'Cuz I'm your one and only friend!

602
01:02:12,178 --> 01:02:13,538
<i>I figured as much...</i>

603
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:17,442
<i>He's assimilated the chakra I created
and infused for you, and made it his own...</i>

604
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:20,069
<i>And now Flame Control...</i>

605
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,739
<i>He intends to finish this
with one last blast.</i>

606
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:27,076
<i>Listen, I'm giving what remains
of my own chakra...</i>

607
01:02:27,877 --> 01:02:30,046
<i>Once I do that,
it's going to put me to sleep.</i>

608
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:32,689
<i>Don't unleash your jutsu
until the last minute,</i>

609
01:02:32,714 --> 01:02:34,341
<i>so he doesn't absorb
more chakra from you.</i>

610
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:37,469
<i>Well, not that he can use
his newly awakened Rinnegan</i>

611
01:02:37,494 --> 01:02:40,872
<i>to absorb chakra while
putting out his own jutsu...</i>

612
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:18,920
<i>Who are you to be so confident when
you couldn't even save Sasuke?</i>

613
01:03:18,945 --> 01:03:20,697
<i>I've never given up...</i>

614
01:03:20,722 --> 01:03:22,682
<i>Once you give up, it's over.</i>

615
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,801
<i>I will save Sasuke, and...</i>

616
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:32,058
<i>I'm coming after all that hate
inside you too, someday!</i>

617
01:03:35,044 --> 01:03:36,587
<i>Now go...</i>

618
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:40,316
<i>You're the one and only
for us too...</i>

619
01:03:45,078 --> 01:03:47,914
<i>That's why Sasuke is...</i>

620
01:05:56,702 --> 01:05:57,912
Sasuke wins!

621
01:06:00,231 --> 01:06:01,816
All right, you two...
make the Unison Sign.

622
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:34,657
You want a piece of me, you loser?

623
01:06:41,179 --> 01:06:42,180
What is this?

624
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:51,924
Am I dead?

625
01:06:53,425 --> 01:06:55,328
This sensation...

626
01:06:55,953 --> 01:06:57,829
It must be...

627
01:06:59,364 --> 01:07:00,248
Probably.

628
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:17,624
Pitiful, isn't it?

629
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:26,542
You had the Nine-Tails...

630
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:29,086
and I was an Uchiha.

631
01:07:29,628 --> 01:07:32,715
We were ostracized from the village
and treated like outcasts.

632
01:07:35,259 --> 01:07:39,221
And we resented the village
and its people.

633
01:07:41,373 --> 01:07:42,157
Right?

634
01:07:50,958 --> 01:07:52,417
I won't let you say I'm wrong.

635
01:07:54,828 --> 01:08:00,208
You called me your brother...
In that sense, perhaps we were.

636
01:08:00,951 --> 01:08:02,661
You're totally wrong!

637
01:08:02,945 --> 01:08:05,405
Damn it,
you don't understand, do you?

638
01:08:34,125 --> 01:08:36,878
Sorry, Grandma Tsunade...

639
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:43,410
I promised... I wouldn't die...

640
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:46,622
until I became the Hokage...

641
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:56,740
Oh yeah! The Infinite Tsukuyomi!

642
01:08:57,392 --> 01:08:58,676
This is bad!

643
01:08:58,701 --> 01:09:01,412
The Release Jutsu can't be activated
without us being there, right?!

644
01:09:04,181 --> 01:09:08,077
You're dead... and you're worried
about what happens to the world?

645
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:09,870
Of course!

646
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:11,647
We can't leave it like that!

647
01:09:12,981 --> 01:09:14,983
Sakura and Kakashi still remain.

648
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:17,194
They'll figure something out.

649
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:21,157
I hope so.

650
01:09:29,397 --> 01:09:30,174
Naruto!

651
01:09:48,642 --> 01:09:50,394
The Hokage, huh...

652
01:09:58,076 --> 01:10:03,540
<i>Pretty soon, Big Brother, they might
carve your face into the rock over there!</i>

653
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:12,374
Big Brother?

654
01:10:34,488 --> 01:10:38,867
<i>Forgive me, Sasuke. This is it.</i>

655
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,407
<i>And no matter what you do
from here on out, know this...</i>

656
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:49,036
<i>I will love you always.</i>

657
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:00,172
<i>Big Brother...</i>

658
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:04,450
<i>I'll be seeing you... soon.</i>

659
01:11:09,223 --> 01:11:10,599
You've finally come to, eh?

660
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:18,357
As you can see...

661
01:11:19,149 --> 01:11:23,404
if either of us moves too much,
we'll bleed out and die.

662
01:11:25,906 --> 01:11:27,424
Why would you go that far?

663
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:29,702
Why do all that...

664
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:31,578
just to get in my way?

665
01:11:34,873 --> 01:11:38,877
I gained the power to enter the darkness,
and sever all bonds...

666
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:46,510
And naturally, everyone's tried to cut
their ties to me as well, at some point.

667
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:49,680
But you...

668
01:11:50,347 --> 01:11:52,474
You've never attempted
to cut me off.

669
01:11:53,517 --> 01:11:57,354
<i>The only one who can handle
all that hatred is me!</i>

670
01:11:59,189 --> 01:12:02,359
Why do you keep
involving yourself with me?

671
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:06,697
You already know, don't you?

672
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:11,427
Now that your body can't move,
your mouth sure is moving a lot.

673
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:12,870
Just answer me!

674
01:12:18,542 --> 01:12:19,752
'Cuz you're my friend.

675
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:24,965
<i>What is it with you anyway?</i>

676
01:12:25,499 --> 01:12:27,041
<i>I'm your friend!</i>

677
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:33,140
<i>Just what the hell do you want?
Why are you so fixated on me?</i>

678
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:34,850
<i>It's because I'm your friend!</i>

679
01:12:39,304 --> 01:12:40,931
I've heard that before.

680
01:12:41,633 --> 01:12:43,567
But what exactly does that mean

681
01:12:43,883 --> 01:12:45,026
to you anyway?

682
01:12:47,979 --> 01:12:52,571
You ask me to explain it,
but I really can't put it into words.

683
01:12:54,661 --> 01:12:56,038
It's just that...

684
01:12:56,547 --> 01:12:58,832
when I see you take on stuff...

685
01:12:58,974 --> 01:13:00,684
and get all messed up...

686
01:13:01,602 --> 01:13:02,552
It kinda...

687
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:07,341
hurts me.

688
01:13:09,643 --> 01:13:12,229
It hurts so much inside,

689
01:13:12,688 --> 01:13:16,567
that I can't just leave it alone, y'know?

690
01:13:18,919 --> 01:13:22,923
Though right now, it hurts so much,
I can't really do anything.

691
01:13:28,486 --> 01:13:34,284
<i>Naruto... I knew you were
always alone back then.</i>

692
01:13:35,452 --> 01:13:38,038
<i>The village shunned you,
just like they did with me...</i>

693
01:13:38,063 --> 01:13:40,273
<i>the lone Uchiha survivor.</i>

694
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:45,963
<i>You intentionally did stupid things
to get scolded,</i>

695
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:48,424
<i>most likely to get people's attention.</i>

696
01:13:49,216 --> 01:13:52,636
<i>In the beginning, I thought
you were good for nothing.</i>

697
01:13:53,310 --> 01:13:55,521
<i>A weakling who just constantly
wanted to goof around.</i>

698
01:13:56,473 --> 01:14:00,519
<i>But the more I watched you doing stupid things
and getting scolded over and over...</i>

699
01:14:01,128 --> 01:14:03,297
<i>For some reason,
it started weighing on my mind.</i>

700
01:14:04,481 --> 01:14:09,820
<i>I thought back then, that your weakness
was gradually rubbing off on me.</i>

701
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:14,908
<i>Then, every time I'd see you,
I'd think about you more and more.</i>

702
01:14:15,758 --> 01:14:18,761
<i>Seeing you desperately
trying to bond with others...</i>

703
01:14:19,596 --> 01:14:22,133
<i>made me remember my own family.</i>

704
01:14:23,584 --> 01:14:26,712
<i>And I don't know why,
but I felt relief.</i>

705
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:32,092
<i>But at the same time,
I considered it a weakness.</i>

706
01:14:33,518 --> 01:14:36,521
<i>I trained hard
as if to escape that weakness.</i>

707
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:39,349
<i>In order to get my revenge
on my brother</i>

708
01:14:39,823 --> 01:14:41,592
<i>to become stronger than him.</i>

709
01:14:42,985 --> 01:14:46,030
<i>And yet... I ended up
on the same team as you.</i>

710
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:48,817
<i>And I began thinking about
my family again.</i>

711
01:14:50,503 --> 01:14:51,754
<i>I went on missions with you</i>

712
01:14:51,779 --> 01:14:54,031
<i>as you jabbered on and on
about becoming Hokage...</i>

713
01:14:54,565 --> 01:14:57,209
<i>I saw how both of us
were getting stronger...</i>

714
01:14:57,767 --> 01:15:02,706
<i>And one day, I started to feel
the desire to fight you too.</i>

715
01:15:03,682 --> 01:15:08,145
<i>And I began to see a shadow
of my own family in Team 7...</i>

716
01:15:09,421 --> 01:15:12,633
<i>That's why every time
I saw you suffering...</i>

717
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:15,928
<i>That's right...
I felt it...</i>

718
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:19,890
<i>I felt pain too.</i>

719
01:15:22,183 --> 01:15:26,146
<i>When I understood your hurt,
I finally saw you as a comrade.</i>

720
01:15:27,314 --> 01:15:29,024
<i>But on the other hand...</i>

721
01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:32,861
<i>I couldn't leave you alone.
You were getting stronger and stronger.</i>

722
01:15:33,621 --> 01:15:36,148
<i>Watching you steadily get stronger...</i>

723
01:15:37,348 --> 01:15:38,349
<i>I...</i>

724
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:43,497
<i>I knew that you were always alone.</i>

725
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:46,250
<i>I wanted to walk over and start talking.</i>

726
01:15:46,891 --> 01:15:49,018
<i>I'd get sort of giddy.</i>

727
01:15:50,295 --> 01:15:52,005
<i>But I stopped myself.</i>

728
01:15:52,847 --> 01:15:55,266
<i>I was jealous because
you were good at everything.</i>

729
01:15:55,742 --> 01:15:59,579
<i>So I made you my rival.</i>

730
01:16:00,597 --> 01:16:02,558
<i>You've been...</i>

731
01:16:04,309 --> 01:16:05,811
<i>my goal.</i>

732
01:16:06,578 --> 01:16:09,395
<i>I had nothing, and I found a bond.</i>

733
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:13,527
<i>I wanted to be strong
and cool like you.</i>

734
01:16:14,361 --> 01:16:16,697
<i>That's why I kept chasing after you.</i>

735
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:18,282
<i>It was the opposite.</i>

736
01:16:19,407 --> 01:16:21,951
<i>In reality, I was the one
who was jealous of you.</i>

737
01:16:23,036 --> 01:16:25,372
<i>Because you had a strength
that I didn't.</i>

738
01:16:26,548 --> 01:16:30,093
<i>You were always walking
in front of me.</i>

739
01:16:33,230 --> 01:16:34,898
<i>Just like my late Big Brother.</i>

740
01:16:37,766 --> 01:16:40,060
<i>And... even today...</i>

741
01:16:41,579 --> 01:16:43,706
<i>I'll let you deal with Sasuke.</i>

742
01:16:44,482 --> 01:16:46,443
<i>That was my plan from the start!</i>

743
01:16:47,311 --> 01:16:49,730
<i>Entrusting it to you was
the right thing to do, after all.</i>

744
01:16:51,998 --> 01:16:53,208
<i>These are—!</i>

745
01:16:53,332 --> 01:16:54,750
<i>Naruto's memories.</i>

746
01:16:55,485 --> 01:16:57,237
<i>My dream...</i>

747
01:16:57,321 --> 01:16:58,822
<i>is to surpass the Hokage one day!</i>

748
01:16:58,905 --> 01:17:00,616
<i>And that's why I'm going to</i>

749
01:17:00,699 --> 01:17:03,785
<i>make everyone in the village
acknowledge me!</i>

750
01:17:04,978 --> 01:17:07,022
<i>I have to be ready...</i>

751
01:17:07,331 --> 01:17:12,378
<i>I'm going to be called the Hokage,
someone that everyone acknowledges.</i>

752
01:17:12,753 --> 01:17:15,964
<i>There's no such thing as a shortcut!</i>

753
01:17:17,006 --> 01:17:19,967
<i>Quit messin' around,
I'll never run away!</i>

754
01:17:20,653 --> 01:17:22,237
<i>I will make it!</i>

755
01:17:22,262 --> 01:17:24,556
<i>Even if I stay a Genin
for the rest of my life,</i>

756
01:17:24,889 --> 01:17:28,302
<i>I'll become the Hokage.
So I don't care!</i>

757
01:17:29,394 --> 01:17:34,148
<i>I never go back on my word.
That's my ninja way!</i>

758
01:17:35,267 --> 01:17:38,436
<i>I'm different from you.</i>

759
01:17:38,861 --> 01:17:42,532
<i>I'm absolutely going to
become the Hokage.</i>

760
01:17:43,533 --> 01:17:46,411
<i>Becoming the Hokage is my dream.</i>

761
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:52,751
<i>I won't die...
until I become the Hokage!</i>

762
01:17:53,418 --> 01:17:57,464
<i>I'm going to become the Hokage
to surpass all the previous ones!</i>

763
01:17:57,923 --> 01:18:00,509
<i>That's my dream, you idiot!</i>

764
01:18:00,717 --> 01:18:03,862
<i>The Hokage is someone
who endures the pain</i>

765
01:18:04,036 --> 01:18:06,589
<i>and takes the lead
in front of everyone.</i>

766
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:10,143
<i>So a Hokage never walks over
his comrades' corpses.</i>

767
01:18:11,036 --> 01:18:13,538
<i>There is no shortcut
to becoming the Hokage!</i>

768
01:18:14,147 --> 01:18:17,442
<i>And there is no running away
for the one who becomes Hokage!</i>

769
01:18:18,927 --> 01:18:23,473
<i>No way can a guy who can't even
save one friend become the Hokage.</i>

770
01:18:24,449 --> 01:18:26,785
<i>Isn't that right, Sasuke?</i>

771
01:18:46,630 --> 01:18:47,905
<i>Naruto...</i>

772
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:51,810
<i>How far... have you—?</i>

773
01:18:55,556 --> 01:18:59,359
<i>No matter how powerful you become,
don't try to shoulder everything alone.</i>

774
01:19:00,943 --> 01:19:03,696
<i>You share your father's dream,
don't you?</i>

775
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:05,532
<i>Then don't ever forget...</i>

776
01:19:07,284 --> 01:19:10,412
<i>Becoming Hokage doesn't mean
people will acknowledge you.</i>

777
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:14,374
<i>But when the people acknowledge you,
you can become Hokage.</i>

778
01:19:17,377 --> 01:19:18,795
<i>Never forget your friends!</i>

779
01:19:22,673 --> 01:19:23,841
<i>Big Brother...</i>

780
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:12,659
I see.

781
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:14,786
Then...

782
01:21:16,329 --> 01:21:17,455
show me...

783
01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:27,499
Where are we?

784
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:31,553
Don't tell me this is really
Heaven this time?

785
01:21:32,553 --> 01:21:35,681
Looks like we fell asleep
and slept until morning.

786
01:21:36,741 --> 01:21:38,660
We've failed to die again.

787
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:45,275
Damn it! I still can't move!

788
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:50,530
I was hoping to punch you hard and
make you finally open your eyes!

789
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:56,536
Wh-What is it?

790
01:21:57,512 --> 01:22:00,682
We're messed up like this,
and you still want to fight?

791
01:22:00,974 --> 01:22:02,809
Damn right! No matter
how many times it takes—

792
01:22:02,834 --> 01:22:04,044
I admit it.

793
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:07,923
I've...

794
01:22:11,092 --> 01:22:12,135
lost.

795
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:17,849
You idiot!

796
01:22:18,408 --> 01:22:21,578
This fight isn't about winning or losing!

797
01:22:21,894 --> 01:22:24,689
It's about punching a sulking friend,
to make him snap out of it!

798
01:22:24,731 --> 01:22:25,941
That's what it's about!

799
01:22:26,232 --> 01:22:29,319
The real match that I want,
comes after that!

800
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:31,529
Hey, Naruto...

801
01:22:34,057 --> 01:22:37,244
I just acknowledged you.

802
01:22:40,246 --> 01:22:43,458
If I die here, the long cycle of destiny
the Sage of Six Paths mentioned

803
01:22:43,483 --> 01:22:45,027
will probably end as well.

804
01:22:45,710 --> 01:22:48,463
This is... a kind of revolution too.

805
01:22:49,881 --> 01:22:52,709
You can release the Infinite Tsukuyomi
after I'm dead,

806
01:22:53,176 --> 01:22:55,679
by transplanting my left eye
into Kakashi or someone else.

807
01:22:58,598 --> 01:23:04,270
I'll put an end to myself.

808
01:23:06,256 --> 01:23:09,551
By dying?
Don't think dying will settle this!

809
01:23:10,093 --> 01:23:13,096
If you're willing to die,
then live and help me instead.

810
01:23:13,714 --> 01:23:17,217
What I want to do is to make
all shinobi cooperate with each other.

811
01:23:17,242 --> 01:23:19,186
And that definitely includes you!

812
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:23,957
Just because you want that
doesn't mean others will agree to it.

813
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:28,461
Damn it! If you keep whining and sulking,
I'll slug you again!

814
01:23:29,054 --> 01:23:32,362
There's no guarantee
I won't stand against you again...

815
01:23:32,387 --> 01:23:33,972
Then I'll stop you again!

816
01:23:34,384 --> 01:23:37,345
Besides, I know you're not going to
do that kinda thing anymore.

817
01:23:38,929 --> 01:23:41,056
How can you be so sure?

818
01:23:41,582 --> 01:23:44,602
Don't make me repeat myself!

819
01:23:47,872 --> 01:23:50,642
Haven't you figured it out yet?!

820
01:23:51,234 --> 01:23:52,610
Now that I think about it...

821
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:54,470
You were always pretty stupid too...

822
01:24:39,866 --> 01:24:40,867
There they are!

823
01:24:41,258 --> 01:24:42,492
It figures they'd be here.

824
01:25:09,896 --> 01:25:11,898
Thanks, Sakura.

825
01:25:12,607 --> 01:25:14,109
Sakura...

826
01:25:14,209 --> 01:25:15,001
Never mind me...

827
01:25:15,026 --> 01:25:16,111
Stay quiet now.

828
01:25:17,237 --> 01:25:18,238
I need to concentrate.

829
01:25:24,035 --> 01:25:25,120
I'm sorry...

830
01:25:26,445 --> 01:25:29,031
Sorry? For what?

831
01:25:31,876 --> 01:25:33,169
For everything...

832
01:25:34,169 --> 01:25:35,170
You should be.

833
01:25:38,174 --> 01:25:39,467
Really... you...

834
01:25:47,124 --> 01:25:48,417
damn...

835
01:25:49,769 --> 01:25:50,854
idiot!

836
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:19,507
He's finally back.

837
01:26:24,594 --> 01:26:25,637
<i>Naruto...</i>

838
01:26:26,097 --> 01:26:30,351
<i>I've been thinking about
what you once said to me.</i>

839
01:26:31,811 --> 01:26:33,396
<i>When we were together,</i>

840
01:26:33,479 --> 01:26:36,399
<i>you wondered if it was
how having a brother would feel...</i>

841
01:26:44,140 --> 01:26:45,558
<i>Now, finally...</i>

842
01:26:45,891 --> 01:26:48,769
<i>I think I know what you meant.</i>

843
01:28:26,225 --> 01:28:32,397
<i>I felt how my mother, father,
and brother Itachi suffered.</i>

844
01:28:32,682 --> 01:28:35,085
<i>In that same way...</i>

845
01:28:43,125 --> 01:28:44,477
<i>Naruto...</i>

846
01:28:45,069 --> 01:28:49,532
<i>I'm sure I will start to feel your pain
and your emotions...</i>

847
01:28:51,075 --> 01:28:53,202
<i>You never cut me off.</i>

848
01:28:53,562 --> 01:28:56,331
<i>You always kept me in your thoughts.</i>

849
01:29:16,775 --> 01:29:17,985
Naruto...

850
01:29:40,448 --> 01:29:44,837
<i>You'd have been justified if
you'd come at me with hatred...</i>

851
01:29:46,113 --> 01:29:50,242
<i>Instead, you always called me
your friend.</i>

852
01:29:56,224 --> 01:30:00,311
<i>And I tried to betray
even those feelings...</i>

853
01:30:09,529 --> 01:30:11,322
As I explained,
it's the village policy.

854
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:16,994
Only those authorized are allowed
at the interview.

855
01:30:17,220 --> 01:30:19,097
All others, please leave!

856
01:30:19,122 --> 01:30:22,458
What? Do you know
how far I traveled?

857
01:30:22,684 --> 01:30:24,394
Let us see him, just once!

858
01:30:24,419 --> 01:30:25,711
– Yeah!
– Yeah!

859
01:30:25,837 --> 01:30:28,457
It's the village policy...

860
01:30:28,482 --> 01:30:30,109
– Let us see Naruto!
– Let us see Naruto!

861
01:30:30,383 --> 01:30:32,635
Please don't push! It's dangerous.

862
01:30:38,933 --> 01:30:42,311
This should settle
the succession.

863
01:30:43,371 --> 01:30:44,657
It's a lot of paper.

864
01:30:45,314 --> 01:30:46,399
Yeah...

865
01:30:47,566 --> 01:30:51,237
Anyway, congratulations on becoming
the Sixth Hokage, Kakashi.

866
01:30:51,988 --> 01:30:53,072
Thank you.

867
01:30:53,656 --> 01:30:56,909
I just wonder...
Can I do this?

868
01:30:57,092 --> 01:31:01,638
You'll manage. After all, I did.

869
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:03,482
I'll do my best.

870
01:31:05,418 --> 01:31:06,419
Excuse me.

871
01:31:10,715 --> 01:31:11,924
Status report:

872
01:31:11,949 --> 01:31:14,034
The Raikage's entourage and

873
01:31:14,059 --> 01:31:16,603
the Kazekage's entourage
have arrived.

874
01:31:17,546 --> 01:31:20,758
May I escort them to Naruto, too?

875
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:22,101
You may.

876
01:31:28,974 --> 01:31:29,975
Further...

877
01:31:32,377 --> 01:31:33,511
I have a request.

878
01:31:37,107 --> 01:31:39,443
I see, Shikamaru.

879
01:31:40,161 --> 01:31:42,246
I understand your intentions.

880
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:47,168
I want to get some experience
and improve my prospects too.

881
01:31:48,794 --> 01:31:50,129
All that's left is him.

882
01:31:50,796 --> 01:31:53,257
A ton of visitors are asking about him.

883
01:31:53,841 --> 01:31:55,760
Suddenly he's Mr. Popular.

884
01:31:56,260 --> 01:31:57,261
That's all right.

885
01:31:58,012 --> 01:32:01,307
He's not the type to get carried away.

886
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:06,020
Hey! Gaara!

887
01:32:08,814 --> 01:32:10,024
Naruto...

888
01:32:22,495 --> 01:32:26,290
You... saved me yet again.

889
01:32:27,225 --> 01:32:28,668
And us.

890
01:32:31,629 --> 01:32:33,547
How's your wound?

891
01:32:34,215 --> 01:32:36,300
It's about what you'd guess.

892
01:32:37,026 --> 01:32:39,111
Can't say I'm in the best shape.

893
01:32:39,595 --> 01:32:42,765
Then, what'll you do about that arm?

894
01:32:43,532 --> 01:32:46,425
Oh, Grandma Tsunade said
something about

895
01:32:46,733 --> 01:32:52,149
harvesting cells from Hashirama,
the First Hokage, or whatever.

896
01:32:52,483 --> 01:32:54,610
She's going to fuse them with mine,
I suppose?

897
01:32:55,111 --> 01:32:57,321
I don't really understand.

898
01:32:58,315 --> 01:33:01,015
Will it be as good as new?

899
01:33:01,709 --> 01:33:03,576
Yeah! I think.

900
01:33:04,619 --> 01:33:07,247
I'm here today so they can check.

901
01:33:07,957 --> 01:33:09,041
I see...

902
01:33:09,542 --> 01:33:14,714
Naruto is the ninja world's sun!
His right arm is second to none!

903
01:33:14,897 --> 01:33:17,748
Losing it is devastation! Yay!

904
01:33:18,092 --> 01:33:22,471
So to get it back intact!
Use Hashirama's cells, in fact.

905
01:33:22,696 --> 01:33:26,917
It'll be as good as new
and back on track! Yay!

906
01:33:31,856 --> 01:33:34,859
What's he up to?

907
01:33:40,781 --> 01:33:44,285
I really don't want to say much.

908
01:33:47,029 --> 01:33:48,472
I promised I wouldn't.

909
01:33:49,790 --> 01:33:50,916
I see.

910
01:34:02,261 --> 01:34:04,472
S-Sensei!

911
01:34:05,264 --> 01:34:06,682
Don't cry, Lee!

912
01:34:09,101 --> 01:34:13,923
Even if the springtime of my youth ends
here, there is still a future for me!

913
01:34:15,608 --> 01:34:17,652
The sun that shines bright!

914
01:34:17,835 --> 01:34:19,795
The sweltering heat!

915
01:34:20,171 --> 01:34:24,592
The red-hot days of
summer are here!

916
01:34:30,414 --> 01:34:32,166
O-Oww...

917
01:34:33,209 --> 01:34:35,043
Guy-sensei!

918
01:34:35,111 --> 01:34:38,781
I'm inspired!
What a brilliant way of thinking!

919
01:34:39,048 --> 01:34:40,091
<i>Oh yuck...</i>

920
01:34:42,927 --> 01:34:43,928
Shikamaru...

921
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:47,181
I hear you're
the Hokage's personal assistant.

922
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:49,016
Well, yeah.

923
01:34:49,858 --> 01:34:52,235
I have to keep moving forward too.

924
01:34:55,631 --> 01:34:58,967
So why'd you ask me to
come to the Academy?

925
01:35:03,155 --> 01:35:06,283
Iruka-sensei? And Kakashi-sensei?

926
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:10,454
More like Lord Hokage now.

927
01:35:10,913 --> 01:35:13,165
Huh?! When did that—?!

928
01:35:13,799 --> 01:35:16,259
You must have seen all the messages
that came in this morning.

929
01:35:16,836 --> 01:35:19,021
I had no idea...

930
01:35:19,046 --> 01:35:20,798
Don't worry about it.

931
01:35:22,174 --> 01:35:24,677
So what do I call you?

932
01:35:25,261 --> 01:35:26,554
Kakashi Hokage?

933
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:29,098
Hokage Kakashi Teacher?

934
01:35:29,682 --> 01:35:32,309
Well, let's decide that later.

935
01:35:33,944 --> 01:35:35,029
Naruto!

936
01:35:37,238 --> 01:35:40,700
You never got to take
the Chunin Exam, right?

937
01:35:41,234 --> 01:35:42,094
No...

938
01:35:43,786 --> 01:35:45,113
Naruto Uzumaki!

939
01:35:46,049 --> 01:35:48,117
I, the Sixth Hokage, hereby grant you

940
01:35:48,325 --> 01:35:51,946
the rank of Jonin of
the Hidden Leaf Village.

941
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:57,209
... is what I'd like to tell you.

942
01:35:57,384 --> 01:36:00,103
But there's something
you must complete before that.

943
01:36:06,609 --> 01:36:09,279
The educational materials
you'll be needing.

944
01:36:09,511 --> 01:36:11,115
You mean...?

945
01:36:11,347 --> 01:36:13,391
Yes, you have to study.

946
01:36:13,827 --> 01:36:15,870
Study?!

947
01:36:15,895 --> 01:36:17,313
No way!

948
01:36:17,688 --> 01:36:19,139
No way, no way!

949
01:36:19,164 --> 01:36:22,042
If I'm going to have to study,
I'll just stay a Genin!

950
01:36:22,459 --> 01:36:23,910
Hold on, Naruto.

951
01:36:24,862 --> 01:36:27,740
There's no shortcut to
becoming the Hokage!

952
01:36:27,765 --> 01:36:28,915
Got it?!

953
01:36:31,476 --> 01:36:32,226
Naruto...

954
01:36:33,312 --> 01:36:35,556
I don't have to tell you

955
01:36:35,581 --> 01:36:38,125
that your skill as a shinobi
is second to none.

956
01:36:39,535 --> 01:36:42,338
However, if your goal is
to become the Hokage...

957
01:36:42,980 --> 01:36:47,301
You must learn how to stand
above others and lead them.

958
01:36:48,761 --> 01:36:53,140
You catch on fast,
and for most things,

959
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:55,518
Shikamaru will support you
with his resourcefulness.

960
01:36:55,867 --> 01:36:59,913
Still, a minimum of learning
and knowledge is essential.

961
01:37:00,355 --> 01:37:04,001
We're rivals who both aim to
become Hokage, right?!

962
01:37:20,393 --> 01:37:22,311
You really dug in, Naruto.

963
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:25,773
Two more years,
and you can become a Jonin.

964
01:37:25,798 --> 01:37:28,259
So long...

965
01:37:28,735 --> 01:37:31,152
Okay, let's call it a day

966
01:37:31,177 --> 01:37:32,512
and go grab some ramen.

967
01:37:33,438 --> 01:37:34,631
All right!

968
01:37:37,268 --> 01:37:41,105
Now what toppings should I choose?

969
01:37:41,105 --> 01:37:43,482
Hey, don't get carried away.

970
01:37:55,911 --> 01:37:57,788
It's all thanks to you, Iruka-sensei.

971
01:37:58,288 --> 01:37:59,039
Huh?

972
01:38:00,165 --> 01:38:02,334
Do you remember that day?

973
01:38:02,893 --> 01:38:03,852
Hmm?

974
01:38:04,286 --> 01:38:06,530
That night, Sensei...

975
01:38:06,964 --> 01:38:09,091
You accepted me.

976
01:38:09,850 --> 01:38:11,226
It was the first time ever.

977
01:38:12,334 --> 01:38:15,379
That's why I'm here today.

978
01:38:16,582 --> 01:38:20,135
If no one acknowledged me
and I stayed the way I was...

979
01:38:20,895 --> 01:38:24,398
Maybe I would've resented the village
and everyone in it, and gone wild.

980
01:38:25,992 --> 01:38:31,071
But your words
that night changed me.

981
01:38:32,173 --> 01:38:34,383
<i>But Naruto is different.</i>

982
01:38:35,409 --> 01:38:36,827
<i>He's...</i>

983
01:38:37,161 --> 01:38:41,749
<i>He's an exceptional student
and I acknowledge him!</i>

984
01:38:42,390 --> 01:38:43,808
<i>He is...</i>

985
01:38:44,126 --> 01:38:48,839
<i>Naruto Uzumaki of the Hidden Leaf!</i>

986
01:38:50,215 --> 01:38:53,135
Thank you, Iruka-sensei.

987
01:38:57,389 --> 01:38:59,558
That... that does it!

988
01:38:59,892 --> 01:39:03,312
Today, you can have
all the toppings you want!

989
01:39:04,939 --> 01:39:06,273
Awright!

990
01:39:18,035 --> 01:39:19,036
Sasuke...

991
01:39:23,139 --> 01:39:24,383
I'll be blunt.

992
01:39:24,408 --> 01:39:28,337
By rights, you should be
in prison right now.

993
01:39:28,620 --> 01:39:30,747
But we have heard your plea and

994
01:39:30,972 --> 01:39:33,308
all your actions up to now
have been pardoned.

995
01:39:33,825 --> 01:39:36,236
Breaking the jutsu
for the Infinite Tsukuyomi

996
01:39:36,261 --> 01:39:38,889
played a big part in the decision.

997
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:42,225
As well as the fact that I happened
to become the Sixth Hokage,

998
01:39:42,484 --> 01:39:45,829
and that Naruto,
the key figure in ending the war,

999
01:39:45,854 --> 01:39:48,148
testified on your behalf.

1000
01:39:48,273 --> 01:39:50,025
Don't forget that.

1001
01:39:50,442 --> 01:39:52,778
And please don't get too reckless.

1002
01:39:53,153 --> 01:39:55,239
Otherwise, I'll be held responsible.

1003
01:39:55,906 --> 01:39:57,866
Understood. Thank you.

1004
01:39:58,909 --> 01:40:01,078
Must you go?

1005
01:40:01,561 --> 01:40:04,230
The artificial arm that
Lady Tsunade is creating

1006
01:40:04,255 --> 01:40:06,076
from Lord Hashirama's cells will soon...

1007
01:40:06,726 --> 01:40:09,601
I need time to understand
my feelings.

1008
01:40:10,461 --> 01:40:13,486
How I should view the shinobi world,
this world.

1009
01:40:14,449 --> 01:40:17,535
Perhaps I'll be able to see things
I couldn't see before.

1010
01:40:18,095 --> 01:40:20,556
Things that can't be seen
unless I do this.

1011
01:40:21,290 --> 01:40:24,107
Also, there's something
I'm worried about.

1012
01:40:28,847 --> 01:40:33,310
What if I said... I'd go with you?

1013
01:40:39,733 --> 01:40:41,610
This is a trip to atone for my sins.

1014
01:40:42,494 --> 01:40:45,497
My sins have
nothing to do with you.

1015
01:40:47,908 --> 01:40:49,934
Nothing to do with me...?

1016
01:40:56,508 --> 01:40:58,135
Maybe next time.

1017
01:40:59,870 --> 01:41:00,871
Thank you.

1018
01:41:28,332 --> 01:41:31,627
I didn't think
you'd come to see me off.

1019
01:41:34,229 --> 01:41:35,138
Here.

1020
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:40,886
You kept that thing?

1021
01:41:43,872 --> 01:41:46,917
<i>You sacrificed your arm to stop me.</i>

1022
01:41:48,685 --> 01:41:51,313
<i>Thanks to you, I was saved.</i>

1023
01:41:52,723 --> 01:41:55,475
<i>Once, all we did was clash
with each other.</i>

1024
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:58,628
<i>But now, we share each other's pain.</i>

1025
01:41:59,363 --> 01:42:03,992
<i>After all my travels through the
world, I came to the conclusion</i>

1026
01:42:04,652 --> 01:42:07,321
<i>that this sharing of pain</i>

1027
01:42:07,538 --> 01:42:10,999
<i>can perhaps be applied to something
much bigger than just us.</i>

1028
01:42:12,084 --> 01:42:15,921
<i>But I can't do things like you.</i>

1029
01:42:16,088 --> 01:42:18,006
<i>Things don't go that smoothly,</i>

1030
01:42:18,856 --> 01:42:21,234
<i>as you and I know more than anyone...</i>

1031
01:42:21,468 --> 01:42:24,096
<i>The larger the world, the harder it is.</i>

1032
01:42:26,557 --> 01:42:28,725
I'm returning this.

1033
01:42:29,434 --> 01:42:31,895
I'll hang on to it...

1034
01:42:35,065 --> 01:42:36,650
... until our real match.

1035
01:42:37,734 --> 01:42:39,820
<i>This idea is almost a prayer.</i>

1036
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:44,116
<i>To keep enduring, no matter what,
until things come to pass.</i>

1037
01:42:44,199 --> 01:42:46,778
