1
00:00:16,944 --> 00:00:18,613
This is amazing.

2
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,062
Follow me.

3
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,914
These ruins seem to
be quite old.

4
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:43,084
They must have
archeological importance,

5
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,586
they should be restored.

6
00:00:44,777 --> 00:00:50,158
No! Those stone statues were carved
without heads to begin with.

7
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:52,260
There's a reason for it.

8
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,182
How am I supposed to
fight the Nine-Tails here?

9
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:59,826
What's more, how am I
supposed to face him?

10
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,604
I hope you're not going to
do anything excessive!

11
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,397
Do you think it's something
that can be controlled

12
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,607
without going overboard?

13
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,259
Fool, ya fool.

14
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,111
Since long ago,
this has been a sacred place

15
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,863
where those selected as
Jinchuriki have come

16
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,990
to undergo
the Purification Ceremony.

17
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:20,080
It's set up here so you can talk to
your Tailed Beast in a special way.

18
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:23,166
It's right inside this building.
You hear what I say?

19
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:25,627
This is...

20
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,881
Only the chosen ones can enter...
To be selected.

21
00:01:30,165 --> 00:01:32,834
In the statue's mouth... do as directed!

22
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,010
Like a man who's respected.

23
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:37,055
If your heart has no darkness inside,
the door will...

24
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,264
swing wide.

25
00:01:38,481 --> 00:01:42,235
Hey, can you explain it normally?

26
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:43,937
I don't quite understand.

27
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,481
No darkness in the heart?

28
00:01:47,624 --> 00:01:51,044
I see, so that's why
at the waterfall...

29
00:01:58,509 --> 00:01:59,510
However...

30
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:03,823
If there's even a little darkness
in your heart, the gate will not part.

31
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,083
Let's start.

32
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,795
And the statue will bite off
your head and tear you apart.

33
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,071
Be smart.

34
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,274
All the headless statues
you saw on your way here...

35
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:16,302
are past Jinchuriki who weren't...
sincere!

36
00:02:20,565 --> 00:02:21,816
This is too risky.

37
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,353
Naruto, use a shadow clone.

38
00:02:25,644 --> 00:02:28,980
This is a sacred place,
fool, ya fool.

39
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,860
Generations of Hidden Cloud
ancestors guard

40
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,319
and protect this place.

41
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,613
Tricks like that won't work!

42
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:36,489
But...

43
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,699
Captain Yamato...

44
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:42,745
I came here to learn how
to control the Nine-Tails' power!

45
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:47,917
This is important to me.
I can't run away!

46
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:00,346
<i>I'm going to believe in myself!</i>

47
00:03:11,249 --> 00:03:12,250
Naruto!

48
00:03:17,422 --> 00:03:20,299
No! How could this happen!

49
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:21,910
Naruto!

50
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:23,620
You...

51
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,372
Just kidding!

52
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,458
There's just a switch in there.

53
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:32,962
It's a habit.
I couldn't help myself.

54
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,381
I did the same thing too.
Out of habit.

55
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:38,134
Those stone statues are
just broken. Just a bit of wit.

56
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:42,972
I thought you said this place
was sacred! Fool, ya fool!

57
00:03:53,649 --> 00:03:54,775
This is...?

58
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:00,540
Go inside,
close your eyes and focus.

59
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:05,745
Just like at the waterfall.
Then you'll meet your Tailed Beast.

60
00:04:06,004 --> 00:04:08,640
Before when I was training,

61
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:12,627
I was able to meet
the Nine-Tails in my mind.

62
00:04:12,702 --> 00:04:15,788
Any Jinchuriki can do that.

63
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:20,093
But this is
a little different, okay?

64
00:04:30,736 --> 00:04:32,497
Listen to me very carefully.

65
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,690
I'll give you an explanation.

66
00:04:34,055 --> 00:04:38,185
Naruto, what kind of sealing jutsu
holds your Nine-Tails?

67
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,253
Please answer my question.

68
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,447
It's a Tetragram Seal.

69
00:04:41,706 --> 00:04:45,626
A Tetragram Seal, huh.
That's impressive.

70
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,746
It's even more solid than
my Steel Shell Seal.

71
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,832
Do you have the key?

72
00:04:50,973 --> 00:04:51,974
Yes!

73
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:53,827
You're going to undo
the seal, after all.

74
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:57,405
What if he can't
control it properly?

75
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,917
What if the Nine-Tails
revives completely?

76
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:03,669
We'll seal him away here.

77
00:05:04,112 --> 00:05:06,114
That's what this place
is for as well.

78
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:11,728
Until we get a new Jinchuriki,
this is where we'll seal him in.

79
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:13,855
You got a problem with this?
No booin'.

80
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,940
– But...
– That won't happen!

81
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,235
Because I'm going to do this.

82
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,740
Okay! I'm going to shut the door.

83
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,909
And I'll show you how to deal
with the Nine-Tails!

84
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,595
<i>Naruto, you really do impress me.</i>

85
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,347
<i>The rules are simple,
as you'll soon see.</i>

86
00:05:48,055 --> 00:05:51,792
<i>Greet the Nine-Tails in your
subconscious mind, then undo the seal.</i>

87
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:58,358
Hey, evil glare as usual.

88
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,526
<i>Naruto...</i>

89
00:06:01,377 --> 00:06:02,878
<i>You...</i>

90
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,034
What is it?

91
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,662
<i>Where'd the real you go?</i>

92
00:06:12,196 --> 00:06:13,822
<i>I don't sense him.</i>

93
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:18,586
I'm here... right in front of you!

94
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,258
<i>You conquered hatred.</i>

95
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,187
<i>But don't relax,
do the best you can!</i>

96
00:06:28,496 --> 00:06:30,331
<i>The Nine-Tails is
a mass of true hatred.</i>

97
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,599
<i>That's absolutely true, man!</i>

98
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,696
<i>What are you up to?</i>

99
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:49,050
Can't you see my mouth is full?

100
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,791
<i>Here I go...</i>

101
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,235
<i>When the Nine-Tails emerges
from the seal,</i>

102
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:27,864
<i>grab the Nine-Tails' chakra with
your own chakra, and pull it away!</i>

103
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,535
<i>Chakra can only be caught
with chakra.</i>

104
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,828
<i>It's common sense, son.</i>

105
00:07:34,178 --> 00:07:37,056
<i>Take the Nine-Tails' chakra
away from him...</i>

106
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,333
<i>and you'll be number one.</i>

107
00:07:47,658 --> 00:07:49,243
<i>Touch the Nine-Tails directly and</i>

108
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:52,980
<i>stick your chakra onto its chakra,
and it'll pull each other.</i>

109
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:57,226
<i>In other words, it's going to be
like a match of tug-of-war. Okay?!</i>

110
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,693
<i>I'll help you in your fight.</i>

111
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:11,032
<i>But unfortunately inside
your head I got no might.</i>

112
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,076
He's strong!

113
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:14,110
<i>Just a word of warning.</i>

114
00:08:14,135 --> 00:08:15,761
<i>When you're trying to
take his chakra,</i>

115
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,955
<i>there's the risk that
he'll pull away yours.</i>

116
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,835
<i>I don't need to explain what'll
happen if all your chakra is</i>

117
00:08:22,927 --> 00:08:25,221
<i>pulled away and
you have zero left, right?</i>

118
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:30,718
<i>I see. You intend to
control my power.</i>

119
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,554
<i>So you teamed up
with Eight-Tails?</i>

120
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:37,183
<i>You, the Jinchuriki of
the Nine-Tails? That's pitiful!</i>

121
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,485
<i>The risks are high for sure.</i>

122
00:08:47,835 --> 00:08:52,031
<i>But if you take it away, the Nine
Tails' chakra will be yours forever!</i>

123
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,993
<i>Grab whatever chakra you can
from the Nine-Tails' will...</i>

124
00:08:56,018 --> 00:08:57,353
<i>That's the deal!</i>

125
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,666
<i>Don't get caught in
the Nine-Tails' hatred.</i>

126
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,961
<i>Use your strong will.
That's how you'll ward him off!</i>

127
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,555
Don't underestimate me!

128
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,562
<i>Thank you, Octopops!</i>

129
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,570
I managed to contain the explosion!

130
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:33,364
Naruto, that will be the last of
my cooperation to your operation!

131
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,157
<i>Thanks!</i>

132
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,494
<i>I'm sitting still
just as I thought.</i>

133
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:46,335
<i>Sage Art: Super Giant Rasengan!</i>

134
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:00,933
<i>So fast!</i>

135
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,357
<i>Do you think you can beat me?</i>

136
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,361
Why would I break
the seal otherwise?

137
00:10:12,494 --> 00:10:13,495
Besides...

138
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,531
We gotcha!

139
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,255
<i>Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken!</i>

140
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,052
Do it now!

141
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,824
<i>He's weakening!
Now's my chance.</i>

142
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,421
<i>Hatred...</i>

143
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:14,189
<i>Suffering...</i>

144
00:11:14,631 --> 00:11:16,425
<i>I want to kill...</i>

145
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,844
<i>Help!</i>

146
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,014
<i>I hate all this!</i>

147
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,892
<i>It's not going to work anyway.</i>

148
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,727
<i>I'll get revenge!</i>

149
00:11:29,972 --> 00:11:31,849
What is this?

150
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:38,781
<i>This is bad!</i>

151
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:42,827
<i>Don't give in, Naruto!
Fool, ya fool!</i>

152
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:54,130
<i>You cannot control my power!</i>

153
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,758
<i>You are just a small portion
of my hatred!</i>

154
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,720
<i>Is he the one?</i>

155
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,055
<i>Get lost!</i>

156
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,892
<i>No one will ever respect
someone like you!</i>

157
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,519
<i>Get lost!</i>

158
00:12:08,653 --> 00:12:09,820
<i>Get lost!</i>

159
00:12:09,845 --> 00:12:11,930
<i>Get lost! Get lost!</i>

160
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:13,482
<i>Just go away!</i>

161
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,025
Shut up!

162
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,574
The Nine-Tails' hatred is greater
than I imagined.

163
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:25,119
This could get bad for real.
This is quite an ordeal!

164
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,370
I'll stop him.

165
00:12:28,138 --> 00:12:30,599
<i>Go away and disappear!</i>

166
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:35,254
<i>It's all right,
you can stay right here.</i>

167
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,680
Naruto...

168
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,066
Naruto...

169
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,278
What? What are you doing here?

170
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,656
And how come you know my name?

171
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,118
Oh yes, that's right.

172
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:34,206
Well then, Naruto,
can you guess who I am?

173
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:45,926
No way...

174
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,262
Have you figured it out?

175
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:51,390
You're Nine-Tails' real form!

176
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,230
That's such a crude laugh!

177
00:14:58,414 --> 00:15:02,026
You're trying to fool me by transforming
yourself into a woman, Nine-Tails?

178
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,193
You got it wrong, ya know!

179
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,029
Ouch!

180
00:15:06,237 --> 00:15:08,073
Huh? "Ya know"?

181
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,744
I couldn't stop myself
from hitting you.

182
00:15:12,795 --> 00:15:15,172
I was born impatient,
and I talk fast,

183
00:15:15,197 --> 00:15:17,366
so I use some weird phrases.

184
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:21,420
I try to control it,
but it slips out when I get excited.

185
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,006
What about you?

186
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:28,135
I hope you didn't get any of
my bad speech patterns.

187
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,304
Then...

188
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,557
Minato, didn't say anything to you?

189
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,393
Shame on him.

190
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,049
Yes... I'm...

191
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,493
I've wanted...

192
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:58,499
I've wanted to meet you
for so long, Mom... ya know?

193
00:15:59,533 --> 00:16:01,117
"Ya know," huh?

194
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,046
You really are my child.

195
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,886
<i>The Nine-Tails transformation stopped.</i>

196
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,847
Did you do something, Yamato?

197
00:16:14,256 --> 00:16:17,092
No, it seems to have
stopped on its own.

198
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,478
<i>What happened?</i>

199
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:25,376
There's a ton of stuff

200
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,695
I wanted to ask you
when I met you!

201
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,906
Sure, you can ask me anything.

202
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,493
But first, we have to tame
the Nine-Tails.

203
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,591
<i>This chakra...</i>

204
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,593
<i>Kushina, is that you?</i>

205
00:16:53,253 --> 00:16:56,298
Minato embedded my chakra
into the seal formula,

206
00:16:56,323 --> 00:16:59,618
so that when the time came
for you to take control

207
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:03,856
of the Nine-Tails' power,
I could be of help.

208
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,443
Are you listening?

209
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,738
I'm glad my Mom is so beautiful!

210
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,406
Well, thank you!

211
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,702
Your hair is just like your father's,

212
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:20,205
but I'm sorry you inherited
my looks, Naruto.

213
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:21,874
Why?

214
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:24,059
If I got my pretty mom's looks,

215
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:26,211
that makes me handsome, right?

216
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:31,341
And you have nice,
straight red hair.

217
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,635
I wish my hair were like that too!

218
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:41,769
You're the second man to
compliment my red hair.

219
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,397
Really? Who was the first?

220
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,778
Who else? Your father.

221
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,989
Oh! That's right!

222
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:55,741
What is it?

223
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,417
Hey, hey!

224
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:01,706
I always wanted to ask you
one thing if I ever met you!

225
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:05,501
How did you and Dad
fall in love?

226
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,422
What an embarrassing thing
to ask, ya know!

227
00:18:10,505 --> 00:18:12,674
Hey! You said, "ya know!"

228
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,551
You're excited!

229
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:17,930
In this case, it's more like
shaken up, ya know!

230
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,556
Hey, you said it again!

231
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,479
Let's see...

232
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:30,818
<i>It was the first day I came
to the Hidden Leaf Village...</i>

233
00:18:38,133 --> 00:18:42,595
<i>That's when I first met
your father, Minato.</i>

234
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:46,357
All right. We have a new transfer student
today who will be attending our Academy.

235
00:18:46,383 --> 00:18:48,427
I'm Kushina Uzumaki, ya know!

236
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,003
Oh!

237
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,756
Look at the color of her hair.

238
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,258
How can anyone have
hair like that?

239
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,427
How do you get it that red?

240
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,012
Her hair's really weird!

241
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,933
– I wouldn't go out with hair like that.
– Hey! Be quiet! Settle down!

242
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,519
I'm...

243
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:10,315
I'm going to become
the village's first female Hokage!

244
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,866
I want to become a great Hokage

245
00:19:19,082 --> 00:19:21,168
who will be admired by everyone
in the village too!

246
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:29,376
A Hokage who is admired
by everyone in the village, huh.

247
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:34,798
Back then, he wasn't very manly
and didn't look too dependable.

248
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,092
So I didn't take Minato seriously

249
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,761
or believe for a minute that
he could become a Hokage.

250
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:43,599
Why not? Dad looked so strong.

251
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,434
You're right.

252
00:19:46,126 --> 00:19:49,754
But back then,
I was young and very ignorant.

253
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,696
But I sure was arrogant,
having moved from another village

254
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,824
and announcing that I was going
to become the Hokage.

255
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,703
After that, I started getting
teased by the boys.

256
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,497
They nicknamed me...

257
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:08,916
Tomato!

258
00:20:09,182 --> 00:20:11,226
From today, we're going
to call you Tomato!

259
00:20:11,401 --> 00:20:14,195
You have a fat, round face
with red hair.

260
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,881
Just like a tomato!

261
00:20:16,113 --> 00:20:18,240
As if a tomato can become
the Hokage!

262
00:20:18,274 --> 00:20:20,319
I hate tomatoes!

263
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,261
Me too!

264
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,222
I never eat it in my salad!

265
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,224
A tomato that everyone hates

266
00:20:25,249 --> 00:20:27,710
could never be accepted
as the Hokage!

267
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,441
So that's it!

268
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:40,130
I'll bet it was Dad who
protected you from those bullies!

269
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,408
No, you're dead wrong!

270
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,428
<i>Tomato...</i>

271
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,914
<i>I grudgingly accepted being
called that name.</i>

272
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:51,208
<i>It was embarrassing,
but it fit me perfectly.</i>

273
00:20:51,741 --> 00:20:54,236
You're getting redder and riper!

274
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:58,323
It's the Tomato Festival!
It's time to harvest!

275
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,092
Who are you calling Tomato?

276
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:04,504
Now you listen...
I hate tomatoes too, ya know!

277
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,644
Keep calling me Tomato

278
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,063
and you're going to get it,
ya know!

279
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:17,025
What are you laughing at?

280
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:24,366
I always beat those bullies
at their own game

281
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,460
and turned them into
smashed tomatoes.

282
00:21:29,897 --> 00:21:34,318
The girl with the long red hair
who beat the boys half to death.

283
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,629
As expected,
I was stuck with a new nickname...

284
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:43,010
The Red-Hot Habanero!

285
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,662
<i>Kiba and Shikamaru were
always saying</i>

286
00:21:46,687 --> 00:21:49,106
<i>that mothers are really scary.</i>

287
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,353
Always fighting.

288
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:57,607
Naturally, I always won these fights
as the Red-Hot Habanero.

289
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,276
But...

290
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:03,113
I used to hate my hair.

291
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:12,456
But a certain incident changed
the way I felt about my red hair.

292
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,925
A certain incident?

293
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,504
I'm home!

294
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,175
I'm home.

295
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,260
Is...

296
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,555
Is anyone home?

297
00:22:50,093 --> 00:22:51,302
Someone!

298
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:52,829
Help me!

299
00:22:58,192 --> 00:23:01,111
<i>I have a special kind of chakra.</i>

300
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:06,093
<i>Because of that,
the Hidden Cloud kidnapped me.</i>

301
00:23:07,443 --> 00:23:10,530
<i>At that time, in order to
leave a trail behind</i>

302
00:23:11,006 --> 00:23:13,217
<i>as I was being taken away,</i>

303
00:23:13,242 --> 00:23:16,787
<i>I cut off pieces of my hair
and dropped it...</i>

304
00:23:17,003 --> 00:23:19,005
<i>without the enemy knowing.</i>

305
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:23,869
<i>But since I was an outsider,</i>

306
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:28,615
<i>I didn't hold out hope that
anyone would come to rescue me.</i>

307
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,743
<i>We had come to the edge
of the border</i>

308
00:23:31,985 --> 00:23:34,112
<i>and I thought it was all over...</i>

309
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,440
I came to save you.

310
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,325
You'll be all right now.

311
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,245
Hey, wait a minute!

312
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:25,771
That's...

313
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,010
Your hair is beautiful.
So I noticed it right away.

314
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,389
But you've always ignored me.

315
00:24:34,989 --> 00:24:39,452
Because I know that
you're strong,

316
00:24:40,327 --> 00:24:42,830
in body and in spirit.

317
00:24:45,133 --> 00:24:48,011
But this is a fight between
two villages.

318
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:51,865
It's different from
your other fights, so...

319
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:53,617
So?

320
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,287
I didn't want to lose you.

321
00:25:01,716 --> 00:25:03,385
Even if I'm an outsider?

322
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,378
Why do you say that?

323
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:09,674
You live in Hidden Leaf Village.
so you're one of us.

324
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,677
<i>At that moment,</i>

325
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,638
<i>Minato was a great ninja
in my eyes.</i>

326
00:25:15,272 --> 00:25:18,233
<i>He was the man of my dreams.</i>

327
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,644
<i>He changed me.</i>

328
00:25:20,869 --> 00:25:23,872
<i>This red hair that I used to hate</i>

329
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:27,359
<i>brought me
the man of my destiny.</i>

330
00:25:28,118 --> 00:25:30,745
<i>And it became
the "red thread of fate."</i>

331
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,449
<i>After that, I learned to
love my hair.</i>

332
00:25:34,565 --> 00:25:35,817
<i>And...</i>

333
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:38,828
<i>I fell in love with Minato.</i>

334
00:25:43,492 --> 00:25:46,044
Only men who compliment my hair

335
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:49,522
get to hear these precious words
from me.

336
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,342
Naruto, will you accept them?

337
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,094
Uh-huh!

338
00:25:58,682 --> 00:25:59,683
<i>I love you.</i>

339
00:26:01,066 --> 00:26:02,067
<i>What is this?</i>

340
00:26:04,628 --> 00:26:07,181
<i>I feel so calm...</i>

341
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,487
<i>I love you.</i>

342
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,115
<i>I feel so happy.</i>

343
00:26:16,983 --> 00:26:18,752
<i>Damn you, Kushina!</i>

344
00:26:26,101 --> 00:26:26,935
<i>What is this?</i>

345
00:26:27,161 --> 00:26:28,345
This is real nice!

346
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:29,829
For now,
keeping watch will suffice!

347
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:34,509
My chakra that's suppressing
the Nine-Tails won't last much longer!

348
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:37,153
This is your chance to do it!

349
00:26:38,128 --> 00:26:39,129
All right!

350
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,542
<i>Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

351
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:46,947
<i>You brat!</i>

352
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,947
Just as I thought.
He's really strong!

353
00:26:59,383 --> 00:27:00,468
Take this!

354
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,501
<i>Rasengan Super Barrage!</i>

355
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,713
<i>Don't underestimate me!</i>

356
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:15,050
I can keep going, ya know!

357
00:27:24,483 --> 00:27:25,484
Here!

358
00:27:26,127 --> 00:27:27,128
That's...

359
00:27:28,988 --> 00:27:30,155
Sage Mode!

360
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,160
<i>Sage Art!</i>

361
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,080
<i>Massive...</i>

362
00:27:45,846 --> 00:27:47,765
<i>Rasengan Barrage!</i>

363
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,930
One more round!

364
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,813
<i>What kind of power is this?</i>

365
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,152
Pull!

366
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,989
Get out!

367
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:25,495
You did it! You pulled
the Nine-Tails' chakra out!

368
00:28:49,819 --> 00:28:50,820
This is...

369
00:28:51,904 --> 00:28:53,781
This is the Nine-Tails'...

370
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,859
<i>Naruto...</i>

371
00:28:56,851 --> 00:28:58,269
<i>You...</i>

372
00:28:59,945 --> 00:29:04,491
<i>You have infuriated me, Naruto!</i>

373
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,998
You still have that much power...

374
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,214
You really are amazing.

375
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,517
<i>This is the Six Paths...?!</i>

376
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:44,866
<i>You watch out, Naruto.</i>

377
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:49,120
<i>I'm sorry... Nine-Tails.</i>

378
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:54,918
<i>But I'll make it up to you.</i>

379
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,839
<i>So just hang in there
for a little while.</i>

380
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:07,472
You did it, Naruto!

381
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,183
Yeah.

382
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,272
Mom, where are you going now?

383
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,275
I can finally go and join Minato.

384
00:30:29,502 --> 00:30:33,547
There's something
I must tell you before I go.

385
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:36,751
Naruto...

386
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,537
It's about when you were born
16 years ago.

387
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,756
I'll tell you what really happened.

388
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:46,052
What really happened...
16 years ago?

389
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:52,976
I was the Nine-Tails' Jinchuriki
before you were.

390
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,354
Let's start from there.

391
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:01,901
You were the Nine-Tails' Jinchuriki, Mom?

392
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:06,406
I was chosen as the second
Jinchuriki host of Nine-Tails.

393
00:31:07,247 --> 00:31:10,501
Truth be told, I was brought here for
the express purpose

394
00:31:10,534 --> 00:31:12,161
of being the Nine-Tails' Jinchuriki...

395
00:31:13,211 --> 00:31:15,149
from the Land of Whirlpools.

396
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:16,916
Why?

397
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:22,213
Why did they have to choose
someone from another land?!

398
00:31:23,932 --> 00:31:27,477
You're right. I'm from
a different land, and village.

399
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,721
But the Land of Fire and
the Land of Whirlpools,

400
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:33,825
as well as Hidden Leaf Village
and Hidden Whirlpool Village,

401
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,768
share a deep bond.

402
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,730
The shinobi of the Senju Clan
of the Hidden Leaf

403
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:40,982
and the shinobi of the Uzumaki Clan
of the Hidden Whirlpool

404
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,901
were distant blood relatives.

405
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,738
Our people lived long.

406
00:31:47,021 --> 00:31:50,733
So the Hidden Whirlpool Village was
also known as the Village of Longevity.

407
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:57,665
And we specialized in sealing jutsu.

408
00:32:00,635 --> 00:32:01,886
We were also a rowdy bunch.

409
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:06,758
The Tetragram Seal on
your abdomen is based

410
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,052
on a jutsu from our village.

411
00:32:09,944 --> 00:32:15,116
And Minato, your father, learned
various sealing jutsu from my mother.

412
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,687
Naruto, the symbol on your back...

413
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,775
That is the symbol
of the Hidden Whirlpool.

414
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,902
Even today in Hidden Leaf Village

415
00:32:26,927 --> 00:32:30,639
that symbol is a symbol
of friendship, isn't it?

416
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,370
So the Hidden Whirlpool Village...?

417
00:32:37,838 --> 00:32:40,924
It no longer exists.

418
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:46,255
During the era of war, our sealing
jutsu abilities were greatly feared,

419
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:49,008
so the village was targeted
and destroyed.

420
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:52,136
Those who survived feared
for their safety,

421
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:54,806
so they hid their identities and
scattered throughout the region.

422
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:58,559
But still... why were you chosen?!

423
00:32:59,786 --> 00:33:01,871
It seems that even within my village,

424
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:06,901
I was born with powerful chakra
able to suppress the Nine-Tails.

425
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:12,715
Do you know about the battle...

426
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:16,619
between the First Hokage,
Hashirama Senju, and Madara Uchiha?

427
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:18,746
Mm-hm.

428
00:33:19,905 --> 00:33:22,908
The Jinchuriki who came before me...

429
00:33:22,941 --> 00:33:25,235
was the First Hokage's wife.

430
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,840
Her name was Mito Uzumaki.

431
00:33:30,233 --> 00:33:31,776
In order to help Lord First Hokage

432
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:35,096
who had obtained the Nine-Tails
in his battle with Madara,

433
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,484
Lady Mito sealed the Nine-Tails
inside her body

434
00:33:39,841 --> 00:33:42,094
with a Sealing Jutsu and
became its Jinchuriki.

435
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:46,899
From then on, the Hidden Leaf
maintained possession of the Nine-Tails.

436
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,622
But when Lady Mito's days
were coming to an end,

437
00:33:53,214 --> 00:33:57,760
I was brought to Hidden Leaf
as the vessel for the Nine-Tails.

438
00:33:58,468 --> 00:34:01,278
They just used you!

439
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:08,129
When I was first brought to the village,
I wasn't told a thing.

440
00:34:08,897 --> 00:34:11,608
It was quite a shock
when I was told why I was there.

441
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,387
This was a closely guarded secret.

442
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,306
And the only ones who knew

443
00:34:18,331 --> 00:34:21,251
were the Third Hokage and
a few of the top officials.

444
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,270
Not even the Legendary Sannin
were told about this.

445
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:29,484
I was nearly overwhelmed by
the pressure of being the Jinchuriki

446
00:34:29,509 --> 00:34:31,219
and the loneliness I felt.

447
00:34:33,878 --> 00:34:37,549
But Lady Mito, the previous Jinchuriki,
summoned me...

448
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:42,330
Like you, I was brought here

449
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,665
to become the vessel
for the Nine-Tails.

450
00:34:45,065 --> 00:34:48,194
I can imagine your shock
when you learned of this.

451
00:34:48,694 --> 00:34:50,613
How sad you must have been.

452
00:34:51,238 --> 00:34:53,240
How you have suffered.

453
00:34:55,484 --> 00:34:59,363
You can tell me the truth.

454
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,142
Yes...

455
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:07,730
Now listen carefully.

456
00:35:07,964 --> 00:35:11,259
It's true, we are the vessels
for the Nine-Tails.

457
00:35:11,612 --> 00:35:16,964
However, there is a way
to find happiness

458
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:20,326
even if you must live as a Jinchuriki.

459
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,823
First...

460
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,416
we must fill ourselves up.

461
00:35:29,769 --> 00:35:33,439
If I filled myself with love first,

462
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:38,344
I would be able to live a happy life

463
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:42,014
despite being
the Nine-Tails' Jinchuriki.

464
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:45,059
That is what Lady Mito taught me.

465
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:49,521
So you were happy even as
a Jinchuriki, Mom?

466
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,109
Yes.

467
00:36:01,542 --> 00:36:04,337
Naruto... Now why are you crying?

468
00:36:07,581 --> 00:36:08,406
Wait...

469
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:09,876
What is it?

470
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,587
That time 16 years ago

471
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,047
when the Nine-Tails attacked
Hidden Leaf Village...

472
00:36:15,581 --> 00:36:21,012
Dad said a man wearing
an Akatsuki mask was behind it.

473
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:25,766
So how come you had
the Nine-Tails, Mom?

474
00:36:26,742 --> 00:36:29,870
I see that your father didn't
tell you all the details.

475
00:36:31,471 --> 00:36:32,681
Of course.

476
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:37,195
Back then,
there was so much going on

477
00:36:37,578 --> 00:36:40,205
and Minato didn't have much time.

478
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,661
It's true. The fact is that,
16 years ago,

479
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,330
a masked man controlled

480
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,916
the Nine-Tails to
attack the village.

481
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,418
But moments earlier,

482
00:36:52,676 --> 00:36:55,387
I had the Nine-Tails sealed
and in my possession.

483
00:36:55,687 --> 00:36:57,356
Then why?

484
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,342
That masked man...

485
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,412
He knew about the one chance
he had to weaken the seal,

486
00:37:03,437 --> 00:37:05,815
which kept the Tailed Beast
locked inside the Jinchuriki.

487
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:09,435
He waited for that moment
to steal the Nine-Tails.

488
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:12,762
The one chance to weaken the seal?!

489
00:37:13,513 --> 00:37:15,307
What was it?

490
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,227
It was childbirth.

491
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,990
During the approximately
ten months from the time

492
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:26,118
a female Jinchuriki gets pregnant
and gives birth,

493
00:37:26,678 --> 00:37:29,764
the Tailed Beast Seal
weakens proportionally

494
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,750
as the energy normally
used to maintain the seal

495
00:37:32,892 --> 00:37:36,228
is diverted to the growing baby.

496
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:38,547
Then...

497
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:43,636
Sixteen years ago... on October 10...

498
00:37:45,395 --> 00:37:49,566
Kushina, there is something
I must explain to you

499
00:37:49,591 --> 00:37:52,093
about giving birth.

500
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,314
It happened to Lady Mito,
the previous Jinchuriki, as well.

501
00:37:55,764 --> 00:37:59,810
During her labor,
the Nine-Tails' seal was nearly broken.

502
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,964
I'm sorry,
but as a precautionary measure,

503
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:05,049
we're going to ask you
to deliver the child

504
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:08,119
somewhere away from the village,
inside a barrier.

505
00:38:09,394 --> 00:38:13,273
We have the seal to think of,
so I will be accompanying you.

506
00:38:15,485 --> 00:38:17,803
Minato and Taji from
the ANBU Black Ops.

507
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:21,165
Also, I will send my wife, Biwako,
to be with you.

508
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,427
This is to be done in utmost secrecy.

509
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,015
Naturally, I will assign bodyguards,

510
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:31,726
but they will be ANBU Black Ops
under my direct orders.

511
00:38:36,413 --> 00:38:38,457
I'll go on ahead and
prepare everything.

512
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,319
All right.

513
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,572
I will take you there.

514
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,200
Kushina!

515
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:50,077
Oh, yes.

516
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:52,621
I appreciate it.

517
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:57,543
We should go soon.

518
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:58,919
Yes.

519
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:07,678
Oh!

520
00:39:10,889 --> 00:39:12,099
Oh my...

521
00:39:13,033 --> 00:39:14,452
Is it a girl?

522
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:16,995
It's a boy.

523
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:19,373
So cute...

524
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,859
What's your name?

525
00:39:23,009 --> 00:39:24,261
It's Sasuke.

526
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:28,991
Oh, so he was named after
the Third Hokage's father!

527
00:39:29,458 --> 00:39:32,836
Yes, so that he will grow up
to be a strong and fine shinobi.

528
00:39:34,471 --> 00:39:36,473
You will be giving birth
soon too, right, Kushina?

529
00:39:37,148 --> 00:39:39,776
You should pick a name
in advance.

530
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,504
I already have.

531
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:43,839
His name will be Naruto.

532
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:48,427
You'll be classmates, Sasuke,
so be friends, okay?

533
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:52,598
By the way, does it really hurt?

534
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:57,311
So there's actually something
that scares you, Kushina!

535
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,105
I'm surprised!

536
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,482
Let's go, Kushina!

537
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,442
Oh, yes!

538
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:04,819
See you again!

539
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:08,781
The details of your birthing
are supposed to be top secret.

540
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:13,536
Until we get to our location, you must
avoid any contact, even with your friends.

541
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:16,205
Yes, I'm sorry.

542
00:40:17,489 --> 00:40:21,861
Also, we are leaving
the village secretly.

543
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:25,297
If your labor pains begin,
try not to cry out loud!

544
00:40:25,739 --> 00:40:27,282
Oh... right.

545
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:32,763
It hurts, ya know!

546
00:40:40,103 --> 00:40:44,816
I've never seen Kushina
in so much pain.

547
00:40:45,084 --> 00:40:47,837
Is she... all right?

548
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:49,738
She's all right!

549
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:51,424
Never mind that.

550
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,410
Just stay focused
on the Nine-Tails' seal!

551
00:40:56,395 --> 00:40:58,481
But she's...

552
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:02,503
You are the Fourth Hokage!
Act like one!

553
00:41:03,001 --> 00:41:05,670
A man would have dropped dead
from such pain long ago.

554
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:08,424
But women are strong!

555
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:20,193
<i>He's so strong!</i>

556
00:41:20,218 --> 00:41:22,387
<i>The Nine-Tails is struggling
to get out!</i>

557
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,483
Hang in there, Kushina!

558
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,360
Hang in there, Naruto!

559
00:42:04,905 --> 00:42:08,232
I can see his head!
You're almost there, Kushina!

560
00:42:08,757 --> 00:42:10,678
Hang on, Kushina!

561
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,701
Naruto! Come out quickly!

562
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:20,621
Nine-Tails, you stay put!

563
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:32,716
Hot water!

564
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:33,875
Right!

565
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,649
He's born!

566
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,870
I'm a father today!

567
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,374
He's a healthy baby boy.

568
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,002
Naruto!

569
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,587
Don't touch him!

570
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,673
The mother sees him first.

571
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:21,223
Naruto...

572
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:25,352
I finally get to see you.

573
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,273
You'll have lots more time later.

574
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,568
There, there.

575
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:41,118
How are you feeling, Kushina?

576
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,329
Okay.

577
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:46,540
Thank you.

578
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,501
Minato...

579
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:52,421
All right!

580
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:54,982
I know you've gone
through childbirth,

581
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,276
but I'm going to completely
seal the Nine-Tails!

582
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:01,472
Lady Biwako!

583
00:44:01,497 --> 00:44:02,498
Taji!

584
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:07,811
Fourth Hokage Minato,
get away from the Jinchuriki.

585
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:14,068
Otherwise, this child's life
will end in one minute.

586
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:18,572
<i>How did he get past the barrier?</i>

587
00:44:20,049 --> 00:44:21,425
<i>This guy...</i>

588
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,077
<i>Who the hell is he?</i>

589
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,331
Kushina!

590
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,625
<i>The Nine-Tails Seal is still...</i>

591
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:33,170
Get away from the Jinchuriki.

592
00:44:33,595 --> 00:44:35,430
Don't you care
what happens to your kid?

593
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:38,509
Wait! Calm down!

594
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:41,094
Speak for yourself, Minato.

595
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:43,806
I'm as cool as can be.

596
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:45,432
Naruto!

597
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:58,112
Well, I must hand it to
the Yellow Flash.

598
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:01,782
But I wonder about this next one.

599
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:05,828
Minato!

600
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:06,995
Naruto!

601
00:45:21,368 --> 00:45:24,371
Thank goodness...
Naruto isn't hurt.

602
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,521
<i>I was forced to use
the Flying Raijin Jutsu.</i>

603
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,024
<i>His target is Kushina...</i>

604
00:45:37,209 --> 00:45:38,669
<i>and he succeeded in separating us.</i>

605
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:41,196
<i>I must hurry.</i>

606
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:03,802
Just what... do you want?

607
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,432
I'm going to pull the Nine-Tails
out from you

608
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:09,941
and destroy the Hidden Leaf.

609
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,853
What?

610
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:18,217
Minato's Teleportation Jutsu
allows him to move instantly

611
00:46:18,533 --> 00:46:21,494
between locations marked
with jutsu Formulas.

612
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:26,533
He made sure to mark
your Sealing Formula too...

613
00:46:28,068 --> 00:46:30,445
in order to protect you.

614
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:32,998
However, I managed to put
a distance between you.

615
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:36,659
Furthermore, the Nine-Tails' Seal
has been weakened from childbirth.

616
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,007
Do you know how long
I've waited for this moment?

617
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,260
You'll be safe here.

618
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:49,848
Naruto, just wait awhile.

619
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:52,784
I have to go and save your mother.

620
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,655
<i>You are...</i>

621
00:47:40,766 --> 00:47:44,353
Now then, come out Nine-Tails!

622
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,012
Good.

623
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:13,515
Now I'll go straight
to Hidden Leaf Village.

624
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:16,727
Hold it.

625
00:48:17,303 --> 00:48:20,347
The Uzumaki Clan is amazing.

626
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:24,902
You don't die right away after
the Tailed Beast is extracted.

627
00:48:28,663 --> 00:48:31,541
You were the Jinchuriki
of the Nine-Tails.

628
00:48:35,103 --> 00:48:37,689
I'll use him to kill you.

629
00:48:48,901 --> 00:48:51,403
I must say,
you really live up to your nickname.

630
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:54,523
But you are too late.

631
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,225
Minato...

632
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:01,103
Is Naruto... Is he safe?

633
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:03,732
Yes, he's fine.

634
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:06,818
He's in a safe place for now.

635
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:08,779
Thank goodness.

636
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:15,994
Minato, you must stop that man
and the Nine-Tails right now.

637
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:19,790
He's heading for Hidden Leaf Village.

638
00:49:26,721 --> 00:49:27,722
Why?

639
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:29,257
Never mind that.

640
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:31,718
Just stay with Naruto.

641
00:49:41,735 --> 00:49:42,862
Naruto...

642
00:49:54,916 --> 00:49:57,419
Minato... Thank you.

643
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:00,122
Good luck.

644
00:50:03,158 --> 00:50:05,118
I'll be right back.

645
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,425
What is this feeling?

646
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:18,781
There, there...

647
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:21,017
<i>It's a strange feeling.</i>

648
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,921
<i>Of all times for Mom
and Dad to be out.</i>

649
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:27,983
Don't cry, Sasuke.

650
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:29,985
No matter what happens,

651
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,279
your big brother will
definitely protect you.

652
00:50:40,661 --> 00:50:42,288
<i>It can't be...</i>

653
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,673
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

654
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:07,647
– What happened?
– Is it an accident?

655
00:51:07,922 --> 00:51:09,090
That's...!

656
00:51:12,952 --> 00:51:15,246
N-No way...!

657
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:19,493
The Nine-Tails!

658
00:51:19,677 --> 00:51:21,053
– Run!
– It's the Nine-Tails!

659
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,412
– Help!
– We're done for!

660
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:24,372
Go, Nine-Tails!

661
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:46,520
<i>As Hokage,</i>

662
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:48,480
<i>I will protect the village,
my family, right now.</i>

663
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:51,858
<i>This is what I need to do.</i>

664
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,571
<i>I won't allow it to do
as it pleases anymore!</i>

665
00:52:02,227 --> 00:52:03,728
So you've taken notice of me.

666
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,335
You won't get your way here!

667
00:52:31,664 --> 00:52:33,124
<i>For this large a scale,</i>

668
00:52:33,432 --> 00:52:36,060
<i>I'll have to be careful
where I send it.</i>

669
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:38,738
The jutsu that stopped
the Nine-Tails' attack

670
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,832
must be the Teleportation Barrier!

671
00:52:41,073 --> 00:52:42,116
It's Minato?

672
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:44,452
All right! We're going too!

673
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:45,495
Right!

674
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:48,915
<i>I must report all that's happened
to Lord Third immediately.</i>

675
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:04,973
I'm your opponent...
and it's all over.

676
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:13,607
He flew away. He's fast.

677
00:53:15,166 --> 00:53:17,626
Next time, I'll get him faster.

678
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:20,746
The instant we make contact.

679
00:53:25,051 --> 00:53:27,220
<i>My attack missed.</i>

680
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:31,541
<i>But he materialized and
instantly tried to drag me in.</i>

681
00:53:32,383 --> 00:53:34,385
<i>What is that jutsu?</i>

682
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:42,928
I won't let you get away.

683
00:53:44,069 --> 00:53:46,655
<i>He uses the Teleportation Jutsu too?</i>

684
00:53:47,715 --> 00:53:50,968
<i>Is that how he took Kushina
and moved away so quickly?</i>

685
00:53:53,145 --> 00:53:56,023
<i>A shinobi who outmaneuvered the ANBU
assigned under Lord Third's direct control...</i>

686
00:53:56,048 --> 00:53:58,676
<i>who slipped through
a top-secret barrier...</i>

687
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:02,072
<i>and who knew that the Nine-Tails'
Seal would weaken during childbirth.</i>

688
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:08,954
<i>Furthermore, he undid the
Nine-Tails' Seal, controlled it and...</i>

689
00:54:10,238 --> 00:54:14,242
<i>went in and out of the barrier set up
by the Hidden Leaf without being caught.</i>

690
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:18,922
<i>I know of only one shinobi
capable of this.</i>

691
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:24,678
Are you Madara Uchiha?

692
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:31,559
No, that's impossible.

693
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:33,687
He's dead.

694
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:37,816
I wonder about that.

695
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:41,945
At this point,
it doesn't matter who you are.

696
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,080
But why are you targeting
the Hidden Leaf?

697
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:51,788
I could say I did it on a whim,
or that I planned it,

698
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,915
or that it's war,

699
00:54:54,524 --> 00:54:56,325
or that it's for peace.

700
00:54:59,578 --> 00:55:01,580
<i>Whatever the case,
he's no ordinary man!</i>

701
00:55:02,357 --> 00:55:05,727
<i>He can control the Nine-Tails
and his Teleportation Jutsu surpasses</i>

702
00:55:05,752 --> 00:55:07,462
<i>both Lord Second's and mine.</i>

703
00:55:07,854 --> 00:55:11,023
<i>And he has some
dangerous ideology.</i>

704
00:55:12,083 --> 00:55:13,960
<i>I must deal with him now</i>

705
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:16,730
<i>or he'll be even more trouble
than the Nine-Tails!</i>

706
00:55:19,031 --> 00:55:21,033
<i>If I transport myself to
the village now,</i>

707
00:55:21,058 --> 00:55:24,102
<i>he will follow and the battlefield
will become even more chaotic.</i>

708
00:55:26,155 --> 00:55:27,907
<i>If he's anything like Madara,</i>

709
00:55:28,157 --> 00:55:31,619
<i>he can't keep the Nine-Tails under
the summoning jutsu for too long.</i>

710
00:55:32,486 --> 00:55:34,655
<i>I just have to entrust
the village to Lord Third.</i>

711
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,708
<i>As for me...</i>

712
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,710
<i>I must take this guy
down right here!</i>

713
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:41,713
Now that I have freed the Nine-Tails,

714
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:44,966
you people have no hope left!

715
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:00,899
<i>His flesh...</i>

716
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:03,777
<i>My physical attacks have
no effect on him,</i>

717
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:05,779
<i>but he makes himself materialize
to attack me.</i>

718
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:10,450
<i>Meaning, I can only aim for him
when we both strike blows!</i>

719
00:56:11,918 --> 00:56:14,963
<i>But his risk lies during
the moment of attack.</i>

720
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:19,376
<i>And considering the time remaining
on the Nine-Tails' summoning jutsu,</i>

721
00:56:19,692 --> 00:56:22,528
<i>he doesn't want a long battle either.</i>

722
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:27,133
<i>The one who attacks
an instant quicker than the other...</i>

723
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:28,676
<i>will win this match!</i>

724
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:51,282
I win.

725
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:04,254
<i>Damn it! He flew to that
kunai from earlier!</i>

726
00:57:05,363 --> 00:57:07,448
That was my Flying Raijin, Level 2.

727
00:57:31,022 --> 00:57:32,315
You got me.

728
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:35,693
This is what is meant by "elusive."

729
00:57:36,685 --> 00:57:38,270
I should never have let down my guard.

730
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,350
<i>Flying Raijin Jutsu!</i>

731
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,226
<i>So that's it...</i>

732
00:57:44,251 --> 00:57:46,754
<i>He marked my body somewhere!</i>

733
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:49,549
A Contract Seal?

734
00:57:50,224 --> 00:57:52,435
He intends to separate
the Nine-Tails from me?

735
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:56,347
With this, the Nine-Tails
is no longer yours!

736
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:08,084
I must hand it to
the Fourth Hokage.

737
00:58:08,442 --> 00:58:12,446
You wounded me and managed
to pull out the Nine-Tails.

738
00:58:13,373 --> 00:58:15,917
However, the Nine-Tails will
be mine eventually.

739
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,913
<i>I am going to rule the world...</i>

740
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:23,041
<i>And there are so many ways
to go about doing that.</i>

741
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:29,297
<i>That tone...
He's not joking around.</i>

742
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:43,311
Keep him occupied until
the Fourth Hokage arrives!

743
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:50,818
<i>This is terrible.</i>

744
00:58:53,413 --> 00:58:55,457
He's going to do that again?

745
00:58:55,482 --> 00:58:56,567
Lord Third!

746
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:00,536
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

747
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:04,423
This is...

748
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:06,417
It's the Fourth Hokage!

749
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:10,446
Hold down the Nine-Tails
for just a while!

750
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:14,934
<i>That's going to be tough...
even for me!</i>

751
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,887
In order to transport
something this big,

752
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:19,681
I'll need just as much chakra!

753
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:27,147
Minato...

754
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:29,915
Did he fly off with the Nine-Tails?

755
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:32,986
That way!

756
00:59:43,805 --> 00:59:45,682
I must put up a barrier immediately.

757
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:48,418
<i>My chakra is almost...</i>

758
00:59:48,718 --> 00:59:51,721
I can still do it, Minato.

759
01:00:03,315 --> 01:00:04,218
Kushina!

760
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:09,981
Did I wake you up?

761
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,317
I'm sorry, Naruto.

762
01:00:13,275 --> 01:00:14,159
Kushina...

763
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:19,282
I'm going to drag the Nine-Tails
down with me to my death.

764
01:00:19,774 --> 01:00:25,530
That will delay the revival
of the Nine-Tails.

765
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:30,209
I'll be able to save all of you

766
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:33,421
with what little chakra
I have left.

767
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:37,967
Thank you for everything
you've done for me.

768
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:42,822
Kushina...

769
01:00:43,498 --> 01:00:47,501
You're the reason that
I became the Fourth Hokage!

770
01:00:48,336 --> 01:00:49,912
You made me a man!

771
01:00:51,631 --> 01:00:53,842
And you made me
this baby's father!

772
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:57,786
And yet...

773
01:00:58,354 --> 01:01:01,524
Minato, don't give me that look!

774
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:07,288
I'm happy that you loved me.

775
01:01:07,813 --> 01:01:13,402
And today... is this child's birthday.

776
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:20,068
If I were to imagine me alive,
and our future together,

777
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:22,387
the three of us as a family...

778
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:28,101
I can't see us having
anything but a happy life.

779
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:36,109
If I were allowed just one regret,

780
01:01:36,924 --> 01:01:39,468
it's that I won't be able
to see Naruto grow up.

781
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:42,448
How I wish I could have seen that.

782
01:01:43,766 --> 01:01:49,272
Kushina, there is no need for you
to die with the Nine-Tails.

783
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:52,708
Preserve what little chakra
you have left

784
01:01:52,733 --> 01:01:54,726
for when you see Naruto again.

785
01:01:56,770 --> 01:02:00,232
I'll seal all of your remaining
chakra inside Naruto.

786
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:02,510
It will be part of
an Eight Signed Seal.

787
01:02:03,044 --> 01:02:06,214
Then I'll take the Nine-Tails
with me

788
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:10,435
with the only Sealing jutsu I can do
since I'm not a Jinchuriki,

789
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:11,920
the Reaper Death Seal!

790
01:02:12,136 --> 01:02:14,472
But the user of that jutsu...!

791
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:16,524
And one more thing.

792
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:19,318
I will only seal half
of the Nine-Tails.

793
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:23,489
Sealing a power this immense
is physically impossible.

794
01:02:23,923 --> 01:02:25,841
It's also strategically unwise.

795
01:02:26,617 --> 01:02:29,787
If you take the Nine-Tails and
its seal with you when you die,

796
01:02:29,812 --> 01:02:32,148
there won't be a Jinchuriki around
when he reemerges.

797
01:02:32,456 --> 01:02:34,959
That will upset the balance of power
between the Tailed Beasts.

798
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:40,298
The Reaper Death Seal will seal
half of the Nine-Tails with me forever.

799
01:02:40,498 --> 01:02:43,793
As for the other half
of the Nine-Tails...

800
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:47,855
I will seal it inside Naruto with
the Eight Signed Seal!

801
01:02:49,056 --> 01:02:50,767
I know what you want to say.

802
01:02:51,551 --> 01:02:55,179
But remember what Master Jiraiya
said about world upheaval.

803
01:02:55,913 --> 01:02:59,042
And the calamities that would follow.

804
01:02:59,883 --> 01:03:02,135
Two things were confirmed
for me today.

805
01:03:03,262 --> 01:03:05,264
That masked man
who attacked you today

806
01:03:05,657 --> 01:03:08,242
is a harbinger of disaster!

807
01:03:08,825 --> 01:03:12,954
And the one who will
stop him is this child!

808
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:18,202
I don't know why,
but I'm convinced of this.

809
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:20,838
But Minato...!

810
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:29,305
<i>Reaper Death Seal!</i>

811
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,335
Let's put our trust in this child!

812
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,487
He's our son, after all!

813
01:03:47,272 --> 01:03:49,108
Lord Third, what's wrong?!

814
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:52,954
It's no good.

815
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:55,081
I can't go further than
this point

816
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:57,959
because of the barrier put up to
keep Nine-Tails from escaping!

817
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:02,088
Those two are planning to take care
of Nine-Tails themselves!

818
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:11,389
<i>Damn you, Fourth Hokage!</i>

819
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:13,216
<i>Seal!</i>

820
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:22,525
<i>My body is getting numb...</i>

821
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:25,611
<i>I never expected
such massive chakra...</i>

822
01:04:28,155 --> 01:04:29,740
<i>Damn you!</i>

823
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:34,412
All right,
next is the Eight Signed Seal.

824
01:04:35,913 --> 01:04:37,540
I will seal the Nine-Tails
inside Naruto.

825
01:04:38,616 --> 01:04:40,451
<i>The Ritual Altar?</i>

826
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:43,170
<i>Does he intend to seal me again?</i>

827
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:46,090
<i>Furthermore...
Inside that baby?</i>

828
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,320
Kushina! Are you all right?

829
01:04:55,090 --> 01:04:56,508
<i>Right now!</i>

830
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:19,582
<i>Why you—!</i>

831
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:24,587
Okay, I understand that
you're determined to do this.

832
01:05:25,862 --> 01:05:27,364
Thank you, Kushina.

833
01:05:34,171 --> 01:05:35,321
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

834
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:40,811
Nine-Tails!

835
01:05:40,836 --> 01:05:43,964
What?! Lord Fourth too!
What's the meaning of this?!

836
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:47,360
Gerotora, I'm going to give you
the Sealing Formula's key.

837
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:51,364
Take it immediately to Master Jiraiya
and store it away.

838
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:55,034
Understood. I confirm the key
is in my possession.

839
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:56,369
And now, I'm off!

840
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,042
That should do it.

841
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:11,217
Kushina, my time is running out.

842
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:15,262
I'm going start
the Eight Signed Seal.

843
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:19,308
I want to put some of
my chakra in Naruto too.

844
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:22,311
It'll be quite a while
before we can see him.

845
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:24,522
Let's tell him what
we want to say.

846
01:06:25,731 --> 01:06:27,149
Naruto...

847
01:06:27,549 --> 01:06:31,688
Don't be a picky eater.
Eat lots and grow strong.

848
01:06:32,863 --> 01:06:37,034
Make sure you bathe every day
and keep warm.

849
01:06:37,351 --> 01:06:41,480
Also don't stay up late.
You need lots of sleep.

850
01:06:41,981 --> 01:06:44,900
And make friends.

851
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:47,895
You don't need a lot of friends.

852
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:51,924
Just a few...
Ones you can really, really trust.

853
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:56,846
I wasn't very good at it,

854
01:06:56,887 --> 01:07:00,266
but keep up with your studies
and practice your ninjutsu hard.

855
01:07:00,557 --> 01:07:05,228
Remember that everyone has
strengths and weaknesses.

856
01:07:05,829 --> 01:07:09,750
So don't get too depressed if
you can't do something well.

857
01:07:10,776 --> 01:07:15,656
Respect your teachers and
upperclassmen at the Academy.

858
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:19,035
Oh, and this is important.

859
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:21,787
It's about the Three Prohibitions
for a shinobi.

860
01:07:22,070 --> 01:07:25,365
Be extra careful about lending
and borrowing money.

861
01:07:26,024 --> 01:07:29,110
Put your mission wages into
your savings account.

862
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:32,173
No alcohol until you're twenty.

863
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:36,302
Too much can ruin your health,
so drink in moderation.

864
01:07:37,018 --> 01:07:40,563
Next is women...

865
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:45,269
I'm a woman, so I don't know
too much about this but...

866
01:07:46,069 --> 01:07:48,071
All you need to remember is that

867
01:07:48,096 --> 01:07:50,140
this world is made up
of men and women.

868
01:07:51,275 --> 01:07:54,361
So it's only natural to take
an interest in girls...

869
01:07:54,987 --> 01:07:57,156
But just don't get hooked
on bad women.

870
01:07:58,282 --> 01:08:00,534
Find someone just like me.

871
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:08,459
Speaking of the Three Prohibitions,
be wary of Jiraiya-sensei, you know.

872
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:14,715
Naruto, from now on,

873
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:18,719
you're going to face
lots of pain and hardship.

874
01:08:19,103 --> 01:08:21,355
Be true to yourself.

875
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:23,891
Have a dream and

876
01:08:24,082 --> 01:08:29,254
have the confidence to make
that dream come true!

877
01:08:29,688 --> 01:08:32,274
There's so much...

878
01:08:32,807 --> 01:08:39,397
Oh, so much more that
I want to pass on to you.

879
01:08:40,132 --> 01:08:42,134
I wish I could stay with you longer.

880
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,246
I love you.

881
01:08:45,846 --> 01:08:48,933
Minato, I'm sorry I used up
your time.

882
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,960
Oh, it's okay.

883
01:08:52,419 --> 01:08:55,089
Naruto, my message to you is...

884
01:08:56,156 --> 01:09:00,619
I guess it's the same as
your nagging mother's.

885
01:09:03,113 --> 01:09:04,114
<i>Eight Signed Seal.</i>

886
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:18,946
I'm sorry for making you
the Nine-Tails' vessel.

887
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:22,658
For putting our burden
on your shoulders...

888
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:26,954
For not being able
to live by your side...

889
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:29,748
For not being able to
shower you with love.

890
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:32,084
You don't have to apologize.

891
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:37,289
It was rough in the past
because I was a Jinchuriki.

892
01:09:38,632 --> 01:09:41,635
But I never held it
against you or Dad.

893
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:47,266
I admit I didn't really know
what parental love was.

894
01:09:48,392 --> 01:09:51,312
After all,
you and Dad weren't around.

895
01:09:51,937 --> 01:09:53,314
I just had a feeling.

896
01:09:54,231 --> 01:10:00,321
But I know now that you and Dad
gave your lives just for me.

897
01:10:00,713 --> 01:10:03,231
And I realize that even more
than the Nine-Tails,

898
01:10:03,256 --> 01:10:05,217
I was filled up with your love!

899
01:10:05,467 --> 01:10:07,469
I'm happy!

900
01:10:07,751 --> 01:10:10,504
I'm glad I'm your son,
Mom and Dad!

901
01:10:11,489 --> 01:10:13,508
<i>Minato, are you listening?</i>

902
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:18,255
<i>Our hopes did reach our boy!</i>

903
01:10:18,797 --> 01:10:20,257
Naruto...

904
01:10:20,499 --> 01:10:22,976
Thank you for letting me
be your mom.

905
01:10:24,454 --> 01:10:26,781
And thank you for letting
Minato be your dad.

906
01:10:28,965 --> 01:10:34,262
Thank you for...
being born to us!

907
01:10:35,856 --> 01:10:37,316
<i>Thank you...</i>

908
01:10:40,986 --> 01:10:42,988
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

909
01:10:46,658 --> 01:10:47,659
<i>Mom...</i>

910
01:10:49,553 --> 01:10:50,721
<i>From now on,</i>

911
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:55,542
<i>I promise I'll eat vegetables
and not just ramen.</i>

912
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:59,463
<i>I like taking baths,
so don't worry about that.</i>

913
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:01,423
<i>I go to the hot springs a lot too.</i>

914
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:04,969
<i>And I get lots of sleep.</i>

915
01:11:05,477 --> 01:11:07,646
<i>In fact, I sleep too much,
ya know!</i>

916
01:11:09,223 --> 01:11:12,935
<i>As for friends,
I have lots of good ones.</i>

917
01:11:13,894 --> 01:11:16,063
<i>I wish you could have met them.</i>

918
01:11:17,314 --> 01:11:21,277
<i>There's one that I'm not
getting along with though.</i>

919
01:11:22,736 --> 01:11:26,448
<i>As for studying...
Well, you were right to worry, Mom.</i>

920
01:11:26,739 --> 01:11:29,033
<i>But I don't let it get me down, ya know!</i>

921
01:11:30,636 --> 01:11:34,623
<i>A lot happened with my teachers and
upperclassmen during my Academy days,</i>

922
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:36,625
<i>but we respect each other now.</i>

923
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:42,047
<i>Master Jiraiya taught me about
the Three Shinobi Prohibitions.</i>

924
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,676
<i>You were right about him, Mom!</i>

925
01:11:46,218 --> 01:11:49,638
<i>But he's the one who taught me
how a shinobi should live!</i>

926
01:11:49,979 --> 01:11:51,898
<i>He was a great shinobi.</i>

927
01:11:53,959 --> 01:11:57,629
<i>I'm Naruto Uzumaki,
a ninja of the Hidden Leaf!</i>

928
01:11:58,055 --> 01:12:00,600
<i>My dream is to become the Hokage!</i>

929
01:12:01,841 --> 01:12:05,512
<i>And I'll surpass all the Hokage
who came before me!</i>

930
01:12:09,608 --> 01:12:12,611
And I'm going to be cooler
than Dad!

931
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:16,957
And I'm going to be
a stronger shinobi than you, Mom!
