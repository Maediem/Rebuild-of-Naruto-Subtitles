1
00:00:00,324 --> 00:00:03,369
Naruto has arrived at
every battlefield!

2
00:00:04,083 --> 00:00:04,750
Good.

3
00:00:05,527 --> 00:00:06,111
Over there!

4
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:08,542
– <i>The combined First and Second Companies</i>
– And those guys too!

5
00:00:08,567 --> 00:00:10,193
<i>Have detected just about
all the enemies!</i>

6
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:13,430
<i>Earth Style:</i>

7
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:17,684
<i>They're advancing with
incredible momentum.</i>

8
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,272
What was that?

9
00:00:22,377 --> 00:00:23,837
Sorry, Bushy Brow!

10
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:29,437
<i>The Third Company also
seems to be dominating!</i>

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,490
<i>Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken!</i>

12
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:34,701
– This is...
– huge!

13
00:00:40,737 --> 00:00:42,573
The Fifth Company has
the upper hand as well!

14
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,711
Cha!

15
00:00:56,509 --> 00:00:59,720
<i>The medical unit has suppressed
all their enemies.</i>

16
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,279
It worked!

17
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:05,356
The tide of battle has turned
overwhelmingly in our favor.

18
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,317
See?

19
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,398
Humph!

20
00:01:09,324 --> 00:01:10,993
Now we just need to stop Madara

21
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:13,373
who is approaching
with Jinchuriki in tow.

22
00:01:13,548 --> 00:01:15,759
We should focus
our remaining strength there

23
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,587
and hit him with all we've got!

24
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,187
<i>I never expected to be
at such a disadvantage.</i>

25
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:31,382
<i>Still, I'm glad that clone was sealed
before he could say too much.</i>

26
00:01:32,084 --> 00:01:33,885
<i>Given Naruto and his power...</i>

27
00:01:34,179 --> 00:01:38,558
<i>Even if it's a Reanimated body,
it will take some time to regenerate.</i>

28
00:01:55,954 --> 00:01:57,700
<i>How naïve, Ohnoki...</i>

29
00:01:57,954 --> 00:01:59,574
<i>You were my student.</i>

30
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,976
<i>How could you miss that
I had fragmented myself?</i>

31
00:02:06,089 --> 00:02:07,493
<i>This is...</i>

32
00:02:08,926 --> 00:02:12,215
<i>a violently rotating...
Rasengan!</i>

33
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,150
<i>Earth Style: Boulder Jutsu!</i>

34
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:47,959
<i>Be careful, I'm...</i>

35
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,598
As I thought,
I can't get this tag off.

36
00:03:02,888 --> 00:03:04,851
It's an impressive Sealing Jutsu.

37
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,962
<i>If I remember correctly,</i>

38
00:03:11,398 --> 00:03:13,817
<i>Mu's jutsu is not cloning,
but fission.</i>

39
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,780
<i>Because the real body
simply splits into two,</i>

40
00:03:18,087 --> 00:03:19,870
<i>he doesn't need to make signs
and it's faster.</i>

41
00:03:19,895 --> 00:03:21,397
<i>However, his power is halved.</i>

42
00:03:25,461 --> 00:03:27,033
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

43
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:52,399
At last. It seems he successfully
brought that brat Nagato to maturity.

44
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:57,538
The user of this Reanimation Jutsu
has a keen understanding of war.

45
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,821
To think of using you...

46
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,952
Did you say "Reanimation"?

47
00:04:05,172 --> 00:04:07,758
This is not the Rinne Rebirth Jutsu...?

48
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,824
J-Just a minute!

49
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,200
What is it?!

50
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:16,552
The enemy is resisting
Gaara's Fourth Company!

51
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:20,385
<i>But... what is this chakra?!</i>

52
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,223
Huh? What is this?!

53
00:04:26,095 --> 00:04:27,829
What are you sensing?

54
00:04:28,807 --> 00:04:29,808
Over there!

55
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,020
What is it?

56
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,142
Hm?

57
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,569
That's the Second Tsuchikage!

58
00:04:39,206 --> 00:04:41,082
I thought Gaara sealed him away!

59
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:44,367
Impossible... He used
Fragmentation in that state...?

60
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:45,712
It's not him!

61
00:04:46,157 --> 00:04:47,158
There's someone else!

62
00:04:48,607 --> 00:04:49,447
What?!

63
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,732
Hey, there's one more!

64
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,418
H-He is...!

65
00:04:55,289 --> 00:04:56,162
Who is it?

66
00:05:00,061 --> 00:05:00,905
You've come at last!

67
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,223
Uchiha...

68
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:08,994
Madara!

69
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,356
<i>That's him?</i>

70
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,861
So that's what he looked
like beneath the mask.

71
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:22,691
He looks exactly the same!

72
00:05:23,306 --> 00:05:24,808
What's going on?!

73
00:05:25,174 --> 00:05:26,217
What do you mean?

74
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:28,015
Look closely at his eyes.

75
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,872
That's a Reanimation!

76
00:05:31,627 --> 00:05:35,422
The Reanimation Jutsu brings
the dead back to this realm...

77
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,838
Which means he had been dead!

78
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,548
Wait a second!

79
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,112
I thought HQ reported
Madara elsewhere,

80
00:05:43,137 --> 00:05:46,590
approaching from the other direction
with the Jinchuriki, right?

81
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,391
But there's no mistake...
He's Madara Uchiha!

82
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:54,312
The one I fought when I was young.

83
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:58,524
Then who's the man...

84
00:06:00,028 --> 00:06:01,821
behind the mask?!

85
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:05,462
So the guy in front of us
is the real Madara.

86
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:09,379
Then the guy we thought
was Madara... isn't Madara?

87
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,621
So it seems...

88
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:16,384
As Tsuchikage, you've utilized
the Akatsuki in the past.

89
00:06:16,474 --> 00:06:18,310
Can you speculate who
that masked man might be?

90
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,220
There's no one I can think of.

91
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:25,676
But it doesn't matter who he is!
We still need to stop him!

92
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:28,879
Their headbands say "Shinobi."

93
00:06:29,524 --> 00:06:30,914
But I see them wearing shinobi gear

94
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:32,631
from each of
the Five Great Nations...

95
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,103
Is this a new allied army?

96
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,731
It does appear that we're at war.

97
00:06:40,154 --> 00:06:41,947
Coming from him...

98
00:06:42,307 --> 00:06:44,760
He must have something in mind.

99
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:48,444
But things don't seem like
they're going as planned.

100
00:06:49,144 --> 00:06:51,938
Why else would he revive me
in this state?

101
00:06:53,782 --> 00:06:55,867
Who is the caster of
the Reanimation Jutsu?

102
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,167
Who knows?

103
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,842
<i>I'm Kabuto.</i>

104
00:07:06,153 --> 00:07:07,779
I am... his collaborator.

105
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,632
Speaking through
a Reanimation Link?

106
00:07:10,894 --> 00:07:11,933
Such a sneaky one you are...

107
00:07:12,507 --> 00:07:14,912
Your Reanimation is quite special.

108
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,346
I've fixed you up so that you're even
greater than you were in your glory days.

109
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:23,943
You know what I was like
during my "glory days"?

110
00:07:24,482 --> 00:07:25,258
No.

111
00:07:25,995 --> 00:07:28,167
Which is why
I want you to show me...

112
00:07:28,553 --> 00:07:30,519
your legendary Uchiha power.

113
00:07:35,182 --> 00:07:36,851
I guess they won't be easy
to capture.

114
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:43,713
Very well...

115
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,530
Here he comes!

116
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,450
Do not look directly into
his eyes!

117
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:56,241
<i>You can't use the Particle Style in
your divided state right now...</i>

118
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,461
Sensory Types! Watch Lord Mu!

119
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,129
Wait!

120
00:09:05,605 --> 00:09:08,150
Gaara, you and Lord Tsuchikage
must recover first.

121
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,842
Naruto, instead of your clones,
go into that mode!

122
00:09:12,554 --> 00:09:14,107
The truth is, I can't anymore.

123
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,813
I used up my chakra
in the earlier fight!

124
00:10:09,719 --> 00:10:11,337
Do you want to dance too?

125
00:10:23,773 --> 00:10:24,815
Don't underestimate me!

126
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:35,072
<i>Fire Style:</i>

127
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,703
<i>Majestic Destroyer Flame!</i>

128
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,768
His jutsu spans a wide area!

129
00:10:44,568 --> 00:10:46,904
– <i>Water Style: Wall of Water!</i>
– <i>Water Style: Wall of Water!</i>

130
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:11,799
Here he comes!

131
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,190
This is... as far as you'll go!

132
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,386
<i>Giant Rasengan!</i>

133
00:11:51,735 --> 00:11:53,307
<i>Earth Style: Mobile Core!</i>

134
00:12:17,391 --> 00:12:18,606
A Susano'o...

135
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:21,762
He's already activated
the Mangekyo Sharingan!

136
00:12:28,202 --> 00:12:29,579
How much longer, Naruto?!

137
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,396
Just hold on!

138
00:13:14,562 --> 00:13:15,349
Sorry!

139
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,502
I'm ready!

140
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,410
Get back, everyone!

141
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,343
Go, Kazekage!

142
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,114
<i>Earth Style:
Lightened Boulder Jutsu!</i>

143
00:13:27,814 --> 00:13:30,051
I made the surrounding
sand lighter too!

144
00:13:31,351 --> 00:13:34,883
<i>With sand this light,
I could...!</i>

145
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,373
Naruto!

146
00:13:39,398 --> 00:13:41,274
Yeah! Let's go!

147
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:48,618
<i>If it's like Sasuke's,
external attacks are ineffective.</i>

148
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:52,206
<i>So I should use the sand
at Madara's feet!</i>

149
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:57,447
Naruto!

150
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,309
<i>Rasen Shuriken!</i>

151
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:10,085
Too much energy...

152
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,855
H-He... absorbed it!

153
00:14:16,544 --> 00:14:18,796
What the...?! How?

154
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:21,777
How come he's got the Rinnegan?

155
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,539
My guess was right.

156
00:14:33,816 --> 00:14:37,170
What comes naturally after
the Sharingan is the Rinnegan.

157
00:14:37,979 --> 00:14:41,816
I awakened the Rinnegan
just prior to my death.

158
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,967
You said your name was Kabuto?

159
00:14:45,412 --> 00:14:47,372
What did you do to this body?

160
00:14:47,961 --> 00:14:49,467
Like I told you.

161
00:14:50,402 --> 00:14:52,904
I made you better than
you were at your peak.

162
00:14:53,388 --> 00:14:56,767
You bastard...
You know the secrets of my body?

163
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:01,275
You can't even read
the Uchiha Stone Tablet!

164
00:15:01,436 --> 00:15:03,229
But you still managed
to decipher it?

165
00:15:04,828 --> 00:15:08,623
I just tested some hypotheses
drawn from years of data

166
00:15:08,765 --> 00:15:11,059
from experiments Lord Orochimaru
and I conducted.

167
00:15:11,501 --> 00:15:15,630
And now...
You are verifying my hypotheses.

168
00:15:16,298 --> 00:15:19,668
You have obtained a fragment
of that God's power...

169
00:15:19,693 --> 00:15:21,486
the power of the Sage of Six Paths.

170
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,797
Thanks to the power I built into you.

171
00:15:24,668 --> 00:15:26,127
Do not misunderstand.

172
00:15:26,683 --> 00:15:28,977
This is not power of your creation!

173
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:53,452
Damn!

174
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,205
N-No way...

175
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:58,749
What is that?

176
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,045
It's out of our league!

177
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,839
Is this the power of a god?

178
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,067
A meteorite? How did he...?

179
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,278
Is that really ninjutsu?

180
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,531
We can't outrun it!

181
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,116
This is not good...

182
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,158
Damn it!

183
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,412
It's still too early to give up!

184
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,540
Never give up without even trying!

185
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:42,312
Do what you can, no matter how small
the effect it may have!

186
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,055
Lord Tsuchikage!

187
00:16:46,562 --> 00:16:49,607
Everyone, get as far away
from here as possible!

188
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:51,635
Hey!

189
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,928
Run!

190
00:16:53,002 --> 00:16:54,128
Hurry!

191
00:16:54,153 --> 00:16:55,154
Hurry!

192
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,058
You're taking us out too?

193
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,727
Of course.

194
00:17:00,491 --> 00:17:02,896
That was the original point
of the Reanimation Jutsu...

195
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:04,589
To take others out with you.

196
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:08,260
We'll be restored shortly.

197
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,113
A shinobi that can fly...

198
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,950
Then, this must be the Both Scales brat
from the Stone.

199
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,454
What's Gramps Tsuchikage
trying to do?!

200
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,290
He's going to try to lighten
the meteorite to stop it!

201
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:32,009
<i>Earth Style: Lightened Boulder Jutsu!</i>

202
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,614
<i>Just a tad more...</i>

203
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,868
<i>A little more... to stop it!</i>

204
00:18:04,021 --> 00:18:05,731
That Fence Sitter brat...

205
00:18:06,407 --> 00:18:08,430
He's gotten a little better.

206
00:18:13,942 --> 00:18:14,843
All right!

207
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:16,002
It's stopped!

208
00:18:16,027 --> 00:18:17,596
We're saved...

209
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:18,680
Leave it to Lord Tsuchikage.

210
00:18:21,115 --> 00:18:22,116
Well then...

211
00:18:23,012 --> 00:18:25,871
What will you do about
the second one, Ohnoki?

212
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,959
What was that?!

213
00:18:48,996 --> 00:18:53,792
Why did the masked man
specifically claim to be Madara?

214
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:58,554
The presence of Madara...

215
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,181
Even if he were a fraud,

216
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,184
if you can convince the world that
he exists, it will tremble in fear.

217
00:19:05,057 --> 00:19:06,726
The name itself is power.

218
00:19:08,268 --> 00:19:10,104
That name made us
cast aside our differences...

219
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:14,361
It fooled us,
then drew us all into war!

220
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:18,949
What happened?!

221
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,118
This is from our Relay Intel Unit.

222
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:24,037
A giant boulder big enough
to block out the sky

223
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,206
has been dropped onto
the Fourth Company's battlefield.

224
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,375
It's the source of this tremor!

225
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,881
Any further reports from
the Fourth Company since then?

226
00:19:32,907 --> 00:19:34,450
What's going on?

227
00:19:35,061 --> 00:19:37,379
So many casualties...
in just one sweep!

228
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,428
I'm sure of it...

229
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,055
It's Madara's jutsu or
something close to it!

230
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,725
Lady Tsunade! At this rate...!

231
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:46,750
I'll go!

232
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,753
What in the world...

233
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,298
was that?!

234
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,290
Rubber Pops...

235
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:53,043
I'm just a clone, so why did you...?!

236
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,254
I feel bad about the others.

237
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:59,258
But clone or not, you are needed here.

238
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,385
In order for us to win.

239
00:21:05,127 --> 00:21:06,519
What about Gramps Tsuchikage?!

240
00:21:12,003 --> 00:21:13,340
Gramps Tsuchikage!

241
00:21:16,469 --> 00:21:17,375
It's okay.

242
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,069
He's alive...

243
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,738
But he's seriously hurt!

244
00:21:32,757 --> 00:21:35,260
So this is the power of
the Sage of Six Paths...

245
00:21:36,031 --> 00:21:37,045
Magnificent!

246
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,467
This landscape brings back memories.

247
00:21:44,438 --> 00:21:45,981
It's Kabuto, right?

248
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:49,014
How much do you really know?

249
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:50,575
About me?

250
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:52,899
I venture to guess...

251
00:21:53,489 --> 00:21:55,741
In that battle against
the First Hokage Hashirama,

252
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:59,526
you did not die at Valley of the End.

253
00:22:00,441 --> 00:22:01,442
On that day...

254
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:06,182
though you lost to
the First Hokage Hashirama,

255
00:22:06,207 --> 00:22:09,333
you gained a portion of
his power in return.

256
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,471
Am I wrong?

257
00:22:16,518 --> 00:22:17,727
No wonder...

258
00:22:18,812 --> 00:22:20,313
You're well-prepared.

259
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,508
You know about our plan?

260
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,635
Not in detail...

261
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:28,096
But I am your ally.

262
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:30,782
<i>Although I'm not certain</i>

263
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:35,098
<i>if that fake Madara intends
to carry out your plan exactly...</i>

264
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,608
By the way...

265
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:41,777
There are still some survivors.

266
00:22:42,582 --> 00:22:45,297
The Tsuchikage and Kazekage
are especially persistent.

267
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,201
What should we do?

268
00:22:48,364 --> 00:22:50,532
There's something I want to check first.

269
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,913
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

270
00:22:56,596 --> 00:22:58,725
My stomach... feels hot!

271
00:22:58,862 --> 00:23:01,468
<i>This chakra that summons me...</i>

272
00:23:02,288 --> 00:23:03,790
<i>Is it Madara?!</i>

273
00:23:08,514 --> 00:23:11,267
It seems the Nine-Tails
hasn't been captured yet.

274
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,059
That's the purpose of this war.

275
00:23:15,196 --> 00:23:17,323
The Nine-Tails is sealed
in a Jinchuriki.

276
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:18,772
For now...

277
00:23:19,195 --> 00:23:21,447
See... He's over there.

278
00:23:21,857 --> 00:23:26,445
That boy is the Nine-Tails' Jinchuriki...
His name is Naruto Uzumaki.

279
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,073
Uzumaki?

280
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:30,992
Of Mito's clan, eh?

281
00:23:31,617 --> 00:23:34,329
He's the brat who attacked me earlier.

282
00:23:34,866 --> 00:23:37,040
But he's actually quite something.

283
00:23:37,855 --> 00:23:41,606
Capturing him is fine,
but that one in front of us is a clone.

284
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,339
Shall we go now to get the real one?

285
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,342
No. There's a jutsu I'd like to try out.

286
00:23:48,032 --> 00:23:50,232
I think it will make a prettier picture

287
00:23:50,257 --> 00:23:52,051
if I do it where there
are people around.

288
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,643
It's them! At four o'clock!

289
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:02,774
<i>Wood Style:
Deep Forest Emergence!</i>

290
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,112
He can do Wood Style?!

291
00:24:07,882 --> 00:24:10,009
I guess this is it for us...

292
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:21,877
<i>Naruto, this time I'll lend you
my power.</i>

293
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,549
Are you going to say you want me to
surrender my body over to you again?!

294
00:24:28,121 --> 00:24:29,083
<i>No...</i>

295
00:24:29,537 --> 00:24:31,122
<i>I'll just give you my chakra.</i>

296
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,164
<i>I don't care for Madara...</i>

297
00:24:33,374 --> 00:24:37,795
<i>If I'm going to be controlled,
I'd rather it be you than him!</i>

298
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,038
Naruto!

299
00:24:58,579 --> 00:25:00,790
<i>Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

300
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,548
<i>Giant Rasengan!</i>

301
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,595
<i>Do it... Naruto!</i>

302
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:18,642
<i>Giant Rasengan Barrage Line!</i>

303
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:29,941
As you mentioned, he's quite a guy.

304
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,374
Right?

305
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:41,998
<i>I used up the chakra Nine-Tails
gave me all at once!</i>

306
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,417
<i>I'm at my limit!</i>

307
00:25:44,605 --> 00:25:47,233
<i>I'm going to disappear
at any moment!</i>

308
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,676
Naruto... Enough.

309
00:25:53,162 --> 00:25:54,778
I'll take over from here.

310
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,597
Lord Tsuchikage,
you're in the same...

311
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,977
I finally have a chance
at reclaiming myself!

312
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:05,397
And I've got myself a worthy opponent!

313
00:26:10,043 --> 00:26:12,415
I'd like to try out some more jutsu...

314
00:26:13,501 --> 00:26:16,212
But I don't think
you can dance anymore, Ohnoki.

315
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,912
What's that look?

316
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,791
Long ago, I showed you
the difference in our strength.

317
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,088
Why?

318
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,424
That wasn't the agreement!

319
00:26:32,601 --> 00:26:33,852
Lord Hashirama is...

320
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,719
There is no alliance...

321
00:26:36,369 --> 00:26:38,714
Just submit to the power
of the Hidden Leaf!

322
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:43,810
And... never mention the name
of that shinobi in front of me!

323
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:52,611
We shinobi are weary
of all this endless fighting.

324
00:26:53,569 --> 00:26:57,406
We've kept on fighting for
the sake of our nations and villages.

325
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:01,202
Without a care about other nations
and villages, we just take!

326
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:05,353
We take away, then they take away
in an endless cycle...!

327
00:27:05,809 --> 00:27:09,855
Hatred has caused three wars!

328
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,786
That is life.

329
00:27:15,681 --> 00:27:17,353
I can't believe
you've lived this long

330
00:27:17,378 --> 00:27:20,006
and not learned a thing
from the pain of the past.

331
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,474
I've lived longer than you!

332
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,352
I've learned twice as much!

333
00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:28,872
It's because I've experienced pain
in the past

334
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:33,151
that I can even consider
what would be best for the future!

335
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,571
Yet this is the fourth war!

336
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,782
Is this what's best?

337
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,701
This war is different!

338
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:44,926
Unlike the past wars where
we took from each other...

339
00:27:44,951 --> 00:27:48,747
this time, we are fighting together
in order to achieve something different!

340
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,962
By watching them,

341
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:56,466
I've learned that time
does not simply pass by!

342
00:27:57,467 --> 00:28:01,805
Though slow in pace, the world is
building upon its past experiences...

343
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:05,433
and heading towards "peace."

344
00:28:08,995 --> 00:28:13,024
There's no need for the world
to mature any further.

345
00:28:13,657 --> 00:28:17,369
It can slumber in the genjutsu
of the Eternal Tsukuyomi!

346
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,901
Long ago, you made me forsake myself.

347
00:28:22,686 --> 00:28:23,687
That's why...

348
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:27,455
I will defeat you here...
and reclaim myself!

349
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:31,292
The one who will slumber shall be you!

350
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,338
Lord Tsuchikage!

351
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,595
Come... I will help you
reclaim yourself.

352
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:48,518
The elderly always complain
when young ones try to help...

353
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:52,407
I'll let you all meddle this time!

354
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,650
It seems they can still dance.

355
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,737
For myself!
For the future!

356
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,114
I will bring you down!

357
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,616
Damn it!

358
00:29:04,016 --> 00:29:05,017
Lady Tsunade!

359
00:29:05,421 --> 00:29:06,589
You said your name was Mabui?

360
00:29:07,147 --> 00:29:08,982
Prepare to do
your Ethereal Transmission Jutsu!

361
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,031
Come with me!

362
00:29:10,534 --> 00:29:13,496
Ethereal Transmission is
a jutsu used to transport items!

363
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:16,204
Unlike the Summoning
or Reverse Summoning Jutsu,

364
00:29:16,229 --> 00:29:17,689
it's impossible to transport people!

365
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:22,427
There's no time to argue!
Unless we try, we'll never know!

366
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:23,636
I do know!

367
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:27,515
The transmission rate is so fast, the body
cannot keep up and will be torn apart.

368
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,142
Death is certain!

369
00:29:29,981 --> 00:29:33,068
The only one who survived
Ethereal Transmission in the past

370
00:29:33,148 --> 00:29:35,150
is the Third Raikage!

371
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:39,527
But that was only because
of his superhuman body.

372
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:44,407
Now I can understand the Fourth Raikage
since he is of the Third's blood...

373
00:29:44,648 --> 00:29:46,455
But Lady Hokage,
it's impossible for you!

374
00:29:46,778 --> 00:29:48,082
Please reconsider this!

375
00:29:48,797 --> 00:29:50,870
I have an idea...

376
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:53,198
The Flying Raijin Jutsu.

377
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,543
We'll have Genma's squad come here.

378
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:58,087
Then if we mark
one of Katsuyu's clones,

379
00:29:58,112 --> 00:29:59,822
and transmit her to the site first...

380
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:03,351
I have the ability to survive
being split into pieces...

381
00:30:03,849 --> 00:30:04,891
That's not necessary!

382
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,411
I will use this.

383
00:30:08,305 --> 00:30:13,561
But it's a risky gamble.
And you tend to be unlucky with bets...

384
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,730
That's only when I bet money.

385
00:30:18,574 --> 00:30:22,695
It's different when I bet my life.
That's why I'm still alive.

386
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,449
Lord Raikage!

387
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,785
Please tell Lady Hokage
to think it over...

388
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,707
Mabui, prepare the Ethereal Transmission...

389
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,244
For two.

390
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:38,203
Not you too, Lord Raikage!

391
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,671
Shikaku!

392
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,821
We have no other options left.

393
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:45,693
It's time for the Supreme Commander
to make his appearance!

394
00:30:49,577 --> 00:30:52,369
However, Madara belongs
to the Uchiha Clan...

395
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,561
If we don't do something
about his Fire Style,

396
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:55,814
we won't have a chance at winning.

397
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,209
Damn!

398
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:11,119
The more I cut down,
the more confidence I gain.

399
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:14,080
That's why I just have to keep slicing!

400
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:15,498
Right!

401
00:31:15,638 --> 00:31:16,457
Yeah!

402
00:31:16,606 --> 00:31:19,192
I thought that was a lot of chakra
he was gathering...

403
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,629
But I had no idea the sword
would be this huge...

404
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:25,174
<i>I-I can't move...</i>

405
00:31:25,999 --> 00:31:30,133
<i>I can't believe that you changed
that sword so quickly.</i>

406
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:31,625
<i>Genma!</i>

407
00:31:32,252 --> 00:31:34,559
<i>Sorry, but could you please
just do as I say?</i>

408
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,602
Is that you, Shikaku?

409
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:40,359
<i>It's urgent. Do exactly as I say.
no interruptions!</i>

410
00:31:40,943 --> 00:31:44,777
<i>First off, the real Madara
has been reanimated.</i>

411
00:31:45,188 --> 00:31:47,482
<i>Sorry, but can I interrupt?</i>

412
00:31:47,802 --> 00:31:49,481
<i>I said no!</i>

413
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:52,660
Do it!

414
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,537
H-Here I go...

415
00:31:55,286 --> 00:31:56,657
<i>Ethereal Transmission Jutsu!</i>

416
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:06,883
I'm surprised...

417
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,093
Instantaneous travel
through dimensions...

418
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,721
Isn't that the Fourth Hokage's jutsu?

419
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:17,602
We used to belong to a squad
assigned to protect the Fourth Hokage.

420
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,687
Now, it's the Fifth Hokage, but...

421
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:23,066
The Flying Raijin Jutsu
was taught to us by the Fourth.

422
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:28,079
But unlike the Fourth,
it takes the three of us for it to work.

423
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,657
We apologize for the tight fit.

424
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,700
Please get ready!

425
00:32:32,881 --> 00:32:35,217
Lady Tsunade bears
the Jutsu Formula on her.

426
00:32:35,623 --> 00:32:37,622
The instant she arrives
at the battlefield,

427
00:32:37,764 --> 00:32:39,182
we will make the jump!

428
00:32:39,345 --> 00:32:40,346
Understood!

429
00:32:40,477 --> 00:32:43,014
I'm already late for marriage.
I won't be late for this.

430
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,477
I've relayed our coordinates to HQ!

431
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,851
<i>Reserve Seal! Release!</i>

432
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:01,106
<i>Ninja Art of Mitotic Regeneration!</i>

433
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:05,775
Are you all right?!

434
00:33:06,331 --> 00:33:07,026
Yeah...

435
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,903
Granny Tsunade?!

436
00:33:09,898 --> 00:33:12,323
<i>That's her regenerating jutsu!</i>

437
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,886
Since everyone is alive,
I guess we weren't late.

438
00:33:21,218 --> 00:33:25,097
Finally, I'll get to see some action...
I've been bored stiff!

439
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:27,713
All right, I'm ready!

440
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:33,720
Living long was well worth it.

441
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:37,140
Imagine... Being able to see the day

442
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,934
when the Five Kage would be united
and fight side by side.

443
00:33:44,005 --> 00:33:45,214
This is perfect.

444
00:33:45,612 --> 00:33:48,026
This will make my test worthwhile.

445
00:33:48,595 --> 00:33:50,222
Thank you, Princess Tsunade.

446
00:33:50,431 --> 00:33:51,654
I'll heal the two of you.

447
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:55,408
Raikage, Mizukage!
Buy me some time!

448
00:33:56,213 --> 00:33:57,339
Here we go, Mizukage!

449
00:33:57,549 --> 00:33:58,161
Right!

450
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,204
<i>Lava Style: Lava Monster Jutsu!</i>

451
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,589
<i>Jutsu this pitiful isn't even
worth absorbing!</i>

452
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:12,884
<i>He's fast!</i>

453
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:27,857
<i>Lateral Bolt of Pain! Chop!</i>

454
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:41,829
You guys come with me...
I'm going after the other one.

455
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,012
Help me!

456
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:48,628
Is that him?

457
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,129
Follow me! Let's go!

458
00:34:54,444 --> 00:34:55,904
How much longer, Hokage?!

459
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:57,553
Almost done!

460
00:34:58,542 --> 00:35:00,866
Are you okay, Granny Tsunade?

461
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,051
Whenever you use the jutsu
from that forehead mark,

462
00:35:03,076 --> 00:35:04,953
you get old and fall down!

463
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:09,482
This is different from
the time with Pain.

464
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:12,020
I only healed myself...

465
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,403
And besides,
it wasn't much of an injury.

466
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,823
I have more than enough chakra!

467
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,451
Then heal me too!

468
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:23,704
I may be a clone,
but I can't afford to disappear yet!

469
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,081
I'll join you and...

470
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,290
That's not necessary.

471
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,376
Why...?!

472
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:33,840
This is no longer just
a war to protect you.

473
00:35:42,848 --> 00:35:46,435
Lightning Style Body Flicker
and Lava Style Kekkei Genkai...

474
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,272
Impressive attacks...

475
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,612
I usually like men
who are hard to melt...

476
00:35:57,047 --> 00:35:59,157
But you, I want to avoid.

477
00:35:59,671 --> 00:36:01,966
He counters me even
with my speed.

478
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:17,550
More speed... I need to increase
my power to crush his defense!

479
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:21,336
What about your defense?

480
00:36:32,631 --> 00:36:35,277
A Stone Golem and a Sand Shield...

481
00:36:36,182 --> 00:36:39,727
This war is now a battle
to protect each other!

482
00:36:40,127 --> 00:36:42,505
Then, I want to fight Madara too!

483
00:36:43,097 --> 00:36:45,308
A two-fold defensive wall of
Sand and Stone, huh?

484
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,622
Also, quite impressive!

485
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,749
Here he comes!

486
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,500
Time to go on the offensive!

487
00:36:51,788 --> 00:36:54,815
Mizukage! Raikage!
Listen to me now!

488
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,184
Mizukage!

489
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,895
<i>Water Style: Hidden Mist Jutsu!</i>

490
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,902
Let's do this, Raikage!

491
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:18,903
Right!

492
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:23,532
<i>Super Weighted Boulder Jutsu!</i>

493
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:38,965
Granny, fix me up now!

494
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,466
Listen to me, Naruto...

495
00:37:41,276 --> 00:37:43,798
You see... This war we're fighting...

496
00:37:44,259 --> 00:37:47,056
In the beginning, I only agreed
to join the Allied Forces

497
00:37:47,081 --> 00:37:50,000
to get rid of the Akatsuki.

498
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:55,231
But as I fought alongside you all,

499
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,900
I started feeling differently.

500
00:37:58,667 --> 00:38:00,753
So now, I want to be here

501
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,906
as the Tsuchikage of
the Allied Shinobi Forces!

502
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:05,274
In the same manner,

503
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:09,912
shinobi villages that were once
at odds have joined together,

504
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,455
are changing and becoming one!

505
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,959
So maybe, this system of
the shinobi world

506
00:38:14,984 --> 00:38:18,904
which has bred so much hatred
can change!

507
00:38:19,713 --> 00:38:20,839
Naruto...

508
00:38:21,171 --> 00:38:23,467
Let us deal with this Madara!

509
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:25,775
I swear we shall settle this
once and for all!

510
00:38:26,506 --> 00:38:28,383
It will be our first step

511
00:38:28,408 --> 00:38:30,869
in stopping the curse of hatred
we've been under until now!

512
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:35,893
Like Madara, we are similarly guilty
of stirring up hatred in the past.

513
00:38:35,918 --> 00:38:38,296
It is our responsibility
to make things right!

514
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,652
Rest assured and leave this to us!

515
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:43,738
So...

516
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,866
You go take care of
the other Madara!

517
00:38:47,255 --> 00:38:50,828
That will become the first step
in promoting hope for the future.

518
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,581
Old one, new one...

519
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:57,626
Defeating both Madaras
will bring an end to this war!

520
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,756
We will protect you on this battlefield!

521
00:39:01,267 --> 00:39:05,009
So protect us by fighting over there!

522
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:10,598
Naruto's clone... I entrust you with
this message from the Five Kage.

523
00:39:12,197 --> 00:39:13,100
We will win!

524
00:39:24,398 --> 00:39:25,154
<i>Yeah!</i>

525
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,741
We'll win!

526
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,904
Chill out, Naruto...
You fool, ya fool.

527
00:41:30,689 --> 00:41:32,483
Damn, it's so hard.

528
00:41:33,045 --> 00:41:34,422
I couldn't even put a crack in it.

529
00:41:34,844 --> 00:41:36,637
<i>I could've let him pass
through me...</i>

530
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:40,498
<i>But to think he couldn't even
scratch this mask.</i>

531
00:41:41,731 --> 00:41:44,734
<i>I hope that's not all the power
you can muster</i>

532
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:48,380
<i>to control the Nine-Tails...</i>

<i>Lava Style:
Scorching Rocks Jutsu!</i>

534
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,179

00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:05,681
<i>Water Style:</i>

536
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,233
<i>Aqua Mirror Jutsu!</i>

537
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,281
<i>These guys...</i>

538
00:42:15,148 --> 00:42:16,358
<i>... have the same power...!</i>

539
00:42:31,529 --> 00:42:33,049
This chakra...

540
00:42:34,171 --> 00:42:37,665
Utakata, you were a Jinchuriki?

541
00:42:39,008 --> 00:42:40,262
You too, huh?

542
00:42:41,315 --> 00:42:44,969
I heard rumors that
you had gone missing.

543
00:42:45,708 --> 00:42:47,526
So the Akatsuki got you...

544
00:42:48,054 --> 00:42:48,948
Yeah...

545
00:42:49,603 --> 00:42:53,656
After I left you guys,
they were lying in wait for me.

546
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:57,618
Why did you go into
the forest alone?!

547
00:42:57,898 --> 00:42:59,898
If you had escaped with Hotaru,
you'd still be—

548
00:42:59,938 --> 00:43:02,366
The Shinobi Tracking Unit from
the village was in the forest.

549
00:43:02,779 --> 00:43:04,579
I grew tired of running.

550
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:09,259
I wanted to reconcile with
the village and live in peace.

551
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:16,533
I wanted to stop living like a fugitive.

552
00:43:18,044 --> 00:43:21,670
And I wanted to spare Hotaru
a life constantly on the run.

553
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:24,956
Utakata, you...

554
00:43:25,916 --> 00:43:28,443
I wonder why I started
feeling that way?

555
00:43:28,783 --> 00:43:31,240
Why did I wish for such a dream?

556
00:43:32,278 --> 00:43:35,416
Well, it's all meaningless now.

557
00:43:37,331 --> 00:43:41,558
I convinced myself that the master
I trusted had betrayed me.

558
00:43:41,864 --> 00:43:44,416
And so, I closed off my heart.

559
00:43:44,614 --> 00:43:47,014
I didn't know how to trust people.

560
00:43:47,646 --> 00:43:51,926
And yet, Hotaru put her faith
in someone like me.

561
00:43:53,179 --> 00:43:56,635
Hotaru was also burdened with
a fate she hid from others.

562
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:59,753
The same way we Jinchuriki are.

563
00:44:01,068 --> 00:44:05,634
Maybe she sensed that
you and she were alike?

564
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:14,030
You have the will to
take yourself back.

565
00:44:14,445 --> 00:44:15,918
This is a meaningless fight.

566
00:44:15,943 --> 00:44:16,923
Naruto...

567
00:44:18,745 --> 00:44:23,092
I don't know if it's because of
these circumstances or not, but...

568
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:26,210
I was able to tell you
my true feelings.

569
00:44:26,402 --> 00:44:27,140
Thank you...

570
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:34,480
Naruto!

571
00:44:36,447 --> 00:44:38,533
<i>Water Style: Bubble Jutsu!</i>

572
00:44:44,603 --> 00:44:46,646
Sorry, Octopops!

573
00:44:51,298 --> 00:44:52,257
<i>Secret Tradition...</i>

574
00:44:52,463 --> 00:44:54,423
<i>Scaled Sneak Jutsu.</i>

575
00:45:03,957 --> 00:45:06,835
My shades are the best!
This light won't put my eyes to the test!

576
00:45:06,978 --> 00:45:09,367
I can still see through their evil intent!

577
00:45:13,584 --> 00:45:15,487
<i>Wasn't that Yugito just now?</i>

578
00:45:15,949 --> 00:45:18,410
<i>These guys are former Jinchuriki.</i>

579
00:45:19,045 --> 00:45:21,339
<i>On top of that, each of them</i>

580
00:45:21,715 --> 00:45:23,744
<i>has a Sharingan in one eye
and a Rinnegan in the other.</i>

581
00:45:24,511 --> 00:45:27,306
<i>Not only did they lose their lives,</i>

582
00:45:27,331 --> 00:45:29,725
<i>their eyes were turned into
those disgusting things.</i>

583
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:31,419
<i>Poor Yugito...</i>

584
00:45:33,129 --> 00:45:37,300
<i>This could have easily
happened to you.</i>

585
00:45:37,396 --> 00:45:38,481
<i>This is no joke.</i>

586
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:41,904
Seeing them change
fills me with grief...

587
00:45:41,929 --> 00:45:44,724
But keeping my own eyes
is a huge relief!

588
00:45:44,765 --> 00:45:46,893
<i>You hide yours behind
shades anyway.</i>

589
00:45:47,351 --> 00:45:49,937
<i>If you don't want to end up like that,
don't let your guard down!</i>

590
00:45:50,534 --> 00:45:52,913
Madara's eyes are the same.

591
00:45:53,738 --> 00:45:55,482
His mask's different from
the one he used to wear before.

592
00:45:55,507 --> 00:45:56,800
It's got two openings!

593
00:45:57,778 --> 00:46:00,948
Unlike the previous one,
this mask was specially made.

594
00:46:01,418 --> 00:46:03,170
It's battle-grade tough.

595
00:46:03,974 --> 00:46:08,197
So the left eye you always kept hidden
was a Rinnegan,

596
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:10,333
just like Nagato and
that other Madara.

597
00:46:12,184 --> 00:46:15,396
We're going to stop both you Madaras!

598
00:46:16,589 --> 00:46:19,174
Did you just say "both"?

599
00:46:20,854 --> 00:46:22,606
<i>Summoning Jutsu:
Reanimation.</i>

600
00:46:33,216 --> 00:46:35,343
<i>Yes. You can't refuse me.</i>

601
00:46:36,088 --> 00:46:37,011
<i>Why you...</i>

602
00:46:37,665 --> 00:46:39,416
<i>Where did you get that?</i>

603
00:46:40,432 --> 00:46:41,683
<i>Don't worry.</i>

604
00:46:42,281 --> 00:46:44,075
<i>I haven't told anyone about this.</i>

605
00:46:48,901 --> 00:46:50,236
<i>Damn that Kabuto...</i>

606
00:46:51,332 --> 00:46:54,126
Whaddya mean by "both," fool?

607
00:46:54,151 --> 00:46:56,779
Isn't this Madara, ya fool?

608
00:47:01,169 --> 00:47:03,489
Well then, I don't mind using
my previous name, Tobi.

609
00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:08,009
Now that the war's begun,
names don't matter.

610
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:12,879
Madara... Tobi...
Call me what you like.

611
00:47:14,455 --> 00:47:18,250
Just who are you anyway?

612
00:47:18,948 --> 00:47:22,368
I'm no one. I don't want to be anyone.

613
00:47:23,022 --> 00:47:26,942
All I want... is the success of
Project Tsuki no Me, that's all.

614
00:47:28,094 --> 00:47:31,639
You Jinchuriki had Tailed Beasts
forced into you

615
00:47:31,664 --> 00:47:33,457
and you've only experienced despair.

616
00:47:33,482 --> 00:47:34,483
Am I wrong?

617
00:47:34,998 --> 00:47:39,878
Surely, you can understand
a little of my despair.

618
00:47:42,054 --> 00:47:44,136
Who the hell are you to decide...

619
00:47:47,326 --> 00:47:50,800
that having a Tailed Beast in me
makes me unhappy?!

620
00:47:58,357 --> 00:48:01,402
Even if this world is worthless to you,

621
00:48:01,855 --> 00:48:05,108
you really think you can get away
with starting a war

622
00:48:05,239 --> 00:48:08,451
and trying to say that you're a nobody?

623
00:48:12,163 --> 00:48:13,622
You piss me off.

624
00:48:15,249 --> 00:48:18,252
I'm going to rip that mask off of you!

625
00:48:18,544 --> 00:48:21,881
I'll go first! Wheee!

626
00:48:22,923 --> 00:48:25,051
Taking this mask off of me...

627
00:48:32,016 --> 00:48:33,785
won't be so easy.

628
00:48:42,479 --> 00:48:44,368
Eight-Tails... Nine-Tails...

629
00:48:45,539 --> 00:48:47,674
You shall be mine...

630
00:48:48,746 --> 00:48:50,957
and I'll achieve
Project Tsuki no Me!

631
00:48:56,017 --> 00:48:58,937
We're not going to let
you have Nine-Tails or Eight-Tails!

632
00:48:59,293 --> 00:49:00,552
What's going on?

633
00:49:01,045 --> 00:49:03,255
I thought their Tailed Beasts
were extracted from them?!

634
00:49:04,035 --> 00:49:06,300
<i>They were probably made back
into Jinchuriki</i>

635
00:49:06,414 --> 00:49:08,666
<i>after they were reanimated...</i>

636
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:10,805
<i>I can also sense that</i>

637
00:49:10,846 --> 00:49:13,224
<i>the Tailed Beasts are
a bit different from before too...</i>

638
00:49:13,808 --> 00:49:15,101
<i>Be careful!</i>

639
00:49:18,432 --> 00:49:21,774
You too? Getting bad vibes?

640
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:24,104
Have to be careful with our lives

641
00:49:27,863 --> 00:49:31,656
Samehada is ready to fight
That's fine with me...

642
00:49:31,873 --> 00:49:35,371
'Cuz I'm raring to go...
Are ya ready?

643
00:49:35,788 --> 00:49:37,802
Hold it, Octopops!

644
00:49:40,876 --> 00:49:42,044
<i>Nice moves...</i>

645
00:49:47,312 --> 00:49:50,158
OK! She didn't see my... KO!

646
00:49:58,187 --> 00:50:01,524
<i>You didn't even see me,
so how'd you dodge?! Fool, ya fool!</i>

647
00:50:02,017 --> 00:50:04,061
That's not going to work, Octopops!

648
00:50:04,677 --> 00:50:07,263
It's just like the time
I fought the Six Paths of Pain.

649
00:50:07,778 --> 00:50:09,091
Their eyes...

650
00:50:09,159 --> 00:50:11,745
Their Rinnegan are all linked.
They're hooked up to each other!

651
00:50:11,991 --> 00:50:13,284
What the hell does that mean?!

652
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:15,842
It's the same as
Nagato's Gedo Jutsu!

653
00:50:16,912 --> 00:50:18,956
So they've got the eyesight...

654
00:50:18,998 --> 00:50:20,374
of six guys!

655
00:50:20,532 --> 00:50:22,143
<i>Damn, I can't even talk...!</i>

656
00:50:22,168 --> 00:50:22,976
<i>Hot!</i>

657
00:50:25,153 --> 00:50:26,992
<i>Aw man!
It's Yugito's Mouse Hairball!</i>

658
00:50:30,301 --> 00:50:31,468
It's coming after us!

659
00:50:32,001 --> 00:50:33,378
It's like a guided missile

660
00:50:33,425 --> 00:50:35,219
Time to run, let's hustle

661
00:50:42,587 --> 00:50:45,494
<i>Yugito's moves are different
from before...</i>

662
00:50:46,597 --> 00:50:49,990
<i>Half left of my expensive scarf...
What a surprise</i>

663
00:50:50,015 --> 00:50:51,808
<i>Now it's only worth half the price</i>

664
00:50:58,067 --> 00:50:59,276
<i>It's that Sharingan!</i>

665
00:51:00,495 --> 00:51:03,028
<i>That's how they're able
to track us so closely!</i>

666
00:51:03,667 --> 00:51:08,713
<i>Their Visual Prowess is
enhancing their Jinchuriki abilities!</i>

667
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:11,967
<i>On top of that,
with their shared vision,</i>

668
00:51:12,009 --> 00:51:14,136
<i>the six Jinchuriki can
position themselves</i>

669
00:51:14,178 --> 00:51:17,139
<i>and time their attacks
with more precision.</i>

670
00:51:18,807 --> 00:51:20,809
<i>Bee! Let me talk to Naruto!</i>

671
00:51:21,894 --> 00:51:22,814
Yo!

672
00:51:25,759 --> 00:51:28,692
<i>Naruto... They're cleverly combining</i>

673
00:51:28,734 --> 00:51:31,362
<i>the two types of Visual Prowess
and their Jinchuriki abilities.</i>

674
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:33,530
<i>They're probably on to us too.</i>

675
00:51:33,822 --> 00:51:34,823
<i>What do we do?</i>

676
00:51:36,075 --> 00:51:37,785
<i>We have no choice</i>

677
00:51:37,826 --> 00:51:39,828
<i>but to take down
six Jinchuriki one by one!</i>

678
00:51:40,332 --> 00:51:42,182
<i>If it's the same as
that time with Nagato,</i>

679
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:44,155
<i>they're all controlled by chakra.</i>

680
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,254
<i>Back then, in order to get chakra,</i>

681
00:51:48,557 --> 00:51:51,799
<i>black receivers were stuck
to their bodies.</i>

682
00:51:55,648 --> 00:52:00,099
<i>I see...
If we remove it or destroy it...</i>

683
00:52:00,411 --> 00:52:02,601
<i>the Gedo Jutsu would be broken.</i>

684
00:52:04,005 --> 00:52:05,882
<i>But that's going to be
a problem.</i>

685
00:52:06,212 --> 00:52:08,840
<i>It's hard enough landing
a blow on them.</i>

686
00:52:09,641 --> 00:52:14,270
<i>And we can't even pinpoint
where these black receivers are.</i>

687
00:52:15,114 --> 00:52:16,198
You mean, that thing?

688
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:16,927
<i>Huh?</i>

689
00:52:17,669 --> 00:52:18,534
<i>Where?!</i>

690
00:52:19,351 --> 00:52:25,980
Take a close look at Yugito's chest
and you'll see that black protrusion

691
00:52:26,005 --> 00:52:27,404
At first, I thought it was her ni—!

692
00:52:31,244 --> 00:52:32,933
<i>When they're flaunted,
it's unappealing</i>

693
00:52:32,958 --> 00:52:35,127
<i>But just a little glimpse,
it's a good feeling</i>

694
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:39,643
<i>This battle is going to
determine the future.</i>

695
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,051
<i>And you're only thinking about...</i>

696
00:52:41,682 --> 00:52:42,766
That's it!

697
00:52:43,576 --> 00:52:46,120
I'm going to go check out
the others.

698
00:52:46,306 --> 00:52:47,765
<i>Wait, Naruto!</i>

699
00:52:49,815 --> 00:52:53,166
<i>Our attacks don't work,
and we can't catch them...</i>

700
00:52:57,656 --> 00:52:58,240
<i>Hot!</i>

701
00:52:58,282 --> 00:53:00,826
<i>I'll just have to put up
with their attacks and grab them!</i>

702
00:53:02,536 --> 00:53:03,746
<i>Rasengan!</i>

703
00:53:07,207 --> 00:53:08,709
<i>I knew it was here!</i>

704
00:53:14,465 --> 00:53:16,216
<i>Then... I'll just...!</i>

705
00:53:35,944 --> 00:53:37,863
<i>Are you two all right?</i>

706
00:53:38,447 --> 00:53:39,615
Ouch...

707
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,703
<i>Bee... We're at a disadvantage
fighting them in the woods.</i>

708
00:53:44,958 --> 00:53:47,586
<i>Your field of vision is narrowed!</i>

709
00:53:48,389 --> 00:53:49,891
<i>You get me, don't you, Bee?!</i>

710
00:53:50,084 --> 00:53:52,169
<i>Oh... yeah...</i>

711
00:53:56,172 --> 00:53:58,883
<i>Blow up the entire forest!</i>

712
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:03,541
I'm Killer Bee and
Eight-Tails is here with me!

713
00:54:03,639 --> 00:54:06,725
Wheee!

714
00:54:08,852 --> 00:54:13,315
Don't fall off of me, Naruto.
'Cause now, the real fight's a go!

715
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:28,124
<i>Eight-Tailed Beast Twister!</i>

716
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:42,928
It seems Lord Bee has undergone

717
00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:44,680
the Tailed Beast
transformation already!

718
00:54:44,721 --> 00:54:47,099
I sense the immense chakra
of the Eight-Tails!

719
00:54:47,561 --> 00:54:50,063
It feels like they're on
the defensive!

720
00:54:50,891 --> 00:54:53,268
Things aren't looking
too good, are they?

721
00:54:53,731 --> 00:54:54,609
Frankly...

722
00:54:55,387 --> 00:54:58,098
However, the Five Kage
have Madara on the defensive!

723
00:54:58,652 --> 00:55:00,320
We're doing okay for now!

724
00:55:01,029 --> 00:55:02,865
The Five Kage are working together.

725
00:55:03,309 --> 00:55:04,977
They have to have the edge!

726
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,221
What's the status of each company?!

727
00:55:07,995 --> 00:55:09,455
The First and Second Companies

728
00:55:09,496 --> 00:55:10,747
are on the verge of
annihilating the enemy.

729
00:55:11,081 --> 00:55:14,126
The Third Company is down
to two Reanimations.

730
00:55:14,585 --> 00:55:16,342
Out of all the Seven
Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist,

731
00:55:16,367 --> 00:55:18,475
only Mangetsu Hozuki is left.

732
00:55:18,672 --> 00:55:21,300
It appears the Fifth Company
needs a little more time...

733
00:55:22,092 --> 00:55:24,470
But there's no doubt that
they have the upper hand!

734
00:55:24,636 --> 00:55:25,721
All right!

735
00:55:25,762 --> 00:55:28,474
Tell the First, Second, Third
and Fifth Companies

736
00:55:28,515 --> 00:55:29,725
as soon as they wrap up...

737
00:55:29,766 --> 00:55:33,812
They are to head over to
assist Naruto and Lord Bee!

738
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:35,891
What are their coordinates, Lord Ao?

739
00:55:36,993 --> 00:55:38,995
W-Wow...

740
00:55:48,607 --> 00:55:51,026
<i>Seal them now, Bee!</i>

741
00:55:51,574 --> 00:55:54,160
<i>Sealing Jutsu: Octopus Hold!</i>

742
00:56:06,772 --> 00:56:07,857
So that's it!

743
00:56:08,596 --> 00:56:10,557
<i>It's only one of Bee's Sealing Jutsu!</i>

744
00:56:10,807 --> 00:56:12,392
<i>Just like that and on
a count of three...</i>

745
00:56:12,417 --> 00:56:13,591
<i>Basically, in three seconds,</i>

746
00:56:13,616 --> 00:56:15,784
<i>the ink will completely cover
their bodies and harden,</i>

747
00:56:16,146 --> 00:56:17,814
<i>incapacitating them!</i>

748
00:56:18,776 --> 00:56:21,696
<i>Once they're immobile,
we can remove the rods from their chest!</i>

749
00:56:22,924 --> 00:56:24,231
– One!
– <i>One!</i>

750
00:56:25,614 --> 00:56:26,823
– Two!
– <i>Two!</i>

751
00:56:27,822 --> 00:56:29,032
– Three!
– <i>Three!</i>

752
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:37,627
Go...

753
00:56:38,335 --> 00:56:39,887
That masked bastard!

754
00:56:40,028 --> 00:56:41,822
He was hiding underground!

755
00:56:54,101 --> 00:56:55,185
<i>Bug Bite!</i>

756
00:56:55,686 --> 00:56:56,937
<i>Cat Claws!</i>

757
00:57:00,482 --> 00:57:01,483
<i>Leech Slip!</i>

758
00:57:01,608 --> 00:57:02,609
Oww!

759
00:57:02,859 --> 00:57:05,487
<i>It's a strong alkaline fluid!
Your skin's melting!</i>

760
00:57:06,697 --> 00:57:07,698
Octopops!

761
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:08,991
<i>Coral Palm!</i>

762
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,203
What the hell...?!

763
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:14,515
<i>Naruto!</i>

764
00:57:17,037 --> 00:57:18,163
<i>Floral Mountain!</i>

765
00:57:24,339 --> 00:57:25,340
<i>This is bad!</i>

766
00:57:25,538 --> 00:57:27,255
<i>I didn't realize that
these guys could transform</i>

767
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,366
<i>into Tailed Beasts
just like that!</i>

768
00:57:29,797 --> 00:57:32,759
<i>Naruto, retreat for now.
We need to regroup!</i>

769
00:57:34,466 --> 00:57:35,697
<i>Horn Hit!</i>

770
00:57:51,992 --> 00:57:53,410
<i>I can't move...!</i>

771
00:57:54,547 --> 00:57:55,714
Bastard!

772
00:57:57,017 --> 00:57:58,643
Even if you're Jinchuriki,

773
00:57:58,668 --> 00:58:00,795
six against two appears
to be bad odds, huh?

774
00:58:03,211 --> 00:58:05,756
When I touch you, I win!

775
00:58:08,575 --> 00:58:09,331
This isn't good!

776
00:58:13,263 --> 00:58:16,433
<i>Violent... Leaf Superhuman Hurricane!</i>

777
00:58:33,761 --> 00:58:35,677
<i>Using Naruto as bait,</i>

778
00:58:35,702 --> 00:58:38,449
<i>they waited for the moment
I materialized...</i>

779
00:58:39,206 --> 00:58:40,916
<i>What a nuisance!</i>

780
00:58:41,708 --> 00:58:44,336
Kakashi-sensei and Bushier Brow-sensei!

781
00:58:50,959 --> 00:58:53,712
Two more joining the party isn't going
to change anything.

782
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:58,269
Not against my Visual Prowess
and power of the Tailed Beasts.

783
00:59:00,258 --> 00:59:02,176
We have Sharingan on our side too.

784
00:59:02,938 --> 00:59:06,692
As well as the Noble Green Beast
of the Leaf!

785
00:59:11,947 --> 00:59:15,575
You came, Kakashi-sensei!
Bushier Brow-sensei!

786
00:59:16,535 --> 00:59:19,830
You know I can't just sit back
and relax

787
00:59:19,913 --> 00:59:22,082
while my student from Team 7
is working hard!

788
00:59:24,562 --> 00:59:26,731
Oh! Him! He's got a Sharingan

789
00:59:26,878 --> 00:59:29,715
and a Rinnegan that are linked,
left eye to right eye... and...!

790
00:59:29,756 --> 00:59:32,718
And there's a rod sticking out of
the left side of the chest... and...!

791
00:59:32,759 --> 00:59:35,262
Calm down.
You're not making sense.

792
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,375
The right eye is Sharingan.

793
00:59:37,697 --> 00:59:38,823
The left eye is Rinnegan.

794
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,487
And he has the same rod
Pain had in his left chest.

795
00:59:42,099 --> 00:59:42,957
So I see.

796
00:59:43,178 --> 00:59:44,502
Have to hand it to you, Kakashi.

797
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:46,375
Your skills of deduction
are impressive!

798
00:59:47,577 --> 00:59:48,288
Here it comes!

799
00:59:49,072 --> 00:59:50,461
From the number of tails...
It's Five-Tails!

800
00:59:51,981 --> 00:59:53,816
<i>Leaf Rock Crush!</i>

801
00:59:55,264 --> 00:59:57,099
Hey, thanks!

802
01:00:00,954 --> 01:00:02,038
<i>He's after the Eight-Tails!</i>

803
01:00:02,847 --> 01:00:05,392
Sorry, Eight-o! You okay?

804
01:00:05,834 --> 01:00:07,711
<i>We share pain, remember?</i>

805
01:00:07,711 --> 01:00:09,713
<i>What about you? You okay, Bee?</i>

806
01:00:16,032 --> 01:00:18,618
<i>He tried to attack him?</i>

807
01:00:24,667 --> 01:00:25,918
<i>So painful...!</i>

808
01:00:26,454 --> 01:00:27,046
Huh?!

809
01:00:27,528 --> 01:00:31,449
<i>How can I let a bastard
like him do this to me...?</i>

810
01:00:34,724 --> 01:00:35,388
Why you...!

811
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:39,356
There! He did it!

812
01:00:47,423 --> 01:00:49,384
Why would he suppress
the Tailed Beast's powers?

813
01:00:50,003 --> 01:00:51,004
I don't know...

814
01:00:51,376 --> 01:00:53,211
He doesn't seem to
have the Tailed Beast

815
01:00:53,236 --> 01:00:54,404
completely under his control.

816
01:00:54,966 --> 01:00:56,092
Maybe that's why...

817
01:01:02,791 --> 01:01:05,919
Hey, did you hear
that voice, Naruto?

818
01:01:06,686 --> 01:01:07,462
I heard it.

819
01:01:08,438 --> 01:01:11,399
<i>That was the Tailed Beast...
Five-Tails' voice.</i>

820
01:01:15,681 --> 01:01:18,476
<i>We Tailed Beasts have emotions.</i>

821
01:01:18,946 --> 01:01:22,574
<i>It pisses me off to see one of
my kind treated like that!</i>

822
01:01:22,869 --> 01:01:23,486
Ouch!

823
01:01:24,018 --> 01:01:26,437
<i>Now you get mad?</i>

824
01:01:27,143 --> 01:01:32,045
<i>It's always been the same with
every shinobi who has kept us as pets!</i>

825
01:01:32,668 --> 01:01:37,589
<i>Eight-Tails... You and that brat Bee
are a special exception.</i>

826
01:01:38,844 --> 01:01:41,222
<i>I wonder about that Nine-Tails...</i>

827
01:01:41,638 --> 01:01:42,302
Huh?

828
01:01:42,419 --> 01:01:44,754
Nine-Tails can talk to Eight-Tails?

829
01:01:45,516 --> 01:01:47,648
<i>I know all about it, Nine-Tails.</i>

830
01:01:48,353 --> 01:01:50,647
– <i>You...</i>
– <i>You talk too much!</i>

831
01:01:51,189 --> 01:01:54,397
<i>By the way, Eight-Tails, given
the number of tails you have,</i>

832
01:01:54,422 --> 01:01:56,216
<i>aren't you the next
most powerful after me?</i>

833
01:01:56,811 --> 01:01:58,433
<i>Hurry up and finish this!</i>

834
01:01:59,137 --> 01:02:01,283
<i>I'm going to take a nap!</i>

835
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:05,620
<i>Don't decide who's stronger
based on the tail count!</i>

836
01:02:05,878 --> 01:02:07,671
<i>You've always been like this!</i>

837
01:02:08,117 --> 01:02:11,078
<i>That's why that Tanuki
One Tail really hates you!</i>

838
01:02:11,746 --> 01:02:14,040
<i>Are you even listening, you fool?!</i>

839
01:02:14,521 --> 01:02:16,898
<i>Don't you dare play possum,
you fox!</i>

840
01:02:19,865 --> 01:02:21,826
Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails
are arguing...

841
01:02:22,253 --> 01:02:24,906
Through telepathy
the Tailed Beasts speak...

842
01:02:25,076 --> 01:02:27,370
It's not only rare,
but an amazing feat!

843
01:02:29,269 --> 01:02:31,646
What are you mumbling about,
Naruto?!

844
01:02:32,328 --> 01:02:33,329
The enemy's approaching!

845
01:02:33,675 --> 01:02:35,510
Just because I'm here, it doesn't
mean you can breathe easy!

846
01:02:35,535 --> 01:02:36,170
Right!

847
01:02:36,779 --> 01:02:39,321
We need to confirm which one uses
which of Pain's jutsu!

848
01:02:39,551 --> 01:02:40,677
Got it, Guy?

849
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:43,239
I'm not good at
remembering faces...

850
01:02:43,511 --> 01:02:45,513
And they all look the same to me...

851
01:02:46,927 --> 01:02:47,650
<i>Lightning Blade!</i>

852
01:02:47,953 --> 01:02:48,933
<i>Eight Inner Gates!</i>

853
01:02:49,247 --> 01:02:50,829
<i>Sixth Gate of Joy, Open!</i>

854
01:02:57,339 --> 01:02:59,257
Three are headed your way, Naruto!

855
01:02:59,772 --> 01:03:00,719
They're here!

856
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:03,272
Three is better than what
we faced before...

857
01:03:03,470 --> 01:03:05,722
I'm serious now too, hard core!

858
01:03:12,854 --> 01:03:13,980
<i>Chakra Absorption...</i>

859
01:03:14,308 --> 01:03:15,309
<i>Summoning...</i>

860
01:03:15,433 --> 01:03:16,726
<i>Magnetic Pull and Repulsion...</i>

861
01:03:16,830 --> 01:03:17,956
<i>Chakra Extraction...</i>

862
01:03:17,981 --> 01:03:18,982
<i>Puppetry...</i>

863
01:03:19,007 --> 01:03:20,008
<i>What's going on?</i>

864
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,738
<i>They're not using any of those!</i>

865
01:03:25,619 --> 01:03:26,620
Why?!

866
01:03:26,782 --> 01:03:28,367
They're not using any
of Pain's jutsu!

867
01:03:28,906 --> 01:03:30,616
Maybe... they can't.

868
01:03:31,244 --> 01:03:35,165
Maybe he's shrewd enough
not to waste any chakra

869
01:03:35,251 --> 01:03:39,297
on Pain's jutsu since we already
know how to counter them!

870
01:03:40,215 --> 01:03:43,176
Yeah. In order to control
six Tailed Beasts

871
01:03:43,218 --> 01:03:44,970
with just his Visual Prowess,

872
01:03:45,011 --> 01:03:47,055
he must use an enormous amount
of chakra.

873
01:03:48,147 --> 01:03:49,982
Have to hand it to you,
Kakashi-sensei!

874
01:03:50,149 --> 01:03:52,151
There's your deductive skill again!

875
01:03:53,531 --> 01:03:54,949
<i>Kakashi Hatake...</i>

876
01:03:55,499 --> 01:03:57,961
<i>He's got very discerning eyes.</i>

877
01:03:58,991 --> 01:04:00,034
<i>Well then...</i>

878
01:04:00,402 --> 01:04:02,779
<i>I'll just power it up a little.</i>

879
01:04:10,058 --> 01:04:11,435
<i>Next up, two beasts.</i>

880
01:04:32,848 --> 01:04:33,685
Damn it!

881
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:36,291
I'll have to use Nine-Tails' Chakra
to make Shadow Clones for a diversion...

882
01:04:36,316 --> 01:04:38,569
and attack the masked guy head on!

883
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:41,711
You can't use anymore Nine-Tails'
chakra for Shadow Clones!

884
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:44,045
Nine-Tails will take
your own chakra...

885
01:04:44,070 --> 01:04:46,156
And you'll drop dead

886
01:04:46,469 --> 01:04:48,638
Then you'll be seeing red!

887
01:04:49,031 --> 01:04:51,487
<i>Bee, haven't you noticed yet?</i>

888
01:04:52,373 --> 01:04:54,375
<i>I thought you bumped fists
with him!</i>

889
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:56,303
<i>Given the number of clones
he's already produced,</i>

890
01:04:56,328 --> 01:04:58,205
<i>Naruto should have been
half-dead a while back.</i>

891
01:04:58,376 --> 01:05:02,380
<i>Seeing as he's not means that
Nine-Tails stopped taking</i>

892
01:05:02,422 --> 01:05:04,382
<i>Naruto's chakra sometime ago.</i>

893
01:05:05,784 --> 01:05:07,494
<i>Right, Nine-Tails?</i>

894
01:05:11,188 --> 01:05:13,857
<i>Although I don't know
what happened between you two...</i>

895
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:21,126
<i>You know, Nine-Tails...</i>

896
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:28,907
<i>I'm coming after all that hate
inside you, too, some day!</i>

897
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:33,177
<i>Who the hell are you to decide...</i>

898
01:05:33,202 --> 01:05:36,881
<i>that having a Tailed Beast
inside me makes me unhappy?!</i>

899
01:05:44,178 --> 01:05:45,346
What the hell is that?!

900
01:05:45,715 --> 01:05:47,509
Whatever you do,
don't let it touch you, Guy!

901
01:06:24,295 --> 01:06:25,138
Naruto!

902
01:06:25,508 --> 01:06:26,298
We have to help him!

903
01:06:26,506 --> 01:06:27,927
Guy, we have to deal
with this side first!

904
01:06:28,383 --> 01:06:30,009
This is bad too!

905
01:06:31,261 --> 01:06:31,959
We're being surrounded!

906
01:06:42,546 --> 01:06:43,798
The tree wilted instantly!

907
01:06:44,274 --> 01:06:45,817
Is it a corrosive gas?

908
01:06:46,312 --> 01:06:48,820
<i>I'm worried about how much chakra
I have left, but I have no choice.</i>

909
01:06:49,765 --> 01:06:50,766
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

910
01:06:52,715 --> 01:06:53,296
Guy...

911
01:06:53,741 --> 01:06:55,410
We have to guard
each other's back

912
01:06:55,451 --> 01:06:56,769
and focus only on
what's in front of us.

913
01:06:56,794 --> 01:06:57,670
Any complaints?!

914
01:06:57,695 --> 01:06:58,696
Nope!

915
01:07:03,484 --> 01:07:04,296
<i>Lightning Cable!</i>

916
01:07:05,433 --> 01:07:07,518
<i>Sixth Gate of Joy, Open!</i>

917
01:07:07,817 --> 01:07:09,235
<i>Asakujaku!</i>

918
01:07:18,641 --> 01:07:19,684
Here comes the next wave!

919
01:07:20,501 --> 01:07:21,502
Same here!

920
01:07:21,914 --> 01:07:24,570
Let's wrap this up and help Naruto!

921
01:07:32,655 --> 01:07:35,283
Let Naruto go, you monkey!

922
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:42,040
<i>Nine-Tails...</i>

923
01:07:42,123 --> 01:07:45,126
<i>I think you gave some
of your chakra</i>

924
01:07:45,168 --> 01:07:47,795
<i>to the Naruto's clone who was
fighting the other Madara.</i>

925
01:07:48,087 --> 01:07:52,926
<i>You should lend this one
strength too before it's too late.</i>

926
01:07:53,575 --> 01:07:56,203
<i>I'm not like you, Eight-Tails.</i>

927
01:07:56,951 --> 01:08:01,956
<i>I won't wag my tails each and
every time for my Jinchuriki...</i>

928
01:08:02,759 --> 01:08:05,554
<i>Don't you care what happens
to Naruto?!</i>

929
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:14,947
Nine-Tails...

930
01:08:15,816 --> 01:08:19,861
Your current form is nothing more
than a momentary construct...

931
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:23,039
You're merely a fragment of power.

932
01:08:23,712 --> 01:08:24,762
<i>Shut up.</i>

933
01:08:25,698 --> 01:08:29,159
You are just an ignorant
unstable power...

934
01:08:29,963 --> 01:08:31,381
<i>Shut up.</i>

935
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:36,094
Those who shall guide
you are the Uchiha.

936
01:08:36,655 --> 01:08:39,784
You Tailed Beasts are simply
servants of those with Visual Prowess!

937
01:08:40,028 --> 01:08:41,446
<i>Shut the hell up!</i>

938
01:08:43,584 --> 01:08:44,618
Obey!

939
01:08:47,591 --> 01:08:48,717
Nine-Tails...

940
01:08:49,193 --> 01:08:51,445
Your power is too great.

941
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,967
Regrettably, I cannot
let you run loose.

942
01:08:55,875 --> 01:08:58,252
<i>No matter what words they use...</i>

943
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:02,837
When you exert your power,
you draw hatred to you.

944
01:09:03,765 --> 01:09:05,725
Please stay quiet inside me.

945
01:09:08,778 --> 01:09:11,072
<i>Humans all say...</i>

946
01:09:13,131 --> 01:09:16,718
This is unfortunate for both of us...

947
01:09:17,302 --> 01:09:19,632
You may be here to keep
the world in check,

948
01:09:19,657 --> 01:09:21,868
but I'm here to watch you.

949
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:26,311
<i>... the same thing.</i>

950
01:09:29,689 --> 01:09:31,774
<i>And now, it's this brat?</i>

951
01:09:31,919 --> 01:09:33,295
<i>How dare these shinobi...</i>

952
01:09:33,749 --> 01:09:35,667
<i>I'll bet even he...</i>

953
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:38,800
You know, Nine-Tails...

954
01:09:39,932 --> 01:09:46,258
I'm coming after all that hate
inside you, too, some day!

955
01:09:55,889 --> 01:09:57,057
Naruto!

956
01:10:05,516 --> 01:10:06,517
What the—?!

957
01:10:06,651 --> 01:10:10,071
<i>Now you want to take my power too?</i>

958
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:14,876
<i>Coming all the way in here...
you obnoxious brat!</i>

959
01:10:15,109 --> 01:10:16,694
A-Are you...

960
01:10:17,111 --> 01:10:18,002
Four-Tails?!

961
01:10:18,027 --> 01:10:20,196
<i>Don't call me "Four-Tails"!</i>

962
01:10:20,810 --> 01:10:22,019
<i>I have a proper name!</i>

963
01:10:22,789 --> 01:10:24,958
<i>I am the handsome
Monkey King of Suirendo,</i>

964
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:26,788
<i>the King of Sage Monkeys,</i>

965
01:10:26,788 --> 01:10:28,768
<i>bestowed with
the priestly title "Son"</i>

966
01:10:28,793 --> 01:10:29,878
<i>from the Sage of Six Paths!</i>

967
01:10:30,262 --> 01:10:33,094
<i>The Great Sage
Equalling Heaven, Son Goku!</i>

968
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:41,196
Huh? Uh...
Which one's your name?

969
01:10:42,263 --> 01:10:43,764
<i>It's Son Goku!</i>

970
01:10:45,014 --> 01:10:47,225
<i>You humans are all stupid!</i>

971
01:10:47,577 --> 01:10:49,329
<i>You can't even get
a name straight!</i>

972
01:10:49,613 --> 01:10:50,781
<i>You are all lesser than apes.</i>

973
01:10:51,312 --> 01:10:53,940
<i>I don't want to give my power
to likes of such...</i>

974
01:10:54,390 --> 01:10:55,557
So where are we?

975
01:10:55,638 --> 01:10:56,931
It sorta looks like
Nine-Tails' place...

976
01:10:57,151 --> 01:10:58,736
<i>Did you hear me, kid?!</i>

977
01:10:59,028 --> 01:11:02,990
<i>I told you my name!
Don't you dare ignore me!</i>

978
01:11:03,324 --> 01:11:04,622
<i>You're so rude!</i>

979
01:11:04,647 --> 01:11:06,190
Huh? Oh...

980
01:11:07,308 --> 01:11:08,139
S-Sorry.

981
01:11:10,539 --> 01:11:14,293
<i>You're... pretty genuine for a human.</i>

982
01:11:14,746 --> 01:11:15,812
<i>It's the first time I've heard</i>

983
01:11:15,837 --> 01:11:17,713
<i>someone apologize to
a Tailed Beast.</i>

984
01:11:18,659 --> 01:11:22,204
<i>I guess you didn't come to
steal my power, eh?</i>

985
01:11:25,691 --> 01:11:27,328
<i>You have one inside you too...</i>

986
01:11:28,429 --> 01:11:30,264
<i>That's how you got in...</i>

987
01:11:31,198 --> 01:11:34,159
<i>Kurama's trained
his Jinchuriki well.</i>

988
01:11:34,689 --> 01:11:35,690
Kurama?

989
01:11:36,576 --> 01:11:37,619
<i>Who's Kurama?</i>

990
01:11:38,473 --> 01:11:42,711
<i>How can you be the Nine-Tails' Jinchuriki
and not even know his real name?!</i>

991
01:11:43,542 --> 01:11:45,252
<i>That's why humans disgust me!</i>

992
01:11:45,730 --> 01:11:48,524
Huh?! The Nine-Tails
has a name too?!

993
01:11:51,121 --> 01:11:53,916
I see, his name's Kurama!

994
01:11:54,792 --> 01:11:58,963
<i>You humans only see us
as sources of power.</i>

995
01:11:59,288 --> 01:12:03,108
<i>You don't even care if we have
names, or care to know them.</i>

996
01:12:04,844 --> 01:12:08,598
<i>You imprison and deny us
of our existence.</i>

997
01:12:17,479 --> 01:12:19,418
Look, it's that boy.

998
01:12:19,758 --> 01:12:21,677
Ignore him and keep walking.

999
01:12:22,195 --> 01:12:23,321
Who's that boy?

1000
01:12:23,613 --> 01:12:24,947
You don't need to know.

1001
01:12:29,299 --> 01:12:32,427
I think I understand a little
about how you feel.

1002
01:12:33,054 --> 01:12:34,931
I used to misbehave a lot.

1003
01:12:35,917 --> 01:12:37,293
I just wanted to be scolded.

1004
01:12:39,092 --> 01:12:39,865
<i>Huh?</i>

1005
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:43,126
I'd do anything to get people
to notice me.

1006
01:12:43,841 --> 01:12:47,428
It was better than being invisible.

1007
01:12:47,970 --> 01:12:50,890
I'm a Jinchuriki...

1008
01:12:51,109 --> 01:12:54,487
But I have a proper name
I cherish... Naruto.

1009
01:12:55,057 --> 01:12:57,435
It's a memento from
my parents and master.

1010
01:13:01,492 --> 01:13:02,535
That's why...

1011
01:13:03,708 --> 01:13:07,253
<i>I'm no one.
I don't want to be anyone.</i>

1012
01:13:08,078 --> 01:13:11,999
<i>I just want to fulfill
Project Tsuki no Me.</i>

1013
01:13:12,505 --> 01:13:15,508
I can't stand a guy like that who
doesn't even care who he is...

1014
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:23,692
Well then, what do you
want to do with us?

1015
01:13:27,474 --> 01:13:28,934
Like Octopops...

1016
01:13:30,051 --> 01:13:33,346
I'd like to be like Octopops
and Eight-Tails.

1017
01:13:34,474 --> 01:13:35,475
<i>Huh?</i>

1018
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:40,122
When I watch him joke around
with Eight-Tails,

1019
01:13:40,147 --> 01:13:43,775
and fight, and console each other...

1020
01:13:43,901 --> 01:13:46,696
They're like friends.

1021
01:13:47,346 --> 01:13:50,933
And I always have this feeling...

1022
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,876
I... I really envy them.

1023
01:14:00,362 --> 01:14:01,530
<i>Aw c'mon! Don't tell me...</i>

1024
01:14:01,555 --> 01:14:05,628
<i>A human like you seriously wants
to be friends with a Tailed Beast?!</i>

1025
01:14:11,846 --> 01:14:12,515
<i>Huh?</i>

1026
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:21,021
<i>This guy...</i>

1027
01:14:22,217 --> 01:14:24,052
<i>He's dead serious...</i>

1028
01:14:29,761 --> 01:14:34,201
That's why I want to help
you too... Umm...

1029
01:14:34,669 --> 01:14:36,045
What was your name again?

1030
01:14:38,748 --> 01:14:39,915
<i>Just call me Son...</i>

1031
01:14:40,833 --> 01:14:44,003
<i>By the way, I ate you.
What are you going to do?</i>

1032
01:14:44,306 --> 01:14:48,269
Oh, yeah! What'll I do?!

1033
01:14:49,439 --> 01:14:50,607
Hmmm...

1034
01:14:54,055 --> 01:14:56,599
<i>He seems better than
the guy in the mask...</i>

1035
01:14:58,581 --> 01:15:00,583
<i>There is a way to stop me.</i>

1036
01:15:02,293 --> 01:15:06,506
<i>Undo these chains and you'll see.</i>

1037
01:15:08,611 --> 01:15:09,654
Son!

1038
01:15:10,171 --> 01:15:13,090
You have to tell me
how to stop you.

1039
01:15:13,866 --> 01:15:16,494
<i>First, just one thing...</i>

1040
01:15:18,329 --> 01:15:22,792
<i>I don't trust Jinchuriki on principle.</i>

1041
01:15:23,668 --> 01:15:25,961
<i>Especially fools like you</i>

1042
01:15:25,986 --> 01:15:28,655
<i>who claim they want to be friends
with Tailed Beasts.</i>

1043
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:30,591
<i>In other words...</i>

1044
01:15:31,128 --> 01:15:33,964
<i>Don't think that if you set me free,</i>

1045
01:15:34,428 --> 01:15:36,806
<i>I'll be your ally.</i>

1046
01:15:37,434 --> 01:15:38,769
<i>If you want our trust...</i>

1047
01:15:38,794 --> 01:15:40,087
It's fine.

1048
01:15:40,578 --> 01:15:43,623
I have a pretty good idea of
what I need to do anyway.

1049
01:15:48,918 --> 01:15:54,031
<i>Naruto... I've seen all
that you've done.</i>

1050
01:15:54,888 --> 01:15:57,785
<i>So you should know by now.</i>

1051
01:15:58,893 --> 01:16:03,022
<i>No matter what you say to me,
to us Tailed Beasts...</i>

1052
01:16:03,047 --> 01:16:04,924
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

1053
01:16:05,876 --> 01:16:08,295
<i>Your true feelings won't
be transmitted to us.</i>

1054
01:16:08,857 --> 01:16:12,903
Unlock the noose,
have to let Naruto loose

1055
01:16:15,019 --> 01:16:16,562
So you were here.

1056
01:16:17,672 --> 01:16:20,758
I'll drag both you and
Four-Tails into me.

1057
01:16:30,186 --> 01:16:31,187
This isn't good.

1058
01:16:31,694 --> 01:16:33,362
Open your mouth!

1059
01:16:33,446 --> 01:16:34,962
Naruto, get out!

1060
01:16:44,290 --> 01:16:45,583
I've got to get outta here!

1061
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:00,376
It's not opening.

1062
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:02,814
It's not going to work like this.

1063
01:17:03,843 --> 01:17:06,054
<i>Umm... umm...</i>

1064
01:17:06,256 --> 01:17:09,259
<i>I have to make him throw me up...</i>

1065
01:17:11,275 --> 01:17:12,276
Throw up...

1066
01:17:14,195 --> 01:17:15,613
From overeating...

1067
01:17:17,531 --> 01:17:19,700
<i>Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

1068
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:39,094
Didn't expect so many Naruto
on the plate

1069
01:17:39,136 --> 01:17:41,305
He's smart to make him regurgitate

1070
01:17:42,306 --> 01:17:44,683
All right! I made it out!

1071
01:17:45,790 --> 01:17:47,083
Now then...

1072
01:17:48,779 --> 01:17:52,241
<i>Listen! Take a good look
at the base of my neck.</i>

1073
01:17:52,650 --> 01:17:55,194
<i>There's a rod stuck into it.</i>

1074
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:58,966
<i>That's where the chakra
chain binds us.</i>

1075
01:17:59,922 --> 01:18:03,176
<i>It's the chain of the demon statue
that Rinnegan Gedo uses.</i>

1076
01:18:03,944 --> 01:18:05,821
<i>Huh? It's not on the chest?</i>

1077
01:18:06,271 --> 01:18:08,833
<i>The Jinchuriki had it
on their chests.</i>

1078
01:18:09,298 --> 01:18:11,306
<i>It's because we expand in size</i>

1079
01:18:11,331 --> 01:18:13,395
<i>when we undergo
Tailed Beast Transformation...</i>

1080
01:18:13,420 --> 01:18:16,215
<i>The rods migrate to
the base of our necks.</i>

1081
01:18:16,901 --> 01:18:19,445
<i>And being bigger makes it
difficult to find.</i>

1082
01:18:23,924 --> 01:18:25,834
You just don't know
when to give up...

1083
01:18:27,362 --> 01:18:29,748
<i>Just pull that rod out.</i>

1084
01:18:30,076 --> 01:18:33,079
<i>Then the chakra chain won't form!</i>

1085
01:18:33,371 --> 01:18:34,998
Damn, where is it?

1086
01:18:45,452 --> 01:18:47,788
Found it! That's it!

1087
01:18:49,214 --> 01:18:53,427
<i>And the chain binding me
should disappear.</i>

1088
01:18:53,669 --> 01:18:55,504
<i>But it won't be easy.</i>

1089
01:18:55,629 --> 01:18:58,590
<i>I'll be controlled and unable
to stop from attacking.</i>

1090
01:19:08,559 --> 01:19:10,144
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

1091
01:19:10,561 --> 01:19:14,481
<i>Things might get rough,
but you have to bear with me.</i>

1092
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:19,149
<i>Don't go overboard and
end up killing me!</i>

1093
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:35,461
<i>I can't keep up this mode
much longer.</i>

1094
01:19:35,794 --> 01:19:37,838
<i>I may as well just
push it to the limits!</i>

1095
01:19:50,267 --> 01:19:50,997
Here it is!

1096
01:19:52,541 --> 01:19:53,751
Do it, Naruto!

1097
01:19:54,730 --> 01:19:56,899
Why you—!

1098
01:20:00,577 --> 01:20:01,578
<i>It's working!</i>

1099
01:20:02,279 --> 01:20:03,572
Damn Naruto...

1100
01:20:08,505 --> 01:20:10,591
It's not going to go that easily.

1101
01:20:12,419 --> 01:20:14,213
What the hell is this...?

1102
01:20:15,323 --> 01:20:16,699
My power...

1103
01:20:17,488 --> 01:20:20,366
Those rods bind anything
that touches them.

1104
01:20:21,503 --> 01:20:25,507
They're stronger restraints than
Nagato, Pain's Gedo Powers!

1105
01:20:29,098 --> 01:20:30,112
Naruto!

1106
01:20:31,077 --> 01:20:32,704
One problem after another!

1107
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:46,824
<i>Ya know, Nine-Tails, I...</i>

1108
01:20:49,827 --> 01:20:54,720
<i>I'm going to come after all that
hate inside you as well some day!</i>

1109
01:20:56,425 --> 01:20:59,595
<i>That's why I want to help you too...</i>

1110
01:21:05,161 --> 01:21:06,173
<i>Naruto...</i>

1111
01:21:06,794 --> 01:21:09,488
<i>If you're absolutely serious and</i>

1112
01:21:09,513 --> 01:21:13,144
<i>truly wish to do something
for us Tailed Beasts,</i>

1113
01:21:13,856 --> 01:21:15,699
<i>keep doing what
you've been doing...</i>

1114
01:21:16,433 --> 01:21:17,494
<i>Not yet...</i>

1115
01:21:24,628 --> 01:21:25,341
All right!

1116
01:21:35,664 --> 01:21:38,375
<i>Hope you can sense this okay!</i>

1117
01:21:41,716 --> 01:21:44,427
<i>The real me is outside...
right about here.</i>

1118
01:21:45,215 --> 01:21:47,634
<i>I did warn you that
I might have to get rough.</i>

1119
01:21:47,676 --> 01:21:48,969
<i>Hope you understand.</i>

1120
01:21:49,845 --> 01:21:52,890
<i>We're going to push
the rod out from the inside!</i>

1121
01:21:54,149 --> 01:21:56,889
<i>Keeping doing what
you've been doing all along</i>

1122
01:21:56,914 --> 01:21:58,328
<i>and prove yourself
through your actions!</i>

1123
01:21:58,353 --> 01:22:01,401
<i>Naruto... That's who you are!</i>

1124
01:22:02,274 --> 01:22:03,776
<i>Frog Slap!</i>

1125
01:22:17,873 --> 01:22:18,957
It's loose!

1126
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:28,133
<i>That's right,
that's the Naruto I know.</i>

1127
01:22:33,869 --> 01:22:36,913
<i>Damned Naruto!
He pulled out the rod!</i>

1128
01:22:37,142 --> 01:22:37,948
<i>In that case...</i>

1129
01:22:42,147 --> 01:22:43,190
<i>Rasengan!</i>

1130
01:22:52,866 --> 01:22:55,035
<i>You did it!</i>

1131
01:22:57,855 --> 01:22:59,919
What?! Why are
the chains still here?!

1132
01:23:00,124 --> 01:23:03,710
<i>Heh... I guess this chain through
my stomach won't disappear...</i>

1133
01:23:03,743 --> 01:23:06,329
Why?! I pulled out the rod,
just like you said.

1134
01:23:06,994 --> 01:23:12,597
<i>That rod just temporarily binds
my chakra to the Jinchuriki's body.</i>

1135
01:23:13,017 --> 01:23:17,182
<i>But my chakra itself is held by that
masked guy through the Gedo Statue.</i>

1136
01:23:17,837 --> 01:23:19,339
You knew about that?!

1137
01:23:19,768 --> 01:23:21,770
Then it means that
I haven't saved you!

1138
01:23:24,309 --> 01:23:26,692
<i>You... You're seriously saying
that for real...?</i>

1139
01:23:26,717 --> 01:23:27,844
Of course, I am!

1140
01:23:37,578 --> 01:23:40,414
<i>This kid... He really is serious...</i>

1141
01:23:41,443 --> 01:23:44,626
<i>I only told you how to stop me.</i>

1142
01:23:44,959 --> 01:23:47,086
<i>I never told you how to save me.</i>

1143
01:23:47,376 --> 01:23:49,670
You should have told me
that from the beginning!

1144
01:23:50,424 --> 01:23:53,844
Why aren't Tailed Beasts
more straightforward?!

1145
01:23:55,472 --> 01:23:56,718
So what do I have to do?!

1146
01:23:58,279 --> 01:24:01,282
<i>Before I tell you,
I have something to pass on to you.</i>

1147
01:24:01,693 --> 01:24:02,694
What is it?

1148
01:24:03,145 --> 01:24:04,271
<i>Hold out your hand...</i>

1149
01:24:04,814 --> 01:24:07,233
Huh? You're giving me something?

1150
01:24:07,930 --> 01:24:08,931
<i>It's something good.</i>

1151
01:24:09,401 --> 01:24:12,738
<i>It will come in handy
one of these days. Hurry up!</i>

1152
01:24:30,363 --> 01:24:31,134
What?!

1153
01:24:39,608 --> 01:24:43,779
The statue reabsorbed Four-Tails!
I guess he's still under his control!

1154
01:25:00,650 --> 01:25:01,984
You look like you're
about to pass out

1155
01:25:02,009 --> 01:25:03,427
after stopping
just one Tailed Beast...

1156
01:25:03,530 --> 01:25:05,323
You can't defy me!

1157
01:25:06,333 --> 01:25:10,131
I'm going to take your precious
Tailed Beast with these...

1158
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:13,418
What's going on?!

1159
01:25:24,810 --> 01:25:26,812
<i>This is bad,
no matter how you look at it.</i>

1160
01:25:26,812 --> 01:25:29,147
<i>And you're a mess.</i>

1161
01:25:29,356 --> 01:25:32,901
Idiot. Just watch me...

1162
01:25:33,902 --> 01:25:38,949
<i>If you want me to lend you power,
I wouldn't mind doing it, Naruto.</i>

1163
01:25:41,827 --> 01:25:45,330
You sure are talking to me a lot, lately.

1164
01:25:46,670 --> 01:25:48,922
I'm glad you want to lend me power,

1165
01:25:50,002 --> 01:25:52,838
but before you do,
there's something I have to say.

1166
01:25:56,588 --> 01:25:58,799
Thanks for helping me with
the other Madara back there.

1167
01:26:00,262 --> 01:26:04,558
That extra power really saved me!

1168
01:26:04,808 --> 01:26:06,977
<i>Don't thank me!
It's creeping me out!</i>

1169
01:26:07,644 --> 01:26:11,565
<i>I just did that because I'd rather
deal with you than Madara!</i>

1170
01:26:12,645 --> 01:26:16,966
<i>Besides, I could only give you a
tiny bit of chakra because of this cage!</i>

1171
01:26:17,717 --> 01:26:21,638
<i>I just wanted to see you fight
a little more!</i>

1172
01:26:22,548 --> 01:26:23,549
<i>That's right...</i>

1173
01:26:24,202 --> 01:26:25,746
<i>Just to pass the time!</i>

1174
01:26:25,771 --> 01:26:28,907
Hey! Why do have to get mad
when I just thanked you?

1175
01:26:29,207 --> 01:26:31,001
You don't have to
stop glaring at me,

1176
01:26:31,043 --> 01:26:33,003
but you could at least work
on your attitude!

1177
01:26:33,003 --> 01:26:34,004
You're always like—?!

1178
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:39,676
<i>Meld your chakra with mine...</i>

1179
01:26:40,177 --> 01:26:43,472
Are we going to play chakra
tug-of-war again?

1180
01:26:43,555 --> 01:26:44,556
<i>You idiot...</i>

1181
01:26:44,723 --> 01:26:47,100
<i>We don't need to do that this time!</i>

1182
01:26:47,392 --> 01:26:49,728
<i>It's not like I have
anything else to do.</i>

1183
01:26:49,891 --> 01:26:52,117
<i>So we could if
you really wanted to.</i>

1184
01:27:14,086 --> 01:27:15,712
Let's do this, Octopops!

1185
01:27:16,380 --> 01:27:18,632
We fight as a two-man team
with me taking the lead.

1186
01:27:18,673 --> 01:27:22,803
Naruto, you just be
my backup, agreed?

1187
01:27:23,139 --> 01:27:25,391
<i>Even so, we're going up
against five Tailed Beasts.</i>

1188
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:28,392
<i>You can't be on the front lines if you can't
do a Tailed Beast Transformation!</i>

1189
01:27:28,481 --> 01:27:31,703
Both you and Eight-o are hurt,

1190
01:27:31,805 --> 01:27:33,615
so there isn't going to be
any leading or backing up!

1191
01:27:34,092 --> 01:27:35,093
We're going in together!

1192
01:27:35,623 --> 01:27:37,042
Hey... Naruto!

1193
01:27:37,567 --> 01:27:39,986
Especially since we're both already
in two-man teams...

1194
01:27:40,112 --> 01:27:43,532
<i>Hold on, Naruto... Don't tell me...
You and the Nine-Tails...</i>

1195
01:27:44,241 --> 01:27:47,411
I've still got tons
of reserve power!

1196
01:27:58,380 --> 01:27:59,923
I guess it was true all along!

1197
01:28:00,882 --> 01:28:03,760
Yeah... if he were the Demon Fox.

1198
01:28:04,953 --> 01:28:07,122
But Naruto is different!

1199
01:28:08,390 --> 01:28:12,310
He's... He's an excellent student...

1200
01:28:13,016 --> 01:28:14,501
that I have acknowledged!

1201
01:28:17,754 --> 01:28:20,256
He works very hard...

1202
01:28:21,486 --> 01:28:25,907
Despite that, he's clumsy and
no one would accept him...

1203
01:28:29,119 --> 01:28:32,247
So he already understands the pain
in people's hearts.

1204
01:28:33,457 --> 01:28:35,709
He is no longer the Demon Fox.

1205
01:28:36,688 --> 01:28:39,713
He's a member of the Hidden Leaf Village...

1206
01:28:41,803 --> 01:28:43,430
He's Naruto Uzumaki!

1207
01:28:50,045 --> 01:28:52,881
You're no longer the Demon Fox...

1208
01:28:54,027 --> 01:28:57,364
You are a member of the Hidden Leaf
and my partner...

1209
01:29:03,514 --> 01:29:04,515
Kurama!

1210
01:29:07,017 --> 01:29:08,132
Come on, let's do this!

1211
01:29:16,208 --> 01:29:18,376
Naruto... Don't tell me you...

1212
01:29:23,632 --> 01:29:25,422
Th-This is really bad!

1213
01:29:25,447 --> 01:29:27,032
Guy, don't move!

1214
01:29:28,353 --> 01:29:30,105
I'm going to blow them away
with my left eye's Kamui!

1215
01:29:30,222 --> 01:29:31,431
There's so many of them!

1216
01:29:31,431 --> 01:29:33,058
It's impossible with
Visual Prowess alone!

1217
01:29:33,547 --> 01:29:35,799
In that case,
I'll open the Eighth Gate...

1218
01:29:35,936 --> 01:29:39,064
You idiot!
You'll die after you do that!

1219
01:29:39,272 --> 01:29:40,273
But still...

1220
01:29:40,315 --> 01:29:42,526
<i>Naruto! Looks like they're
in trouble over there!</i>

1221
01:29:42,741 --> 01:29:45,369
<i>There are five Tailed Beast Bombs
aimed right at them!</i>

1222
01:29:45,779 --> 01:29:48,198
I know about it... y'know!

1223
01:29:51,243 --> 01:29:52,244
What was that?! So fast!

1224
01:29:58,458 --> 01:30:00,627
S-Sensei?!

1225
01:30:07,161 --> 01:30:09,121
I-Is that, Naruto?!

1226
01:30:21,314 --> 01:30:22,357
The mountain...

1227
01:30:22,482 --> 01:30:24,526
So this is the power of
the Tailed Beasts!

1228
01:30:25,735 --> 01:30:27,571
<i>He deflected them all?!</i>

1229
01:30:27,946 --> 01:30:28,947
<i>In that case...</i>

1230
01:30:32,826 --> 01:30:33,827
Here they come!

1231
01:30:33,868 --> 01:30:35,495
Let's go, Kurama!

1232
01:30:54,723 --> 01:30:58,268
Was Naruto able to do
Tailed Beast Transformation?

1233
01:30:58,727 --> 01:30:59,978
<i>That Nine-Tails...</i>

1234
01:31:01,229 --> 01:31:02,480
What's going on?!

1235
01:31:04,941 --> 01:31:06,443
Are we inside
the Nine-Tails' chakra?!

1236
01:31:08,987 --> 01:31:11,698
First, we have to figure out
where all of their rods are!

1237
01:31:13,283 --> 01:31:15,660
<i>Just to let you know,
we don't have much time here.</i>

1238
01:31:16,202 --> 01:31:18,913
<i>This is our first Tailed Beast
Transformation, so our link isn't perfect.</i>

1239
01:31:19,664 --> 01:31:22,208
<i>We can only keep this up
for about five minutes!</i>

1240
01:31:22,459 --> 01:31:23,585
That's more than enough time.

1241
01:31:26,499 --> 01:31:27,959
There are more of you,

1242
01:31:28,089 --> 01:31:29,799
so I can't be as gentle
as I was with Son.

1243
01:31:29,968 --> 01:31:31,422
So just grit your teeth!

1244
01:32:01,706 --> 01:32:04,668
<i>I'm not falling for that same trick twice!</i>

1245
01:32:10,173 --> 01:32:11,591
Take this!

1246
01:32:19,641 --> 01:32:22,477
All right! I found out where they all are!

1247
01:32:22,852 --> 01:32:26,106
This is like an all-out monster
smack down!

1248
01:32:27,065 --> 01:32:28,441
He exceeded my expectations.

1249
01:32:28,817 --> 01:32:31,528
I'll have to go after him
with intent to kill.

1250
01:32:49,379 --> 01:32:52,424
Hey... Don't you think that's pretty big
for one of those things?

1251
01:32:52,841 --> 01:32:55,635
Are they pooling their power
into a single point?!

1252
01:32:56,261 --> 01:32:58,096
Naruto, what now?!

1253
01:33:04,394 --> 01:33:06,521
<i>Is he going to cancel it out
with equal force?!</i>

1254
01:33:06,905 --> 01:33:09,269
<i>But Naruto's never succeeded
at that before...</i>

1255
01:33:09,294 --> 01:33:11,880
He managed to do it
by accident during training,

1256
01:33:12,107 --> 01:33:14,487
but this time, he'll do it for sure.

1257
01:33:14,696 --> 01:33:16,217
– <i>Tailed Beast Bomb!</i>
– <i>Tailed Beast Bomb!</i>

1258
01:33:40,930 --> 01:33:43,683
<i>He aimed it low, so it would
bounce them upwards.</i>

1259
01:33:44,267 --> 01:33:46,436
<i>That was good...
but it was really big!</i>

1260
01:33:46,644 --> 01:33:48,938
Nine-Tails sure is strong...

1261
01:33:57,530 --> 01:33:58,823
I've got all their rods!

1262
01:34:09,667 --> 01:34:10,877
Let's do this, Kurama!

1263
01:34:11,185 --> 01:34:12,770
We're going to pull them out
all at once!

1264
01:34:12,837 --> 01:34:18,259
We're going to free them all!
And definitely save everyone!

1265
01:34:26,387 --> 01:34:27,513
We've been waiting for you.

1266
01:34:27,769 --> 01:34:28,395
Huh?

1267
01:34:29,367 --> 01:34:31,244
The same thing happened with Son.

1268
01:34:31,615 --> 01:34:36,828
You did get all the way to this dimension...
just as Four-Tails said.

1269
01:34:37,723 --> 01:34:40,183
<i>This isn't where Four-Tails was...</i>

1270
01:34:41,491 --> 01:34:43,451
<i>Now that we're fully linked,</i>

1271
01:34:43,598 --> 01:34:48,623
<i>you're able to enter deeper into
the Tailed Beast Psyche Dimension.</i>

1272
01:34:49,249 --> 01:34:52,252
<i>Look! There are Jinchuriki here too!</i>

1273
01:34:52,877 --> 01:34:56,756
<i>Also, Four-Tails was bound
by chakra chains.</i>

1274
01:34:57,624 --> 01:35:00,260
I don't really get it,

1275
01:35:00,301 --> 01:35:03,096
but everyone's here and
there aren't any chains.

1276
01:35:03,253 --> 01:35:04,588
It's not as crazy as last time!

1277
01:35:05,223 --> 01:35:08,476
<i>That jerk in the mask cannot
penetrate this deep.</i>

1278
01:35:10,085 --> 01:35:11,384
Welcome!

1279
01:35:11,784 --> 01:35:14,440
I thank you on behalf of all of
us Jinchuriki and Tailed Beasts.

1280
01:35:15,149 --> 01:35:17,277
I've wanted to meet you,
Naruto Uzumaki!

1281
01:35:17,958 --> 01:35:19,279
To tell you the truth... huh?

1282
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:24,242
You look shorter, younger,
and weaker than me!

1283
01:35:24,471 --> 01:35:27,641
You must have had it rough
as a Jinchuriki.

1284
01:35:28,426 --> 01:35:31,513
Knowing how you went through that...

1285
01:35:31,852 --> 01:35:34,447
And how you've already passed on...

1286
01:35:34,790 --> 01:35:36,626
It's just so sad.

1287
01:35:37,226 --> 01:35:38,978
You never knew
the taste of good ramen...

1288
01:35:39,132 --> 01:35:42,051
or what it felt like to kiss a girl!

1289
01:35:42,277 --> 01:35:44,571
– <i>Hey! You've never kissed a girl either!</i>
– I'm the former Fourth Mizukage!

1290
01:35:44,596 --> 01:35:46,431
– <i>Hey! You've never kissed a girl either!</i>
– I was quite distinguished!

1291
01:35:46,431 --> 01:35:48,016
– <i>Actually...</i>
– And I'm an adult!

1292
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:51,202
<i>You've only kissed Sasuke.</i>

1293
01:35:51,227 --> 01:35:54,005
No! Don't make me remember that!

1294
01:35:55,565 --> 01:35:57,483
Hey, you're barfing way too much!

1295
01:35:57,511 --> 01:35:59,555
What was it like kissing that Sasuke?!

1296
01:35:59,919 --> 01:36:02,672
I'm talking to you!

1297
01:36:03,178 --> 01:36:06,595
Honestly, just as Four-Tails said,
you don't listen at all!

1298
01:36:07,911 --> 01:36:09,162
Four-Tails?

1299
01:36:10,604 --> 01:36:12,647
So, Son was here too?

1300
01:36:13,134 --> 01:36:14,260
That's right...

1301
01:36:14,876 --> 01:36:15,919
<i>Finally...</i>

1302
01:36:17,954 --> 01:36:20,581
So does that mean that
bearded old man was here too?

1303
01:36:20,606 --> 01:36:21,649
Yup!

1304
01:36:22,008 --> 01:36:23,509
<i>Make sure to tell him...</i>

1305
01:36:24,761 --> 01:36:28,848
<i>Also, I was able to give him
just a tiny bit of my chakra.</i>

1306
01:36:31,626 --> 01:36:36,839
<i>Do you remember what Old Man
Six Paths told us at the very end?</i>

1307
01:36:37,512 --> 01:36:39,472
<i>I think this kid's it...</i>

1308
01:36:40,485 --> 01:36:42,070
<i>That's what I felt.</i>

1309
01:36:42,656 --> 01:36:46,410
<i>I wager he'll probably come here
to save all of you too.</i>

1310
01:36:46,991 --> 01:36:49,202
<i>Look after that kid when he does.</i>

1311
01:36:49,596 --> 01:36:51,807
<i>I'm being pulled back
into the statue...</i>

1312
01:36:52,288 --> 01:36:53,998
<i>Goodbye for now, guys.</i>

1313
01:36:55,455 --> 01:36:58,583
Four-Tails...
This is just hypothetical, but...

1314
01:37:00,954 --> 01:37:05,084
Do you think we could have
traveled down a different path too?

1315
01:37:07,110 --> 01:37:10,028
<i>This coming from you, who's even
more stubborn than Tsuchikage Ohnoki?</i>

1316
01:37:10,053 --> 01:37:12,180
<i>Have you gone soft after death?</i>

1317
01:37:13,768 --> 01:37:17,772
<i>Well... maybe if you had tried
to remember my name,</i>

1318
01:37:17,814 --> 01:37:20,900
<i>right when you became
my Jinchuriki...</i>

1319
01:37:22,794 --> 01:37:26,631
I haven't softened enough to
start calling you by your name,

1320
01:37:26,922 --> 01:37:30,676
after being your Jinchuriki
for over forty years...

1321
01:37:31,062 --> 01:37:33,648
But I haven't forgotten it either!

1322
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:37,709
<i>In that case, say my full name,
spiel and all.</i>

1323
01:37:40,921 --> 01:37:42,339
Is just "Son" good enough?

1324
01:37:52,796 --> 01:37:55,643
We assembled here on
Four-Tails' summons...

1325
01:37:55,718 --> 01:37:59,388
and hung around after promising
to tell, and give you, something.

1326
01:37:59,939 --> 01:38:02,525
I see... He did all that?

1327
01:38:05,219 --> 01:38:08,680
I'm glad that you're all gathered
together and getting along!

1328
01:38:09,165 --> 01:38:13,669
That only happened after
Four-Tails and Roshi left here.

1329
01:38:13,714 --> 01:38:16,968
It's all thanks to you, Naruto.

1330
01:38:17,999 --> 01:38:20,877
<i>Naruto, step forward and
extend your hand...</i>

1331
01:38:21,057 --> 01:38:25,728
<i>We shall now fulfill our promise
to Four-Tails... rather Son Goku.</i>

1332
01:38:28,576 --> 01:38:30,619
<i>My name is Matatabi.</i>

1333
01:38:31,012 --> 01:38:32,138
Yugito Ni'i...

1334
01:38:33,598 --> 01:38:34,974
<i>My name is Isobu.</i>

1335
01:38:35,670 --> 01:38:37,163
We've met before, huh?

1336
01:38:37,930 --> 01:38:40,658
I'm Yagura,
the former Fourth Mizukage.

1337
01:38:41,970 --> 01:38:43,822
<i>I am Kokuo.</i>

1338
01:38:44,089 --> 01:38:44,750
I'm Han.

1339
01:38:45,989 --> 01:38:48,077
<i>Me, I am called Saiken.</i>

1340
01:38:48,747 --> 01:38:50,812
You already know me, I'm Utakata.

1341
01:38:51,571 --> 01:38:53,739
<i>I'm Lucky Seven Chomei.</i>

1342
01:38:54,002 --> 01:38:54,995
I'm Fuu!

1343
01:39:15,466 --> 01:39:17,843
I will not live much longer...

1344
01:39:18,282 --> 01:39:23,246
Shukaku, Matatabi, Isobu,
Son Goku, Kokuo,

1345
01:39:23,432 --> 01:39:27,353
Saiken, Chomei, Gyuki, and Kurama...

1346
01:39:27,531 --> 01:39:30,451
Even if you are far apart,
you will always be together.

1347
01:39:31,190 --> 01:39:33,526
There will come a time when
you will be united again.

1348
01:39:33,818 --> 01:39:37,863
Each of you with a unique name...
and a different form than before.

1349
01:39:38,781 --> 01:39:41,701
And unlike when you were inside me,

1350
01:39:41,726 --> 01:39:43,603
you will be guided down
the right path.

1351
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:46,288
I hope you learn what true strength is...

1352
01:39:47,832 --> 01:39:49,709
Before that time...

1353
01:40:04,303 --> 01:40:06,973
<i>It's taken way too long, Old Man.</i>

1354
01:40:12,533 --> 01:40:16,329
<i>Don't you all agree?
That Naruto's the Old Man's...</i>

1355
01:40:17,445 --> 01:40:18,571
<i>Yes!</i>

1356
01:40:20,072 --> 01:40:21,115
<i>Yup!</i>

1357
01:40:22,450 --> 01:40:23,451
<i>Yeah!</i>

1358
01:40:24,702 --> 01:40:25,786
<i>Indeed...</i>

1359
01:40:27,204 --> 01:40:28,210
<i>For sure...</i>

1360
01:40:42,052 --> 01:40:43,971
<i>Well done, Naruto!</i>

1361
01:40:44,936 --> 01:40:47,850
I never thought you'd be able to
completely control Nine-Tails.

1362
01:40:48,559 --> 01:40:51,812
However, it looks like you still
can't maintain it for too long.

1363
01:40:52,438 --> 01:40:54,607
So same old, same old.

1364
01:41:11,306 --> 01:41:12,975
It's not the same old, same old...

1365
01:41:14,701 --> 01:41:18,913
I just learned a bunch
of hard names all at once!

1366
01:41:20,174 --> 01:41:22,134
Difficult names?

1367
01:41:22,878 --> 01:41:24,463
What does that have to do
with anything?

1368
01:41:25,971 --> 01:41:27,932
You don't know, do you?!

1369
01:41:34,647 --> 01:41:36,524
I'm not going to tell you!

1370
01:41:41,821 --> 01:41:45,741
Naruto gaining
such experience and strength

1371
01:41:46,158 --> 01:41:48,577
makes me feel old and feeble.

1372
01:41:48,994 --> 01:41:50,287
What's the matter?

1373
01:41:50,496 --> 01:41:52,373
You're not being yourself!

1374
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:55,209
It may sound funny
coming from me...

1375
01:41:55,267 --> 01:41:59,855
The springtime of our youth
is still far from over!

1376
01:42:00,395 --> 01:42:01,771
We still have a lot of...

1377
01:42:01,924 --> 01:42:04,468
Quiet! Do you want to make me
feel even worse?

1378
01:42:05,052 --> 01:42:06,720
That's the Guy I know!

1379
01:42:10,975 --> 01:42:12,101
<i>That expression...</i>

1380
01:42:17,731 --> 01:42:19,608
<i>Huh? Am I sweating?</i>

1381
01:42:21,986 --> 01:42:23,696
<i>No, it's just rain.</i>

1382
01:42:25,698 --> 01:42:29,910
<i>These fools could never
make me sweat.</i>

1383
01:42:32,715 --> 01:42:35,574
<i>Naruto was always
merely a pawn to test Sasuke.</i>

1384
01:42:36,375 --> 01:42:39,358
<i>That brat's supposed to be
an amusement.</i>

1385
01:42:41,005 --> 01:42:43,257
<i>I knew what his limits were.</i>

1386
01:42:44,241 --> 01:42:46,577
<i>There's no way his power could be
pushing me this hard.</i>

1387
01:42:47,803 --> 01:42:49,513
<i>So what is it?!</i>

1388
01:42:50,330 --> 01:42:51,707
<i>What happened?</i>

1389
01:42:55,930 --> 01:42:58,808
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

1390
01:42:59,899 --> 01:43:02,526
<i>It doesn't matter who
or what Naruto is now...</i>

1391
01:43:05,429 --> 01:43:07,472
<i>After this war is over,</i>

1392
01:43:07,544 --> 01:43:10,923
<i>there will be no past or future.</i>

1393
01:43:11,460 --> 01:43:13,378
<i>Nothing that exists now
will matter then!</i>

1394
01:43:19,059 --> 01:43:20,436
A-Amazing...

1395
01:43:22,004 --> 01:43:23,964
Did you guys feel that?

1396
01:43:24,423 --> 01:43:26,133
I can't believe it.

1397
01:43:26,592 --> 01:43:30,429
There's no doubt.
That is the Nine-Tails' power!

1398
01:43:30,596 --> 01:43:31,597
Yeah...

1399
01:43:32,305 --> 01:43:35,684
<i>But I sense something...
slightly different.</i>

1400
01:43:37,061 --> 01:43:38,520
What's the current situation?

1401
01:43:39,188 --> 01:43:41,523
Naruto Uzumaki is holding back
the Masked Madara

1402
01:43:41,565 --> 01:43:43,567
with an unbelievable amount
of power.

1403
01:43:43,981 --> 01:43:45,357
The chakra is unbelievable!

1404
01:43:46,070 --> 01:43:47,780
He's keeping him at bay.

1405
01:43:48,104 --> 01:43:52,108
It's just the four of them!
Naruto, Bee, Kakashi and Guy!

1406
01:43:54,662 --> 01:43:55,514
Inoichi!

1407
01:43:55,829 --> 01:43:58,665
Relay Naruto's actions directly
into the minds

1408
01:43:58,749 --> 01:44:02,419
of the reinforcement troops
with everything you've got!

1409
01:44:02,836 --> 01:44:04,088
Fifteen seconds is all we need!

1410
01:44:04,463 --> 01:44:06,590
I want to boost everyone's morale
all at once!

1411
01:44:07,432 --> 01:44:09,642
Those four are giving it their all!

1412
01:44:10,259 --> 01:44:13,178
I want the rest of us here
to do everything we can too.

1413
01:44:13,764 --> 01:44:15,724
Transmit their resolve to everyone!

1414
01:44:16,074 --> 01:44:17,242
To everyone?!

1415
01:44:17,518 --> 01:44:21,522
It will overload the chakra network.

1416
01:44:21,922 --> 01:44:22,965
Make one mistake and...

1417
01:44:24,430 --> 01:44:25,431
You ask for the extreme.

1418
01:44:26,463 --> 01:44:27,380
Make it ten seconds!

1419
01:44:27,660 --> 01:44:28,476
Master Inoichi!

1420
01:44:29,246 --> 01:44:32,049
Sorry, but this is critical!

1421
01:44:32,293 --> 01:44:34,546
Make it short,
but make it count!

1422
01:44:35,369 --> 01:44:37,913
I'm not good with words,
but you can count on me!

1423
01:44:40,165 --> 01:44:41,458
<i>Message from HQ!</i>

1424
01:44:42,042 --> 01:44:44,461
<i>We have the upper hand at
the battle reinforcement point!</i>

1425
01:44:45,254 --> 01:44:48,298
<i>Naruto Uzumaki is standing firm!</i>

1426
01:44:48,757 --> 01:44:52,427
<i>The ones we must protect at all costs,
Naruto and Bee...</i>

1427
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:55,931
<i>are fighting with everything
they've got on the front line!</i>

1428
01:44:56,572 --> 01:44:58,324
<i>Guy and Kakashi are there too!</i>

1429
01:44:58,890 --> 01:45:00,767
<i>And I want everyone in the Alliance...</i>

1430
01:45:00,792 --> 01:45:02,919
<i>to join your strong feelings with theirs!</i>

1431
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:06,025
<i>Because those strong feelings...</i>

1432
01:45:08,277 --> 01:45:11,613
<i>are the prophecy... 
that leads to our victory!</i>

1433
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:22,474
I'm bad with words, after all.

1434
01:45:23,373 --> 01:45:26,125
It took me 20 seconds.

1435
01:45:27,546 --> 01:45:28,360
Captain...

1436
01:45:29,662 --> 01:45:30,488
<i>Yeah...</i>

1437
01:45:31,008 --> 01:45:34,094
<i>That just shows how mighty
your heart is...</i>

1438
01:45:42,978 --> 01:45:43,979
<i>Naruto...</i>

1439
01:45:44,593 --> 01:45:49,475
<i>I have always... always...
always been chasing after you.</i>

1440
01:45:50,229 --> 01:45:52,732
<i>And I'm still running after you.</i>

1441
01:45:56,777 --> 01:45:59,780
<i>But when this war is over.</i>

1442
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:02,628
<i>I'm going to stop running.</i>

1443
01:46:04,552 --> 01:46:09,390
<i>I'll stand with you.
I'll hold your hand.</i>

1444
01:46:10,089 --> 01:46:11,882
<i>And I'll walk with you by your side.</i>

1445
01:46:14,707 --> 01:46:15,749
<i>So please wait for me!</i>

1446
01:46:19,487 --> 01:46:20,780
<i>Naruto...</i>

1447
01:46:20,974 --> 01:46:26,980
<i>I marked you as
my rival ages ago.</i>

1448
01:46:28,565 --> 01:46:32,069
<i>hold out against Madara,
until I get there!</i>

1449
01:46:33,631 --> 01:46:36,926
<i>I'll support you completely
with my ninjutsu, Naruto.</i>

1450
01:46:37,672 --> 01:46:40,174
<i>As for the reason...
It is not necessary!</i>

1451
01:46:41,626 --> 01:46:43,878
Naruto is doing a good job.

1452
01:46:44,484 --> 01:46:47,862
I can't see him being
anything other than reckless.

1453
01:46:48,210 --> 01:46:51,547
But despite his looks,
he's a pretty sharp guy.

1454
01:46:52,256 --> 01:46:56,135
People thought Naruto was dumb
and I was fat.

1455
01:46:56,510 --> 01:46:59,179
But that really wasn't the case!

1456
01:47:00,737 --> 01:47:03,114
<i>Wait for me, smart Naruto!</i>

1457
01:47:03,244 --> 01:47:05,455
<i>A Slim Choji is coming to help you!</i>

1458
01:47:05,947 --> 01:47:08,991
He's not the type to strategize calmly.

1459
01:47:10,107 --> 01:47:12,109
<i>That's what I'm here for.</i>

1460
01:47:12,151 --> 01:47:14,611
<i>So you just wait, Naruto.
I'll be right there!</i>

1461
01:47:18,611 --> 01:47:20,321
<i>Thank you, Dad!</i>

1462
01:47:21,285 --> 01:47:25,497
<i>You transmitted Naruto's mighty heart
to everyone.</i>

1463
01:47:26,384 --> 01:47:29,345
<i>That promise must be fulfilled!</i>

1464
01:47:30,674 --> 01:47:32,593
<i>I wonder if Guy-sensei is all right?!</i>

1465
01:47:33,079 --> 01:47:35,457
<i>I hope he's protecting Naruto!</i>

1466
01:47:35,982 --> 01:47:37,859
<i>Kakashi-sensei is there too.</i>

1467
01:47:38,051 --> 01:47:39,845
<i>I think they'll manage, but...</i>

1468
01:47:42,786 --> 01:47:44,120
If it wasn't raining,

1469
01:47:44,332 --> 01:47:46,501
we could have flown on
my Super Beast Scrolls.

1470
01:47:46,810 --> 01:47:48,854
Stop complaining, Sai.
Pick up your speed!

1471
01:47:50,022 --> 01:47:53,317
We must follow Guy-sensei
and Naruto's examples.

1472
01:47:53,342 --> 01:47:55,386
This is the time for us
to exceed ourselves!

1473
01:47:56,297 --> 01:47:57,298
Uh-huh...

1474
01:47:58,030 --> 01:48:00,115
<i>This is camaraderie...</i>

1475
01:48:00,629 --> 01:48:04,591
<i>I think I finally understand
human bonds, Naruto.</i>

1476
01:48:10,267 --> 01:48:11,268
<i>Naruto...</i>

1477
01:48:12,149 --> 01:48:13,859
<i>You saved the Hidden Leaf.</i>

1478
01:48:14,534 --> 01:48:17,746
<i>And now, you are trying to
save the shinobi world.</i>

1479
01:48:19,801 --> 01:48:24,348
<i>And we've always, always put
the burden on your shoulders.</i>

1480
01:48:25,226 --> 01:48:27,896
<i>But this time,
no matter what you say...</i>

1481
01:48:27,921 --> 01:48:29,006
<i>you'll have help.</i>

1482
01:48:31,939 --> 01:48:33,565
<i>Not just me.</i>

1483
01:48:34,576 --> 01:48:37,663
<i>This time,
we'll all fight together!</i>
