1
00:00:13,659 --> 00:00:17,205
This is the form,
the body I needed!

2
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:26,443
It's not a battle without raging blood...
and a pounding heart!

3
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,836
Ancient relics...

4
00:00:45,923 --> 00:00:47,383
should just stay out of this!

5
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:54,971
A brat who doesn't even
come close to my level.

6
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:59,184
You stole my line.

7
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:03,528
<i>Why did he close his eyes?</i>

8
00:01:04,344 --> 00:01:05,387
Sasuke!

9
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:09,235
It's pointless to just
throw attacks at him.

10
00:01:10,115 --> 00:01:13,035
This guy can absorb ninjutsu!

11
00:01:19,216 --> 00:01:22,052
When these two polar opposites
work together,

12
00:01:22,173 --> 00:01:24,550
it gives rise to all things
in this universe...

13
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:29,964
Hashirama, do you remember me
telling you this long ago

14
00:01:30,401 --> 00:01:33,093
in front of the Uchiha Stone Tablet?

15
00:01:35,367 --> 00:01:38,724
That the inscription
on the stone says,

16
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:43,436
when two opposite sides cooperate,
you have true happiness.

17
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:48,785
But I also told you it could
be interpreted differently.

18
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,154
That's...

19
00:01:54,397 --> 00:01:59,220
The one who obtains
both Uchiha and Senju powers

20
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:01,815
can attain true happiness.

21
00:02:02,813 --> 00:02:05,816
Don't you think it could be read
that way as well?

22
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,499
Hashirama?

23
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:12,533
It seems you've been doing
a lot of plotting

24
00:02:12,558 --> 00:02:15,213
since you left the village.

25
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,054
No... Actually, this is something

26
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:21,766
a comrade of my subordinate came up
with by coincidence.

27
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:26,729
Seems there was a fellow
who thought a lot like me.

28
00:02:30,385 --> 00:02:31,553
However...

29
00:02:31,578 --> 00:02:36,372
Me coming back to life
was exactly as planned!

30
00:02:41,136 --> 00:02:43,097
<i>Damn it... I can't move!</i>

31
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,603
Though things did happen
out of order.

32
00:02:58,628 --> 00:02:59,555
Oh well.

33
00:03:05,846 --> 00:03:08,682
So this is Sage Art chakra...

34
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:14,027
Is that all there is to it?

35
00:03:14,502 --> 00:03:17,047
Seems like this will
be easy to control.

36
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,755
This is the perfect chance now
that you are flesh and blood.

37
00:03:34,487 --> 00:03:36,865
This time I'll kill you for good,

38
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,636
and send you back
to the afterlife!

39
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:45,225
Curse your fate for being
a reanimation...

40
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,896
as you go to your death!

41
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,085
I can feel it...

42
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:02,408
Your Mangekyo are Choku Tomoe,
a straight pattern.

43
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:06,246
No wonder you have fine moves.

44
00:04:06,764 --> 00:04:09,940
It might be a good idea
to take your eyes

45
00:04:10,366 --> 00:04:13,997
until I get my Rinnegan back.

46
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:18,800
But killing you would be such
a waste with an eye like that.

47
00:04:20,196 --> 00:04:21,283
How about it?

48
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,616
You're a survivor of
the Uchiha like me.

49
00:04:25,108 --> 00:04:27,110
Want to join forces?

50
00:04:27,762 --> 00:04:32,142
Make no mistake.
You're a dead man.

51
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,191
Fine then...

52
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:39,612
In any case,
you don't have much time left.

53
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,781
<i>Fire Style:</i>

54
00:04:41,806 --> 00:04:43,808
<i>Hiding in Ash Jutsu!</i>

55
00:04:52,277 --> 00:04:55,071
<i>Madara is regaining his past strength.</i>

56
00:04:56,376 --> 00:04:59,224
<i>Not good. His next target is...</i>

57
00:05:17,148 --> 00:05:22,111
I'll be taking you all next...

58
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,991
you filthy beasts!

59
00:07:04,116 --> 00:07:09,208
<i>Obito... Your usefulness is over.</i>

60
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,225
What did you do?

61
00:07:15,883 --> 00:07:17,092
Madara...

62
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,399
has come back to life!

63
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:28,573
<i>You performed the Rinne Rebirth,
so you will die.</i>

64
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:31,492
<i>This is the last step.</i>

65
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,502
<i>I'm taking back that left eye.</i>

66
00:07:38,275 --> 00:07:45,699
<i>He'll last a little while longer
while I'm attached to him.</i>

67
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,508
Just what are you?

68
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,343
You're not human.

69
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:54,098
<i>I am Madara's will incarnate.</i>

70
00:07:54,605 --> 00:07:58,386
<i>I will eliminate anyone
who gets in Madara's way.</i>

71
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,101
Black Zetsu.

72
00:08:01,151 --> 00:08:03,153
I thought you'd been captured...

73
00:08:03,725 --> 00:08:10,941
<i>All of you, including Obito, greatly
underestimated Madara's plan.</i>

74
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:15,745
<i>You underestimated me as well.</i>

75
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:22,126
<i>I-I can't move now...</i>

76
00:08:22,643 --> 00:08:25,581
<i>I can't believe he's able
to transform his blade so much</i>

77
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:27,400
<i>in such an instant!</i>

78
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,571
<i>Then that's perfect.</i>

79
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,345
<i>You'll go to Obito and</i>

80
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,764
<i>bide your time until
I give you the order.</i>

81
00:08:35,993 --> 00:08:38,849
<i>I'm going to play a little here,
then head over.</i>

82
00:08:39,683 --> 00:08:42,930
<i>I just want to gauge
the present Kage's strength.</i>

83
00:08:44,093 --> 00:08:45,595
<i>I got it.</i>

84
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:10,383
<i>He's a useless traitor
who went against Madara's plan.</i>

85
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:17,390
<i>Until Obito dies,
I'll use his body to fight you.</i>

86
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,409
<i>I've got to get some use
out of him,</i>

87
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,353
<i>at least at the end.</i>

88
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,424
You know, staying here...

89
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,954
Yeah... isn't wise.

90
00:09:34,552 --> 00:09:35,840
Get away from here!

91
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,649
Shukaku! Get ready!

92
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,897
<i>Let's go wild!</i>

93
00:10:12,787 --> 00:10:14,122
<i>Wind Style:</i>

94
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,022
<i>Sand Bomb! Salvo!</i>

95
00:10:23,662 --> 00:10:24,786
Nice jutsu.

96
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,461
But it lacks in finishing power...

97
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:48,606
So you implant your sand with
this jutsu to stifle movement...

98
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:11,263
Now, Shukaku!

99
00:11:30,747 --> 00:11:33,125
<i>Grand Sand Mausoleum Seal!</i>

100
00:11:34,931 --> 00:11:37,984
<i>He'll never take another
breath of fresh air again!</i>

101
00:12:13,897 --> 00:12:16,483
I'll be putting collars
on all of you shortly.

102
00:12:16,685 --> 00:12:18,787
Not one of you will
be able to get away.

103
00:12:19,664 --> 00:12:21,408
I won't let you!

104
00:12:23,103 --> 00:12:25,767
<i>No one here's going to wag
his tail for you!</i>

105
00:12:26,383 --> 00:12:28,009
<i>Sorry we're late!</i>

106
00:12:28,231 --> 00:12:30,307
<i>We were moving the injured.</i>

107
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,534
<i>Don't worry!</i>

108
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:33,811
<i>There won't be any more wounded.</i>

109
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,755
<i>We're ending this now!</i>

110
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,365
<i>Stack tails!</i>

111
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:45,695
<i>You were close,
you damned raccoon!</i>

112
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:51,061
<i>Quit ordering us around,
you dumb fox!</i>

113
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:52,980
<i>But this should...</i>

114
00:13:05,025 --> 00:13:06,860
<i>Persistent bastard!</i>

115
00:13:06,985 --> 00:13:09,154
<i>But he's already taken a beating.</i>

116
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,248
All right! One more blast!

117
00:13:11,521 --> 00:13:13,246
Yeah, let's go, Naruto!

118
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,554
Sorry I'm late, Lord Madara.

119
00:13:25,864 --> 00:13:27,104
You're finally here.

120
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,933
Do you have it?

121
00:13:29,361 --> 00:13:31,029
Of course.

122
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,267
This should make things
a little more fun...

123
00:14:02,685 --> 00:14:07,719
<i>Finally... I can fully
savor battle again!</i>

124
00:14:20,636 --> 00:14:21,970
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

125
00:14:37,327 --> 00:14:39,412
He's going to fight us using that?

126
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:41,872
Kakashi, can you manage?

127
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,674
Yes, in one way or another...

128
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:45,343
<i>Kamui!</i>

129
00:14:51,979 --> 00:14:52,980
Did it work?

130
00:14:55,163 --> 00:14:56,164
I think...

131
00:14:57,503 --> 00:14:58,963
it failed...

132
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:04,945
Not that thing again!

133
00:15:06,483 --> 00:15:08,527
Seems the right arm's been wrenched off.

134
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:13,426
Seems there's someone left with
good eyes on the other side.

135
00:15:14,563 --> 00:15:16,398
Well, it's not much of an impediment.

136
00:15:17,006 --> 00:15:19,202
And now, I've got a pen for them.

137
00:15:21,426 --> 00:15:23,678
All I need to do is
shove them in there.

138
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:30,763
<i>A fake Rinnegan from a reanimation
can summon that thing?</i>

139
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,892
<i>He's bleeding and wounded.</i>

140
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:37,630
<i>In other words, he's not
a reanimation anymore.</i>

141
00:15:38,254 --> 00:15:41,257
<i>He possesses a real Rinnegan.</i>

142
00:15:42,436 --> 00:15:44,480
<i>How did he come back to life?!</i>

143
00:15:49,747 --> 00:15:53,626
<i>Naruto, I'm grateful to you.</i>

144
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:58,666
<i>You even extracted
the Tailed Beasts from Obito,</i>

145
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:02,336
<i>saving me the trouble
of weakening him.</i>

146
00:16:03,391 --> 00:16:04,809
Then Obito's...!

147
00:16:14,315 --> 00:16:18,240
<i>You're stubborn,
for someone near death.</i>

148
00:16:19,444 --> 00:16:24,625
<i>This left eye came to you
through Nagato,</i>

149
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:29,046
<i>but it's time for it to return
to its rightful owner.</i>

150
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:33,069
<i>The only ones who have awakened
the Rinnegan in this world</i>

151
00:16:33,094 --> 00:16:36,764
<i>are the Sage of Six Paths
and Madara Uchiha.</i>

152
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:43,091
<i>It's not a mere thing to
be hoarded by the likes of you.</i>

153
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,422
I've hidden the right eye...

154
00:16:46,536 --> 00:16:50,172
And I'm going to have Kakashi
destroy the left eye right now.

155
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:58,809
<i>White Zetsu found
the right eye a while ago</i>

156
00:16:59,092 --> 00:17:01,888
<i>and turned it over to Lord Madara.</i>

157
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:09,176
<i>You're a useless fool
who refuses to die...</i>

158
00:17:09,201 --> 00:17:11,495
<i>So stop resisting.</i>

159
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:17,364
<i>You'd be dead already
if I wasn't sticking to you.</i>

160
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:26,003
Then detach from me and
take the Rinnegan after I die.

161
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:32,801
<i>The instant I detach from you,
these two will kill me.</i>

162
00:17:33,151 --> 00:17:35,505
<i>Before I can take the Rinnegan.</i>

163
00:17:37,274 --> 00:17:42,679
<i>Have you forgotten that I was the
one who gathered intel for Akatsuki?</i>

164
00:17:43,243 --> 00:17:46,955
<i>I've already analyzed these two
and their strength.</i>

165
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:50,067
It's going to take a bit longer
for the left eye.

166
00:17:50,788 --> 00:17:52,581
Seems like it.

167
00:17:52,732 --> 00:17:55,773
This also looks like it's going
to take a bit longer too.

168
00:17:56,536 --> 00:18:00,731
Don't compare me to that brat who
took years to get back those pets.

169
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,996
You're covered in blood.

170
00:18:04,522 --> 00:18:07,692
Knowing that I possess
Hashirama's healing powers

171
00:18:08,346 --> 00:18:11,516
might cause me to fight crudely.

172
00:18:12,472 --> 00:18:14,420
I'll proceed more carefully.

173
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:20,320
If I use the Rinnegan's true powers, we
should see a more sophisticated battle.

174
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:22,858
It will only be a few seconds.

175
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,770
So watch closely!

176
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,151
<i>Limbo...</i>

177
00:18:31,882 --> 00:18:32,841
<i>Hengoku!</i>

178
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,656
<i>He might try something...</i>

179
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:37,009
<i>So be careful...</i>

180
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,322
<i>What is this?
What just happened?!</i>

181
00:18:58,852 --> 00:18:59,969
Damn you...

182
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,684
That ought to have tamed you a bit.

183
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,020
Now I can put on your collars!

184
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:23,933
Eight-o!

185
00:19:24,965 --> 00:19:25,775
Kurama!

186
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:35,883
First, I'll rip the Eight and
Nine-Tails from their Jinchuriki!

187
00:19:40,408 --> 00:19:41,153
Eight-o!

188
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,254
<i>Damn it!</i>

189
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,475
<i>That's right...</i>

190
00:19:45,701 --> 00:19:47,703
<i>If I just undo
this Kurama Mode...!</i>

191
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:48,854
It's useless.

192
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,585
Once I catch them,
I won't let them go.

193
00:19:52,767 --> 00:19:53,750
It's not working!

194
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,777
<i>Kurama's not going
back inside me...!</i>

195
00:19:57,813 --> 00:19:59,273
<i>Damn it, I'm being pulled backwards!</i>

196
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:04,161
Lord Madara, you must take them
in order starting with the One-Tail.

197
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,954
I know that.

198
00:20:06,251 --> 00:20:09,337
Since you need to rip out
the last two Tailed Beasts,

199
00:20:09,362 --> 00:20:11,864
Eight and Nine-Tails,
from the Jinchuriki,

200
00:20:11,889 --> 00:20:13,391
why not pull in the others,

201
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:16,378
the One-Tail through Seven-Tails
for the time being?

202
00:20:17,185 --> 00:20:20,897
You bastard! I'm not letting you
take Kurama!

203
00:20:21,371 --> 00:20:24,228
You're right, it looks like this will
take longer than I expected.

204
00:20:24,993 --> 00:20:28,590
So let's start... with this one!

205
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,064
<i>Desert Hands!</i>

206
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,486
You can't have Shukaku!

207
00:20:45,026 --> 00:20:47,278
Gaara, don't lose!

208
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:55,899
<i>Until now, I've always
considered you unpleasant.</i>

209
00:20:57,292 --> 00:20:59,577
<i>But it was because
I was a Jinchuriki,</i>

210
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,426
<i>that I was able to meet Naruto...</i>

211
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:05,084
<i>So there's one thing
I'm grateful to you for now.</i>

212
00:21:08,623 --> 00:21:10,271
You Sand brat!

213
00:21:10,296 --> 00:21:13,507
Are you really that happy
to have your old pet back?

214
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:17,870
To think you'd interfere, even though
you're no longer a Jinchuriki!

215
00:21:25,788 --> 00:21:28,666
<i>My motto is absolute defense!</i>

216
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:31,951
<i>I've still got my pride as Shukaku!</i>

217
00:21:32,784 --> 00:21:33,868
I know...

218
00:21:36,216 --> 00:21:38,973
No... you know nothing at all.

219
00:21:50,321 --> 00:21:52,073
<i>Gaara... Don't overexert yourself!</i>

220
00:21:54,129 --> 00:21:56,632
I'm no longer a Jinchuriki...

221
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:58,650
So...

222
00:22:01,384 --> 00:22:04,068
I can finally talk to you
on equal terms!

223
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,838
<i>Gaara... You...</i>

224
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,552
<i>Damn it!</i>

225
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,809
<i>Hey, Kazekage brat!</i>

226
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,186
<i>Do me a favor!</i>

227
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,070
All right...

228
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,864
<i>You got that... Gaara?!</i>

229
00:22:56,646 --> 00:22:57,647
Naruto!

230
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:24,908
Shukaku!

231
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:41,086
<i>Sorry... Bee!</i>

232
00:23:41,896 --> 00:23:44,884
<i>I'm counting on you...
Kazekage brat!</i>

233
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:56,783
I don't believe it...

234
00:23:56,808 --> 00:23:58,477
They've all been sucked in!

235
00:24:02,973 --> 00:24:03,917
Well, I guess...

236
00:24:03,991 --> 00:24:06,547
that's about all I can expect
from my current strength.

237
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,564
It took more than a few seconds...

238
00:24:11,801 --> 00:24:14,596
But you were faster than Obito.

239
00:24:16,106 --> 00:24:18,400
You really do talk too much.

240
00:24:19,012 --> 00:24:21,848
You're all failed experiments of mine...

241
00:24:22,147 --> 00:24:24,275
Always finding fault with me.

242
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:27,299
Black Zetsu is nicknamed
"Wicked Tongue"

243
00:24:27,649 --> 00:24:31,287
and they call us White Zetsu,
"Wagging Tongues".

244
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:36,245
I hope the other battle
is going well.

245
00:24:36,695 --> 00:24:41,324
Don't worry!
After all, the base is good.

246
00:24:42,178 --> 00:24:43,387
<i>Flying Raijin Slice!</i>

247
00:24:51,542 --> 00:24:52,375
<i>You're mine!</i>

248
00:24:55,183 --> 00:24:56,297
<i>This is my chance!</i>

249
00:24:59,056 --> 00:25:01,537
<i>I swear I will not let you die!</i>

250
00:25:03,054 --> 00:25:04,306
<i>Like I'd let you die!</i>

251
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:18,094
It's your M. O. to strike an opponent
when he's convinced of victory...

252
00:25:19,207 --> 00:25:20,621
Making the brats do the work...

253
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:24,525
You still tend to leave things to
others, don't you, Tobirama?

254
00:25:25,893 --> 00:25:27,114
The same goes for you.

255
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,365
However, heaven is on my side.

256
00:25:33,943 --> 00:25:37,988
Look at you, the one touted
as the fastest shinobi ever.

257
00:25:39,054 --> 00:25:44,015
There's a reason why you two
brothers can't regain your former speed.

258
00:25:44,714 --> 00:25:48,943
Whether it's coincidence or if it's
inevitable... I've got the edge now.

259
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:54,386
Plus I'm nurturing a new eye.

260
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,597
Though it's unclear which side
they'll end up on...

261
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:09,442
<i>Wait!</i>

262
00:26:11,422 --> 00:26:12,735
<i>Uchiha lad...</i>

263
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,449
<i>Let me give you a jutsu.</i>

264
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,159
<i>A jutsu?</i>

265
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,036
<i>Yes...</i>

266
00:26:20,484 --> 00:26:23,973
<i>Madara stole my Sage chakra...</i>

267
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:28,878
<i>This jutsu will respond to
the Sage chakra and bind him.</i>

268
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:34,085
<i>I will give you all of
my remaining chakra.</i>

269
00:26:35,526 --> 00:26:37,027
<i>You must stop Madara...</i>

270
00:26:38,236 --> 00:26:39,874
<i>Why ask me, an Uchiha?</i>

271
00:26:42,528 --> 00:26:43,946
<i>You're a lot like him...</i>

272
00:26:45,202 --> 00:26:47,204
<i>Madara's younger brother...</i>

273
00:26:47,847 --> 00:26:49,516
<i>Izuna Uchiha.</i>

274
00:26:52,114 --> 00:26:56,202
<i>So? What does that have to do
with stopping him?</i>

275
00:26:57,476 --> 00:26:59,725
<i>Madara's fundamentally
a kind man.</i>

276
00:27:00,776 --> 00:27:04,544
<i>He was a man of deep love
who cherished his siblings.</i>

277
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,624
<i>That's why he gave you
a chance at redemption.</i>

278
00:27:08,649 --> 00:27:12,778
<i>You might be able to stop Madara
without using force.</i>

279
00:27:14,781 --> 00:27:17,075
<i>Now... come stand before me.</i>

280
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,150
To be honest...

281
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:36,336
I've wanted to do this
to you for a long time.

282
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,075
Since you're...

283
00:27:46,483 --> 00:27:48,943
the one who killed Izuna!

284
00:27:50,152 --> 00:27:53,697
But you're just a moving corpse,
so it's hardly fulfilling.

285
00:27:54,445 --> 00:27:56,841
Madara... What is it that you
desire so badly

286
00:27:56,866 --> 00:27:58,492
that you'd come back to life for?

287
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:02,597
Our era, our time ended...
ages ago!

288
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:07,560
I just want to build the nation
that Hashirama couldn't.

289
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:12,982
But this world belongs to Hashirama,
my predecessor who failed.

290
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:17,112
Drastic measures are needed
to save the dying patient.

291
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:20,031
I'm going on ahead!

292
00:28:21,627 --> 00:28:25,547
So this thing called
the Infinite Tsukuyomi was your idea?

293
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,248
This is your idea of a cure?

294
00:28:29,094 --> 00:28:33,223
Yes. Hashirama's nation-building
bore a paradox.

295
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,714
People desire peace...

296
00:28:36,453 --> 00:28:39,665
And yet, on the other hand,
crave conflict as well.

297
00:28:40,754 --> 00:28:43,576
That duality is mankind.

298
00:28:44,453 --> 00:28:48,028
To only want peace
and to discard conflict...

299
00:28:48,273 --> 00:28:51,193
would cause people
to stop being people.

300
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,983
And those two things stand
together side by side.

301
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:04,784
Be they a friend... sibling...
or even my own child...

302
00:29:05,352 --> 00:29:07,855
I will not forgive anyone
who threatens the village.

303
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:17,743
People will sacrifice something in order
to protect something else.

304
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:21,054
Except in a true dream world.

305
00:29:22,769 --> 00:29:24,354
You've got a point.

306
00:29:25,636 --> 00:29:28,764
<i>But... it's not a dream</i>

307
00:29:29,609 --> 00:29:30,818
<i>that you should interfere with!</i>

308
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:34,948
<i>Now.</i>

309
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,238
You could say that this world is

310
00:29:42,263 --> 00:29:45,162
Hashirama's paradox world.

311
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:46,524
<i>Damn it!</i>

312
00:29:50,193 --> 00:29:52,321
<i>What is this?!</i>

313
00:29:55,516 --> 00:29:57,518
In order to protect something...

314
00:29:57,639 --> 00:29:59,850
one must sacrifice something else.

315
00:30:00,222 --> 00:30:01,432
Stop, Madara!

316
00:30:02,304 --> 00:30:03,434
Don't go any further...

317
00:30:03,459 --> 00:30:08,125
"Be they a friend... sibling..."

318
00:30:08,783 --> 00:30:10,535
"or even my own child..."

319
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,647
I gave you plenty of time.

320
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:21,110
And I warned you...
that there wasn't much time left.

321
00:30:22,193 --> 00:30:23,820
How unfortunate.

322
00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:32,305
Madara!

323
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,791
What kind of man are you?!

324
00:30:55,215 --> 00:30:56,300
It's coming again!

325
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:10,869
My jutsu won't activate!

326
00:31:11,447 --> 00:31:13,074
<i>My chakra is—!</i>

327
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:17,215
I can't believe we've been stopped
by the likes of him...

328
00:31:20,543 --> 00:31:23,588
This strange thing...
It's blocking our way!

329
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,383
<i>It's using the Wood Style...</i>

330
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:26,801
<i>What is it?</i>

331
00:31:27,022 --> 00:31:31,818
I told you, I wouldn't let you
pass so easily.

332
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,868
By the way, isn't there anyone
who can give me

333
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,520
a serious answer to my question?

334
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:41,388
I asked you, what does
it feel like to take a dump?

335
00:31:45,508 --> 00:31:48,460
Well... I'm thinking it's like
the refreshing feeling you get

336
00:31:48,485 --> 00:31:50,801
after killing someone.

337
00:31:51,264 --> 00:31:53,725
All five elements at once?!

338
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,998
<i>How do we counter that?</i>

339
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:13,765
Impressive...

340
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:17,977
Using the same jutsu simultaneously
to cancel them out...

341
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,480
We're saved.

342
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,358
Don't underestimate Lord Third!

343
00:32:24,492 --> 00:32:28,225
<i>That said, everyone's exhausted
most of their chakra.</i>

344
00:32:29,037 --> 00:32:32,603
<i>Which leaves only a reanimated
Lord Third to fight back.</i>

345
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,642
<i>If Lord Third should fall,
we're done for...</i>

346
00:32:37,209 --> 00:32:41,046
<i>Forget Madara. We need to do
something about him.</i>

347
00:32:42,111 --> 00:32:43,154
<i>To be honest...</i>

348
00:32:43,371 --> 00:32:45,874
<i>Everyone needs to
start fighting as if</i>

349
00:32:46,128 --> 00:32:49,279
<i>Lady Tsunade, Shizune and I aren't able
to use medical ninjutsu anymore.</i>

350
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:53,638
<i>This large-scale battle using
big attacks is taking too long!</i>

351
00:32:53,969 --> 00:32:57,101
<i>And we haven't had
a chance to regroup.</i>

352
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:01,396
<i>We'll just have to trust young Naruto
to take care of Madara.</i>

353
00:33:05,173 --> 00:33:07,571
This is our chance, Lord Orochimaru!

354
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,982
Not yet.

355
00:33:14,256 --> 00:33:15,465
<i>This foe...</i>

356
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:17,704
No way!

357
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:19,606
Shh! Be quiet!

358
00:33:19,928 --> 00:33:22,138
No way! This is—!

359
00:33:22,822 --> 00:33:23,569
What is it?

360
00:33:24,772 --> 00:33:27,588
S-Sa...

361
00:33:28,114 --> 00:33:29,615
Did something happen to Sasuke?

362
00:33:31,024 --> 00:33:33,652
It seems I should do it
sooner than later, after all...

363
00:33:37,229 --> 00:33:38,397
What is it, Ino?

364
00:33:39,378 --> 00:33:40,087
Naruto!

365
00:33:40,464 --> 00:33:41,273
What?

366
00:33:47,237 --> 00:33:49,948
What is that?!
That's Lord Gaara's...!

367
00:33:50,705 --> 00:33:51,664
Over there!

368
00:33:55,553 --> 00:33:56,409
Naruto!

369
00:33:59,845 --> 00:34:01,931
There's no time to explain.

370
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:04,633
Hokage! Come with me!

371
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:08,026
Heal Naruto as much you can
while we're en route.

372
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:12,091
I've depleted my chakra.
I can't use medical ninjutsu anymore.

373
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:16,804
Take Sakura.
She can still help a little.

374
00:34:17,194 --> 00:34:20,072
How did Naruto
end up like this?!

375
00:34:20,713 --> 00:34:22,006
What happened over there?!

376
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:23,644
Just come!

377
00:34:23,999 --> 00:34:26,794
Don't waste time! I'll explain later!

378
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:29,564
Quickly, Sakura, get on the sand!

379
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:30,621
Right!

380
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,446
How could this happen?!

381
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:36,033
Is Naruto there?

382
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,825
Yeah! Over there!

383
00:34:38,404 --> 00:34:40,489
Can't you use your Byakugan?

384
00:34:41,362 --> 00:34:42,446
Did he bring down Madara?

385
00:34:58,491 --> 00:35:02,962
<i>Naruto's heartbeat...
is getting weaker and weaker!</i>

386
00:35:05,977 --> 00:35:06,978
Naruto!

387
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:15,441
Naruto Uzumaki...

388
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:20,493
We're talking about the Uzumaki Clan,
so I'm sure he's tenacious...

389
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,996
But trying to do anything
for him is useless.

390
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:27,880
A Jinchuriki dies when
the Tailed Beast is extracted.

391
00:35:29,038 --> 00:35:32,041
– That's an absolute rule!
– That's an absolute rule!

392
00:35:42,718 --> 00:35:45,012
The fact that you possess
such eyes proves

393
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:49,781
that you've continued to seek
something despite many great losses.

394
00:35:51,185 --> 00:35:53,354
But it all ends here.

395
00:35:54,184 --> 00:35:56,403
You will lose your very self.

396
00:35:57,807 --> 00:36:00,184
It's what they call a true ending.

397
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,837
I'm not dying.

398
00:36:14,155 --> 00:36:16,991
I... can't... die.

399
00:36:37,234 --> 00:36:42,280
I can't let Itachi's life... be in vain!

400
00:36:42,942 --> 00:36:46,488
<i>No matter what darkness or
contradictions lie within the village...</i>

401
00:36:47,103 --> 00:36:49,189
<i>I am still Itachi Uchiha
of the Leaf!</i>

402
00:36:50,595 --> 00:36:54,099
Not yet... not here...

403
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,217
Until I build a true village...

404
00:36:59,969 --> 00:37:02,221
and become a true Kage.

405
00:37:04,267 --> 00:37:05,385
I'm...

406
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:09,132
not going to die!

407
00:37:18,189 --> 00:37:20,733
Hang in there! Don't give up!

408
00:37:21,538 --> 00:37:25,959
You are strong! You will make it!

409
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,832
<i>My chakra's almost all...!</i>

410
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:42,345
S-Sasuke is—!

411
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,262
What's wrong, Karin?

412
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:48,377
Sasuke is really going to—!

413
00:37:48,441 --> 00:37:49,442
At this rate...

414
00:37:49,885 --> 00:37:51,358
At this rate, Naruto's going to...

415
00:37:51,626 --> 00:37:52,669
– ... die!
– ... die!

416
00:37:58,215 --> 00:37:59,719
<i>The Nine-Tails' chakra...</i>

417
00:38:10,434 --> 00:38:11,977
<i>No heartbeat or pulse...</i>

418
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:13,851
No way!

419
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,419
Hang in there, Naruto!

420
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,421
What's going on?!

421
00:38:18,446 --> 00:38:20,198
My medical ninjutsu isn't
working on him!

422
00:38:20,223 --> 00:38:22,934
It's probably because the Nine-Tails
has been extracted from him!

423
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,207
That's impossible!

424
00:38:25,232 --> 00:38:26,566
Madara got him.

425
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:28,634
But there's a way to save him!

426
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:31,267
That's why we're hurrying!

427
00:38:31,403 --> 00:38:32,237
To where?!

428
00:38:32,439 --> 00:38:34,308
To where the Fourth Hokage is.

429
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:38,607
<i>Hey, kid! Kazekage! Do me a favor!</i>

430
00:38:39,303 --> 00:38:40,346
<i>His father...</i>

431
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:45,740
<i>One-half of me is sealed inside
the Fourth Hokage, Minato.</i>

432
00:38:46,374 --> 00:38:50,378
<i>So transplant that other half
into Naruto. That will save him.</i>

433
00:38:51,101 --> 00:38:52,936
<i>Hurry to the Fourth Hokage!</i>

434
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:55,626
He has the Teleportation Jutsu.

435
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,966
Can't we just contact him over there
somehow and have him come here?

436
00:38:57,991 --> 00:38:59,158
<i>That won't work!</i>

437
00:38:59,401 --> 00:39:03,197
<i>His Teleportation Jutsu is written
into my Sealing Formula.</i>

438
00:39:03,488 --> 00:39:06,366
<i>Once I'm extracted,
it will disappear...</i>

439
00:39:08,065 --> 00:39:10,943
<i>Just rush Naruto over
to the Fourth Hokage.</i>

440
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,100
<i>Got that, Gaara?!</i>

441
00:39:13,363 --> 00:39:15,490
That's what Nine-Tails told me.

442
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:20,691
Right now, there's no other way
to save Naruto!

443
00:39:20,873 --> 00:39:22,790
How much longer 'til
we get there?

444
00:39:22,918 --> 00:39:24,420
Several kilometers!

445
00:39:29,043 --> 00:39:32,296
<i>I'll do whatever it takes
with what little chakra I have left!</i>

446
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,181
All right!

447
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:59,650
As long as I'm here,
I am not going to let you die!

448
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,154
I'm going to go at full speed!

449
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:08,046
Right!

450
00:40:14,382 --> 00:40:18,261
If I could just... save his soul
with my Forbidden Jutsu...

451
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,919
I can't sense any chakra
in him anymore.

452
00:40:23,026 --> 00:40:26,347
I can't even move my body...
let alone use Teleportation.

453
00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:28,160
Damn you, Madara!

454
00:40:33,107 --> 00:40:35,860
Whoa, you're not getting past me.

455
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:39,228
No one's answered my question yet.

456
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,241
Don't get in my way!

457
00:40:59,934 --> 00:41:01,921
I'm going to Sasuke!

458
00:41:01,946 --> 00:41:03,794
Move, you bastard!

459
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:06,213
You've got to be kidding!
Karin is amazing.

460
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:07,299
What is this?!

461
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:10,342
The same power as
Kushina Uzumaki's.

462
00:41:10,918 --> 00:41:12,920
<i>After all this time,
she's finally attained it...</i>

463
00:41:13,747 --> 00:41:14,729
Oh no...

464
00:41:15,178 --> 00:41:18,032
You just broke my little toy!

465
00:41:18,511 --> 00:41:20,610
Do not... underestimate me!

466
00:41:24,876 --> 00:41:25,852
<i>Double Blast!</i>

467
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,489
Not bad.

468
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:45,452
I can't move...

469
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:47,702
<i>A Curse Mark!</i>

470
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,258
Too bad!

471
00:41:51,496 --> 00:41:52,914
A-Amazing...

472
00:41:53,082 --> 00:41:55,960
Orochimaru... They got past it!

473
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:07,441
It's no big deal.

474
00:42:07,555 --> 00:42:10,850
It's too late even if
you go over there anyway.

475
00:42:11,158 --> 00:42:12,368
Are you all right, Karin?

476
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,491
Yeah... But never mind me.

477
00:42:15,641 --> 00:42:19,827
Sasuke! I can't sense Sasuke!

478
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:00,411
So this is Six Paths power...

479
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:04,206
Now, for that left eye.

480
00:43:22,799 --> 00:43:23,623
Who's there?!

481
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,020
There's someone else
where Sasuke is.

482
00:43:26,289 --> 00:43:28,208
Do you recognize the chakra?

483
00:43:29,771 --> 00:43:31,564
No! But...

484
00:43:32,248 --> 00:43:37,449
This chakra...
has a real nasty feel to it!

485
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,967
Let's head to the others with
the Power of Youth at full throttle!!

486
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,455
Lee! Tenten!

487
00:43:44,911 --> 00:43:48,957
Yes, sir! But you're falling over,
Guy-sensei!

488
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:52,311
Your body isn't keeping up
with your spirit!

489
00:43:57,935 --> 00:43:59,728
That's Gaara's sand...

490
00:44:00,093 --> 00:44:01,678
I think I saw Sakura too...

491
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,099
Why are they retreating?

492
00:44:05,951 --> 00:44:09,371
Kakashi hasn't overtaken
and passed us yet, has he?

493
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:10,648
No.

494
00:44:10,673 --> 00:44:13,092
The Nine-Tails' chakra we got
from Naruto has disappeared.

495
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:16,236
And Sakura, a medical ninja,
is on the move...

496
00:44:16,866 --> 00:44:20,529
I have a feeling something
is going down on Kakashi's side.

497
00:44:28,756 --> 00:44:31,176
I feel a little heavy.

498
00:44:31,709 --> 00:44:33,878
There's something catching
in my chest.

499
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:45,474
The Sage of
Six Paths' ninja Tools, eh?

500
00:44:45,771 --> 00:44:46,487
Useless.

501
00:44:47,845 --> 00:44:49,555
<i>But now I'm lighter.</i>

502
00:44:53,881 --> 00:44:57,051
What will we accomplish
by returning now?

503
00:44:57,597 --> 00:44:59,766
Tenten, don't grumble!

504
00:45:00,346 --> 00:45:04,600
I just have this gut feeling that
some unknown horror is approaching.

505
00:45:04,625 --> 00:45:05,334
Yes, sir.

506
00:45:13,684 --> 00:45:15,645
Are you two all right?!

507
00:45:15,709 --> 00:45:17,002
Yes...!

508
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:22,551
No way...

509
00:45:22,576 --> 00:45:25,054
These are definitely the—!

510
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:46,118
<i>You guys are stubborn too!</i>

511
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:49,872
Obito's consciousness is
no longer stable.

512
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:52,541
Let's go, Kakashi.

513
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:55,754
<i>Hold on, Minato!</i>

514
00:45:57,457 --> 00:45:59,960
<i>Switch your chakra to Sensory Mode!</i>

515
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,135
No way!

516
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:06,472
<i>We were distracted by
what was happening here.</i>

517
00:46:06,961 --> 00:46:10,606
<i>There's no mistake. My other
half has already been extracted!</i>

518
00:46:12,466 --> 00:46:13,467
Sensei?

519
00:46:18,634 --> 00:46:19,635
Kakashi-sensei!

520
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:24,156
What happened?

521
00:46:24,453 --> 00:46:26,622
The Nine-Tails was extracted
from Naruto!

522
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:28,368
At this rate he'll—!

523
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:33,957
Naruto...

524
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:39,630
Fourth Hokage, I bring a message
from Naruto's Nine-Tails!

525
00:46:39,655 --> 00:46:41,782
He said to seal the other
half of the Nine-Tails

526
00:46:41,807 --> 00:46:43,684
that you have within you into Naruto!

527
00:46:43,792 --> 00:46:45,835
That will save him!

528
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:48,138
<i>Oh...</i>

529
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,682
Kakashi, he's yours.

530
00:46:50,795 --> 00:46:51,796
I understand.

531
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,423
I'll help!

532
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,152
<i>The current me can...</i>

533
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:11,036
<i>This time for sure!</i>

534
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:17,305
What?

535
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:19,824
<i>That's—!</i>

536
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:22,881
<i>Nine-Tails...</i>

537
00:47:24,598 --> 00:47:28,518
<i>You're finally mine!</i>

538
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,722
What happened?!

539
00:47:49,053 --> 00:47:50,805
How's Naruto?!

540
00:47:53,676 --> 00:47:54,677
What was that?

541
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,375
No way...

542
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,360
<i>Lord Madara...</i>

543
00:48:05,636 --> 00:48:08,430
You're late, Black Zetsu...

544
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:13,098
I decided to come to you!

545
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:20,105
Zetsu... How long are you going
to cling to Obito?

546
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,107
<i>Sorry...</i>

547
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:27,487
<i>But that allowed me to steal Nine-Tails'
other half from these guys.</i>

548
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:31,074
Good. Now bring it,
and my left eye, to me.

549
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:34,494
<i>I sense Sage Power...</i>

550
00:48:35,425 --> 00:48:37,886
<i>And it's much stronger than
what Obito possessed.</i>

551
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:43,045
So the Fourth Hokage's Nine-Tails
is inside that black thing!

552
00:48:43,476 --> 00:48:44,477
Madara?!

553
00:48:44,694 --> 00:48:46,362
How did he get Six Paths' power?

554
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:04,921
<i>Since Lord Madara is here,
you can't do anything to me...</i>

555
00:49:04,946 --> 00:49:08,276
<i>even if I separate myself
from Obito.</i>

556
00:49:11,102 --> 00:49:12,051
Now, Kakashi!

557
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,470
<i>Why you—!</i>

558
00:49:32,495 --> 00:49:33,580
<i>You're still—!</i>

559
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,222
Not yet...

560
00:49:36,369 --> 00:49:38,784
I need to
ask you something, Madara.

561
00:49:41,215 --> 00:49:44,260
We need the Nine-Tails inside
that thing for Naruto.

562
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,400
We cannot afford to miss.

563
00:49:47,187 --> 00:49:49,231
We have to wait for
the right moment.

564
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:53,573
Just what am I... to you?

565
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,746
You're kidding, right?

566
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:02,582
What kind of stupid question is that,
at this point in time?

567
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:05,627
You are only one thing to me...

568
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:07,754
You are Madara.

569
00:50:09,125 --> 00:50:11,878
<i>Now go...</i>

570
00:50:12,879 --> 00:50:16,299
<i>Until the time when
I am revived...</i>

571
00:50:16,767 --> 00:50:21,007
<i>You shall be Madara Uchiha.</i>

572
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:25,731
Madara is he who rejects the world.

573
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,942
All who hold that in their heart...

574
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:34,156
and strive toward achieving
the Infinite Tsukuyomi are Madara.

575
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,534
I left you in charge of everything...

576
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:42,831
And let you act in my stead,
while I slept, waiting to return.

577
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:45,876
It's the path I guided you towards.

578
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:49,389
You were supposed to live out
your life as Madara

579
00:50:49,414 --> 00:50:51,666
in order to achieve our goal.

580
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:55,886
As the savior who rescued this world.

581
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:01,266
This world laid out by
the Sage of the Six Paths...

582
00:51:02,155 --> 00:51:03,239
has failed.

583
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:08,023
Now listen...

584
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:12,424
The chakra dispersed by the Six Paths was
originally meant to be a linking power.

585
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:17,176
The mental energies of people
would connect and feelings

586
00:51:17,201 --> 00:51:20,371
would be understood without
the need for words...

587
00:51:20,396 --> 00:51:22,565
That would lead to peace and stability.

588
00:51:23,672 --> 00:51:26,008
The one who preached this
as Ninshu, the Ninja Creed

589
00:51:26,033 --> 00:51:30,135
and sought to guide the people,
was the Sage of the Six Paths.

590
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,218
However...

591
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:39,179
But before long, people used chakra
not to connect with others

592
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:45,227
but only to combine the mental and
physical energies within themselves.

593
00:51:46,352 --> 00:51:50,397
Through a method of infusing one's
own chakra and increasing it multifold...

594
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:54,922
they changed chakra into ninjutsu
that could be used as weapons in battle.

595
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:59,060
Ironically reverting to the way
Six Paths' mother, Kaguya,

596
00:51:59,085 --> 00:52:02,630
had originally used chakra.

597
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:06,581
Just what the hell is
he talking about?!

598
00:52:07,132 --> 00:52:07,799
Gaara...

599
00:52:07,936 --> 00:52:09,312
I know.

600
00:52:09,845 --> 00:52:14,141
All the Sage of the Six Paths did was
to further the human paradox.

601
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:18,904
And even if bonds were established...

602
00:52:18,929 --> 00:52:22,807
All they learned was that
true understanding was not possible.

603
00:52:23,631 --> 00:52:29,220
In any case, chakra only gives rise
to conflict and false hope.

604
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:33,208
We all know the reality all too well...

605
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,801
Even as we seek peace,
we seek war.

606
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:39,739
And this reality compels
infinite suffering

607
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:42,784
through the power known as chakra.

608
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:46,288
Power leads to the desire for war.

609
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:49,416
And the lack of power leads
to losing everything.

610
00:52:50,062 --> 00:52:53,774
I will build a new world
that overcomes that!

611
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:57,010
Through the Infinite Tsukuyomi,

612
00:52:57,035 --> 00:53:00,539
I will create a dream world
without any abominable chakra!

613
00:53:01,544 --> 00:53:05,840
I, who possess the most
powerful chakra, shall lead it!

614
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:10,645
And you are not Obito,
but me... Madara himself.

615
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:17,485
Obito Uchiha with his Uchiha chakra,
challenged Kakashi Hatake,

616
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:20,822
desired the title of Hokage,
and yearned for Rin Nohara!

617
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:26,745
But because his power was false,
he ended up losing everything!

618
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:29,247
This is hell!

619
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:30,717
Have you forgotten?!

620
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:39,841
<i>Come over here.</i>

621
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:43,678
Yes, come, Madara!

622
00:53:44,083 --> 00:53:46,418
<i>From this day forth,
you are a savior.</i>

623
00:53:47,638 --> 00:53:50,377
You are still the savior, even now.

624
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:52,143
<i>Sand Wave!</i>

625
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:53,207
<i>Kamui!</i>

626
00:53:54,642 --> 00:53:55,643
<i>Sage Jutsu!</i>

627
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:00,654
<i>Rasengan!</i>

628
00:54:11,787 --> 00:54:13,485
No way...

629
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:15,332
Their combined attack...

630
00:54:22,421 --> 00:54:23,305
Now...

631
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,111
You damned...

632
00:54:41,916 --> 00:54:43,834
<i>What are you doing?!</i>

633
00:54:48,232 --> 00:54:50,151
One who leads others...

634
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:53,498
is one who never steps
over his friends' corpses...

635
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:56,793
even if his own ends up
being stepped on.

636
00:55:01,074 --> 00:55:06,496
Then in order to confirm that,
you'll have to become a corpse.

637
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:09,472
You won't be
stepping on me anymore.

638
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:14,227
I realize now that letting someone
handle everything in your name

639
00:55:14,855 --> 00:55:18,776
isn't the same as truly
entrusting them with the task.

640
00:55:19,458 --> 00:55:20,918
I am not you.

641
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:33,628
The current me...

642
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:38,084
is the one who wanted
to be Hokage... Obito Uchiha!

643
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:39,586
Obito...

644
00:55:44,771 --> 00:55:47,608
<i>Obito... You've finally found yourself!</i>

645
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,105
I passed through you.

646
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:02,067
That's your original right eye's power.

647
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:22,251
Are you trying to weaken me
by taking away the Tailed Beasts?

648
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:25,917
Do you think you can
challenge me and win?!

649
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:39,062
So weak...

650
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:42,857
Is that all? You only tore off a mere
sliver of the One-Tail and Eight-Tails?

651
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:48,655
Kakashi!

652
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:50,949
Take Naruto into the Time-Space!

653
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:55,870
<i>Obito plans to hand him
the Nine-Tails there!</i>

654
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,247
<i>Kamui!</i>

655
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:00,208
<i>Kamui!</i>

656
00:57:00,658 --> 00:57:04,058
<i>I know that when you teleport
your body materializes...</i>

657
00:57:11,846 --> 00:57:15,850
<i>If I try to teleport carelessly,
he'll come after me.</i>

658
00:57:16,405 --> 00:57:18,865
<i>My teleportation speed is too slow.</i>

659
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:21,771
Since he'd been in Sage mode once,

660
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:26,067
he was able to steal some
Sage Power from me too...

661
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:41,749
<i>Madara...</i>

662
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:45,044
<i>could have killed me at any time...</i>

663
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:48,442
<i>I was so scared I forgot to breathe!</i>

664
00:57:49,443 --> 00:57:53,072
<i>Of all the people,
he's in a different class!</i>

665
00:57:56,355 --> 00:57:57,940
All right, I transported Naruto.

666
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:00,518
All that's left is for you
to teleport yourself there

667
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,271
and Naruto will be saved, right, Obito?

668
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,315
Damn it.

669
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:09,027
You always talk down to me...

670
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:13,615
And act so superior...
Just like old times.

671
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:31,382
This time, I'll take point and
you'll be my backup, Kakashi.

672
00:58:32,378 --> 00:58:34,380
It's been a while since
we were a two-man squad.

673
00:58:35,256 --> 00:58:36,674
Don't stumble, Obito.

674
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:38,556
Are you prepared for this?

675
00:58:38,846 --> 00:58:39,847
Yeah...

676
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:42,310
I'm glad my final op will
have been with you.

677
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:46,272
Obito... Kakashi.

678
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:51,272
Obito, I'm taking back everything
I loaned you.

679
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:54,405
Especially that left eye...

680
00:58:55,101 --> 00:58:57,395
Are you worried, Madara?

681
00:58:57,759 --> 00:58:59,928
You told me once that
only with both together

682
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:02,841
could the Sharingan's true power
be unleashed.

683
00:59:03,077 --> 00:59:03,927
And so...

684
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:08,356
You're wrong. Those are Rinnegan,
not just Sharingan.

685
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:09,404
You're wrong.

686
00:59:11,762 --> 00:59:13,973
I was talking about these eyes.

687
00:59:14,901 --> 00:59:17,111
<i>In order to resurrect Naruto,</i>

688
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:18,946
<i>they need the Rinnegan
and the Nine-Tails.</i>

689
00:59:19,367 --> 00:59:20,827
<i>Obito has them both,</i>

690
00:59:20,852 --> 00:59:23,563
<i>so as long as I don't allow him
to teleport away to his time-space...</i>

691
00:59:24,506 --> 00:59:26,466
<i>And I've already discovered</i>

692
00:59:26,584 --> 00:59:29,795
<i>that my attacks are faster than
their Kamui's transfer speed.</i>

693
00:59:31,737 --> 00:59:37,028
<i>There's no doubt one of them
will try to distract me</i>

694
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:39,338
<i>while the other performs the Kamui.</i>

695
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:44,455
<i>Obito will teleport himself or
have Kakashi teleport him.</i>

696
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,641
<i>I should keep it fast and
simple with Limbo...</i>

697
00:59:46,869 --> 00:59:51,416
<i>No... I shouldn't use that as long as
Obito still has the Rinnegan.</i>

698
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:55,134
<i>Then I'll attack them
both simultaneously!</i>

699
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,098
<i>Kamui!</i>

700
01:00:09,401 --> 01:00:11,653
<i>They both released their Kamui
at the same time!</i>

701
01:00:12,065 --> 01:00:14,526
<i>And doubled the speed of the jutsu!</i>

702
01:00:16,296 --> 01:00:17,131
Obito!

703
01:00:17,344 --> 01:00:18,429
Don't worry.

704
01:00:19,552 --> 01:00:21,388
I'm here to help Naruto...

705
01:00:22,496 --> 01:00:23,497
Can I trust you?

706
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:28,499
Ever since I was a kid, I've never
been able to walk a straight path.

707
01:00:30,512 --> 01:00:35,099
But I've finally gotten to
where I needed to go.

708
01:00:47,522 --> 01:00:50,358
You actually had
perfect timing for once.

709
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,393
<i>Thanks for saving Kakashi...</i>

710
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:53,691
<i>Guy!</i>

711
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:55,318
Are you all right, Kakashi?!

712
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,782
I've seen you before.

713
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:04,702
Who is that?

714
01:01:10,401 --> 01:01:11,402
Sasuke!

715
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,381
Who is that guy?!

716
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:18,424
Hey you!

717
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:21,761
I don't know who the hell you are,
but what are you doing to Sasuke?

718
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,639
Oh, so that's what's going on...

719
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:25,672
Huh?

720
01:01:26,771 --> 01:01:28,277
So it was you...

721
01:01:28,977 --> 01:01:29,978
... Kabuto.

722
01:01:31,008 --> 01:01:33,488
I sensed a group rushing this way...

723
01:01:34,982 --> 01:01:37,110
It was you, after all, Lord Orochimaru.

724
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:38,820
That's Kabuto?!

725
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:40,154
His chakra is different!

726
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:41,406
Even his appearance.

727
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:45,576
He has taken in the chakra
of many people,

728
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:48,274
even Sage Jutsu chakra.

729
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,958
It's no wonder even you thought
he was someone else, Karin...

730
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:55,378
I wonder if his chakra
had a nasty feel to it

731
01:01:55,671 --> 01:01:59,258
because he still has
some of mine inside him?

732
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:02,814
– Or...
– Get away from Sasuke, you four-eyes!

733
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:07,432
What brings you here, Lord Orochimaru?

734
01:02:08,334 --> 01:02:09,586
I should ask you the same thing.

735
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:13,396
<i>What are you planning, Orochimaru?</i>

736
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:14,605
Mister Kabuto...

737
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:18,025
Don't tell me you're going
to absorb Sasuke?

738
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:22,385
And would that make you
Kabuke or Sasuto?

739
01:02:31,392 --> 01:02:33,599
You're the one who
did this to Sasuke?!

740
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:34,959
You bastard!

741
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:40,465
Suigetsu... I don't desire to
do that anymore.

742
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:44,886
Nor am I going to steal Sasuke, Karin.

743
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:47,346
<i>Sasuke's chakra!</i>

744
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:49,307
<i>I can faintly sense it!</i>

745
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:51,058
<i>No way!</i>

746
01:02:51,992 --> 01:02:54,578
Kabuto... You're helping Sasuke?

747
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:55,923
Yes.

748
01:02:56,515 --> 01:03:00,921
With my medical ninjutsu and
heavily modified cells of Hashirama,

749
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:03,321
along with a certain
someone's suggestion,

750
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:05,573
I managed to save his life.

751
01:03:06,553 --> 01:03:07,721
He's right.

752
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:08,923
Huh?!

753
01:03:09,279 --> 01:03:10,456
Well, well...

754
01:03:10,995 --> 01:03:14,248
if it isn't the man I most respect...

755
01:03:15,036 --> 01:03:16,736
the Second Hokage,
Lord Tobirama Senju.

756
01:03:17,767 --> 01:03:19,718
However, Kabuto...

757
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:22,030
You being here means that

758
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:27,345
you were able to slip out of the
infinite loop set up by Itachi's Izanami?

759
01:03:30,987 --> 01:03:31,988
You're right.

760
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:35,978
I was unable to acknowledge myself,
I didn't even know who I was.

761
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:40,733
That allowed you to give me
easy answers and use me.

762
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:42,443
Making me lose myself even more.

763
01:03:45,096 --> 01:03:47,766
But with that jutsu,
Itachi made me realize...

764
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:51,744
that I am none other... than Kabuto...

765
01:03:53,013 --> 01:03:54,556
... and where my home is.

766
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:00,461
Does it seem like the person inside

767
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:01,921
has changed too?

768
01:04:03,094 --> 01:04:05,221
That is the jutsu known as Izanami.

769
01:04:05,853 --> 01:04:08,564
The jutsu is set up so that
you cannot undo it

770
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:11,996
until you reflect upon yourself
and accept who you are.

771
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:14,971
Sasuke...

772
01:04:17,244 --> 01:04:23,109
Now I wish from the bottom of my heart
to not lose my home.

773
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:26,696
And Itachi, who wanted to
protect Sasuke even unto death...

774
01:04:27,290 --> 01:04:30,334
His feelings have pierced
through my heart strongly.

775
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:32,702
Hey!

776
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:34,453
Isn't it a little too late
to say things like that?

777
01:04:34,495 --> 01:04:36,789
You teamed up with that fake Madara!

778
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:39,458
You guys started this war!

779
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:45,631
You're right.

780
01:04:46,489 --> 01:04:48,074
Both Obito and I...

781
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:51,596
... thought we'd lost our place in this world.

782
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:53,014
And dragged everyone else into this.

783
01:04:53,764 --> 01:04:56,601
But, I now know who I am.

784
01:04:57,184 --> 01:04:59,145
And what I must do!

785
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:03,399
You may be reinforcements,
but you're nothing more than pebbles.

786
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:06,360
You won't make any difference
at this point.

787
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:08,905
That's Madara?!

788
01:05:09,113 --> 01:05:10,114
Yes, that's him.

789
01:05:11,803 --> 01:05:13,470
Kakashi, are you all right?

790
01:05:13,924 --> 01:05:15,926
Yes, thanks to Guy.

791
01:05:16,201 --> 01:05:18,120
I don't mean that.

792
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:20,917
I'm talking about my Sage Art
Rasengan hitting you earlier.

793
01:05:21,643 --> 01:05:22,909
That was okay too.

794
01:05:24,128 --> 01:05:27,447
I diverted it with my Kamui
just as it was making contact.

795
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:28,846
<i>Kamui!</i>

796
01:05:32,845 --> 01:05:33,846
I'm glad...

797
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:34,972
Sage Art?

798
01:05:35,389 --> 01:05:36,599
You mean, senjutsu?

799
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:38,017
Yes.

800
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:40,144
Only senjutsu works against him...

801
01:05:40,835 --> 01:05:42,066
As well as...

802
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:44,899
physical attacks such as taijutsu.

803
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:48,169
If I recall, Sensei,

804
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:49,404
senjutsu isn't your forte...

805
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:50,814
Yes.

806
01:05:50,859 --> 01:05:53,111
In all honesty, I'm weak in senjutsu.

807
01:05:53,699 --> 01:05:56,443
It takes me too long to infuse the chakra

808
01:05:56,468 --> 01:05:57,803
and I can't maintain it very long.

809
01:05:58,496 --> 01:06:00,970
I haven't used it very much
in combat either.

810
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:04,543
Furthermore, in this state,
I can't weave signs,

811
01:06:04,676 --> 01:06:07,054
so I don't think
I can even fight effectively.

812
01:06:10,514 --> 01:06:11,849
So, it's showtime

813
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:15,096
for the wild blue beast, eh?

814
01:06:17,014 --> 01:06:18,516
<i>Eight Inner Gates!</i>

815
01:06:19,077 --> 01:06:20,807
<i>Seventh Gate of Shock!</i>

816
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:22,812
Open!

817
01:06:24,188 --> 01:06:25,231
<i>Blue vapor?</i>

818
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:30,695
<i>Eight Inner Gates...</i>

819
01:06:31,028 --> 01:06:32,655
<i>One gate before the Gate of Death...</i>

820
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:35,866
<i>He insults me,</i>

821
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:37,576
<i>not bringing out the Red Vapor.</i>

822
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:44,834
Don't let the black spheres
or rod touch you!

823
01:06:51,048 --> 01:06:52,299
Take this!

824
01:06:53,467 --> 01:06:54,969
<i>Hirudora! Daytime Tiger!</i>

825
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:12,167
Kakashi, take the kunai!

826
01:07:12,192 --> 01:07:12,746
Right!

827
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:20,176
Rock Lee!

828
01:07:31,488 --> 01:07:32,989
How is Tenten?

829
01:07:33,869 --> 01:07:36,559
She wanted to check something out,
and made me go on ahead.

830
01:07:37,438 --> 01:07:39,149
Just when I was about to catch up...

831
01:07:39,198 --> 01:07:40,657
all of a sudden
the Hirudora appeared.

832
01:07:41,234 --> 01:07:42,652
Are you all right, Guy?

833
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:44,021
Yeah.

834
01:07:44,770 --> 01:07:47,453
Only my right arm and
a few ribs are hurt.

835
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:50,983
What are we going to do
if our last ray of hope, your taijutsu...

836
01:07:51,668 --> 01:07:52,753
is no good?

837
01:08:00,003 --> 01:08:01,838
He's... too strong.

838
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:03,245
Wait, Kakashi...

839
01:08:04,124 --> 01:08:06,474
It's too soon to decide
my taijutsu won't work!

840
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:07,500
But...

841
01:08:07,793 --> 01:08:10,421
Our youth hasn't faded yet!

842
01:08:11,508 --> 01:08:12,884
Do not lose hope!

843
01:08:18,039 --> 01:08:19,040
Guy-sensei...

844
01:08:19,553 --> 01:08:22,973
It's true that everything we wish for
will not come to be...

845
01:08:23,562 --> 01:08:25,565
But things that we must do

846
01:08:25,590 --> 01:08:28,176
must always begin with a wish.

847
01:08:28,658 --> 01:08:30,887
Just like the times I challenged you.

848
01:08:32,316 --> 01:08:34,110
<i>I challenge you, Kakashi!</i>

849
01:08:35,076 --> 01:08:38,121
And this is not a bluff.

850
01:08:38,606 --> 01:08:39,607
Don't tell me...

851
01:08:39,907 --> 01:08:41,158
you're going to—!

852
01:08:41,771 --> 01:08:44,315
The end has come for
the Leaf's Blue Beast...

853
01:08:45,216 --> 01:08:47,718
It's time for the Red Beast to emerge!

854
01:08:48,824 --> 01:08:51,535
No way... Not the final Gate of Death!

855
01:08:52,645 --> 01:08:54,438
Guy! Don't do that!

856
01:08:54,624 --> 01:08:55,875
Think it over hard!

857
01:08:56,276 --> 01:08:58,620
No one here wishes for that!

858
01:08:59,481 --> 01:09:00,774
Not even your father would...

859
01:09:00,825 --> 01:09:01,654
No!

860
01:09:01,793 --> 01:09:03,270
But I wish it.

861
01:09:03,795 --> 01:09:04,796
Guy-sensei!

862
01:09:05,236 --> 01:09:09,073
Do you really think it's that time?

863
01:09:09,558 --> 01:09:11,936
Lee, don't look at me like that.

864
01:09:13,031 --> 01:09:15,492
This time, you sit back
and enjoy the show!

865
01:09:17,003 --> 01:09:18,879
<i>You remind me of myself back then,</i>

866
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:22,192
<i>when I was a complete failure.</i>

867
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:24,451
<i>Now, in matches against
that elite genius Kakashi,</i>

868
01:09:24,476 --> 01:09:27,559
<i>we're nearly even.</i>

869
01:09:28,472 --> 01:09:31,183
<i>"Even if I cannot do ninjutsu or genjutsu...</i>

870
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:34,670
<i>I want to prove that can still
become a splendid ninja?"</i>

871
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:37,256
<i>Isn't that your ninja way?</i>

872
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:39,633
<i>That's a fine goal.</i>

873
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:42,511
<i>It's a goal worth fighting for.</i>

874
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:48,434
<i>So you must believe in your path
and run hard toward it!</i>

875
01:09:49,682 --> 01:09:53,227
<i>Become strong so I can just sit back
and enjoy the show!</i>

876
01:09:53,784 --> 01:09:56,320
Guy! You fool!

877
01:09:58,872 --> 01:10:00,715
I'm sorry, Papa...

878
01:10:00,828 --> 01:10:04,822
I'm already five years old,
but I can't even run 500 laps...

879
01:10:06,076 --> 01:10:07,678
Do not apologize!

880
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:09,371
I'm not scolding you because of that!

881
01:10:10,414 --> 01:10:12,208
Never apologize for trying hard!

882
01:10:12,632 --> 01:10:15,010
It's an insult to your determination, Guy!

883
01:10:15,127 --> 01:10:16,337
Then why?

884
01:10:16,565 --> 01:10:19,818
You're applying your self-rule
in the wrong manner!

885
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:23,260
Doing 500 laps will qualify you
for the vacant place in the academy?

886
01:10:23,588 --> 01:10:25,339
That's not a self-rule!

887
01:10:25,834 --> 01:10:27,502
That's just a wish!

888
01:10:27,704 --> 01:10:29,130
The kind you make a prayer for!

889
01:10:32,694 --> 01:10:33,656
You see,

890
01:10:34,271 --> 01:10:37,858
you impose a self-rule on yourself
to spur you on

891
01:10:38,093 --> 01:10:41,113
and help you overcome
a challenge or difficult situation.

892
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:44,531
You apply a self-rule on yourself only.

893
01:10:45,521 --> 01:10:47,440
Because of that rule,

894
01:10:47,527 --> 01:10:50,488
you are able to gather your strength
and focus on your efforts...

895
01:10:50,716 --> 01:10:52,723
So even if you fail,

896
01:10:52,748 --> 01:10:57,190
applying that rule keeps you
extremely disciplined and focused.

897
01:10:57,628 --> 01:11:01,006
That is the way a self-rule works.

898
01:11:01,465 --> 01:11:02,910
I'm sorry, Papa...

899
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:06,136
However, no one can find fault
in your determination.

900
01:11:06,523 --> 01:11:09,926
Even if you can only make it half way,
effort is effort.

901
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:12,394
And for that, you deserve a big hug!

902
01:11:13,914 --> 01:11:14,606
Papa!

903
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:16,438
Guy!

904
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:19,525
Oh... there they go again,
that father and son.

905
01:11:19,694 --> 01:11:21,529
Isn't that abuse?

906
01:11:21,879 --> 01:11:23,547
Anyway, what's with those bodysuits?

907
01:11:23,572 --> 01:11:24,782
Gross!

908
01:11:25,218 --> 01:11:26,803
Thank you for your support!

909
01:11:28,132 --> 01:11:30,509
Papa, I don't think that was support...

910
01:11:30,534 --> 01:11:32,411
Then, encouragement.

911
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:36,458
I guess... I can't do ninjutsu or genjutsu...

912
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:38,127
so that's why I failed the test...

913
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:39,336
Listen, Guy!

914
01:11:39,562 --> 01:11:41,865
Your youth has just begun!

915
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:43,841
Do not turn your back on your youth!

916
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:45,384
Just like me!

917
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:47,145
As your father,

918
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:51,786
I'm happy that ninjutsu
and genjutsu aren't your strong points!

919
01:11:53,951 --> 01:11:56,370
Knowing your shortcomings
will highlight your strengths!

920
01:11:56,556 --> 01:12:00,095
Your taijutsu is already
shining brilliantly!

921
01:12:00,604 --> 01:12:01,855
I'm very happy!

922
01:12:02,246 --> 01:12:05,956
I've discovered my own child's strengths
when he's still so young!

923
01:12:08,245 --> 01:12:10,669
Papa, you're just saying that, aren't you?

924
01:12:10,850 --> 01:12:12,351
Shortcomings can become strengths!

925
01:12:12,594 --> 01:12:14,513
Being repetitious is just being polite!

926
01:12:14,538 --> 01:12:16,623
To be loud is simply to be lively!

927
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:18,250
Obstinacy is merely earnestness!

928
01:12:18,415 --> 01:12:20,781
Those who are selfish are like cats!

929
01:12:21,065 --> 01:12:22,275
What about hairy people?

930
01:12:24,588 --> 01:12:26,089
Mmm... Th-They're like cats too!

931
01:12:26,434 --> 01:12:27,753
What about people with long torsos...?

932
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:30,683
Th-They're like cats!

933
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:32,619
Hey, Might Dai...

934
01:12:32,986 --> 01:12:35,613
Are you playing "training"
with your son again?

935
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:38,020
You sure work hard for a perennial Genin!

936
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:41,894
Yeah! Thanks for your support!

937
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:50,366
Damn it! Still trying to
act young at his age.

938
01:12:50,404 --> 01:12:51,066
Right?

939
01:12:51,527 --> 01:12:52,528
Oww!

940
01:12:52,922 --> 01:12:53,923
What?!

941
01:12:54,503 --> 01:12:57,206
Aren't you Dai's kid?!

942
01:12:57,450 --> 01:12:58,409
What's the big idea?

943
01:12:58,629 --> 01:13:00,672
Don't you ever say anything stupid
about my papa ever again!

944
01:13:00,697 --> 01:13:02,699
A fool is a fool.
I just spoke the truth.

945
01:13:02,724 --> 01:13:05,936
If you say one bad word about Papa,
I'll punch you five times!

946
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:08,226
That's my self-rule!

947
01:13:11,699 --> 01:13:13,698
Your self-rule? Interesting.

948
01:13:14,098 --> 01:13:15,194
So I'll say it.

949
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:18,018
Your dad is a good-for-nothing
who can't do ninjutsu or genjutsu,

950
01:13:18,018 --> 01:13:21,105
and can't even do taijutsu that well.

951
01:13:21,643 --> 01:13:22,894
You know what they say?

952
01:13:22,919 --> 01:13:25,838
He's more a comedian
than a Genin.

953
01:13:27,839 --> 01:13:31,088
Yeah, a comedian who
only tells jokes about youth isn't funny!

954
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,760
You said two bad things!

955
01:13:34,785 --> 01:13:36,495
That's ten punches!

956
01:13:36,813 --> 01:13:39,524
And we'll punch you 20 times!

957
01:13:46,824 --> 01:13:47,825
Damn it!

958
01:14:09,236 --> 01:14:11,572
I can't believe you couldn't
return a single punch

959
01:14:11,655 --> 01:14:13,490
after what they said about your father.

960
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:39,725
Guy, why did you do
such a thing?!

961
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:41,768
Papa...

962
01:14:42,394 --> 01:14:45,189
Papa... How can you stay
so positive and optimistic?

963
01:14:46,857 --> 01:14:48,650
When does one's youth
come to an end?

964
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:53,572
As long as you never turn your back
against youth, it never ends.

965
01:14:54,031 --> 01:14:56,580
Then are you saying your youth won't come
to an end when you die, Papa?!

966
01:14:56,605 --> 01:14:57,648
What are you saying, Guy?!

967
01:14:58,061 --> 01:15:00,230
That is when youth climaxes!

968
01:15:00,255 --> 01:15:01,798
When it burns the brightest!

969
01:15:02,053 --> 01:15:03,554
There's something wrong
with you, Papa!

970
01:15:03,795 --> 01:15:05,756
Youth doesn't matter
a bit when you die!

971
01:15:06,114 --> 01:15:07,740
You can believe in it until you die,

972
01:15:07,878 --> 01:15:10,297
but there's no guarantee you'll win
against someone strong!

973
01:15:10,888 --> 01:15:12,432
Just like me...

974
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:29,775
True victory isn't about winning
against someone strong.

975
01:15:30,495 --> 01:15:33,915
It's about defending
what's important to you!

976
01:15:38,483 --> 01:15:40,193
I just wanted...

977
01:15:44,408 --> 01:15:48,454
to protect this youth that
you always talk about!

978
01:16:00,347 --> 01:16:03,433
Now pay close attention, Guy.

979
01:16:13,264 --> 01:16:15,016
Father... What is this?!

980
01:16:15,427 --> 01:16:16,905
The Eight Inner Gates...

981
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:18,282
A type of Forbidden Jutsu!

982
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:22,995
<i>Father mastered such
a technique? When did he...?</i>

983
01:16:23,328 --> 01:16:25,789
As a Genin, I practiced every day,

984
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:28,875
and finally grasped this unique jutsu
after twenty years.

985
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:30,586
Twenty years!

986
01:16:31,159 --> 01:16:32,313
To put it plainly,

987
01:16:32,338 --> 01:16:35,219
this is the one and only jutsu that
I can pass on to you as your father.

988
01:16:35,253 --> 01:16:38,317
And it shall become
a most special technique to you!

989
01:16:39,388 --> 01:16:40,514
Special?

990
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:42,889
You have become
a splendid shinobi!

991
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:45,183
But I shall impose
one strict condition

992
01:16:45,208 --> 01:16:47,335
upon the use of this technique.

993
01:16:48,805 --> 01:16:50,098
A self-rule!

994
01:16:51,175 --> 01:16:52,843
A self-rule...

995
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:54,901
<i>Father...</i>

996
01:17:09,148 --> 01:17:12,527
<i>His chakra is spreading toward
the Death Gate's chakra point.</i>

997
01:17:19,837 --> 01:17:20,728
<i>Father...</i>

998
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:27,559
<i>The Eighth Gate... of Death!</i>

999
01:17:28,443 --> 01:17:30,486
It's no good... We're surrounded.

1000
01:17:30,757 --> 01:17:32,759
There's no way we can escape.

1001
01:17:33,023 --> 01:17:34,024
No way...

1002
01:17:34,362 --> 01:17:37,170
Aren't they the Seven Ninja
Swordsmen of the Mist?!

1003
01:17:38,028 --> 01:17:40,989
So even brats from other villages
know who we are?

1004
01:17:41,587 --> 01:17:43,687
We've gotten pretty famous.

1005
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:47,579
What's this? It's slight,
but the blade's gotten chipped!

1006
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:53,085
I have to let it suck some blood
and restore it with iron.

1007
01:17:54,294 --> 01:17:57,005
What'll we do? We can't take
them on by ourselves!

1008
01:17:58,465 --> 01:18:01,134
I made it just in time!

1009
01:18:01,259 --> 01:18:02,260
Father!

1010
01:18:04,304 --> 01:18:05,555
You're a Genin, Father!

1011
01:18:05,597 --> 01:18:06,765
What are you doing here?!

1012
01:18:06,807 --> 01:18:08,183
Never mind, just run away!

1013
01:18:08,356 --> 01:18:09,649
I'll buy you some time!

1014
01:18:10,205 --> 01:18:10,914
Run away?!

1015
01:18:11,061 --> 01:18:11,895
Father!

1016
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:15,524
They are Jonin, and on top of that,
they're the Seven Ninja Swordsmen!

1017
01:18:16,066 --> 01:18:18,594
You're no match for them!

1018
01:18:18,985 --> 01:18:22,030
I have the Gate of Death...
the Eight Inner Gates Formation!

1019
01:18:22,149 --> 01:18:23,626
But that's—!

1020
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:25,033
I'm going by my self-rule!

1021
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:29,037
<i>Now is the time...</i>

1022
01:18:29,413 --> 01:18:31,707
<i>Open! Eight Inner
Gates Formation!</i>

1023
01:18:32,082 --> 01:18:35,711
<i>... to protect something precious enough
to give your life for!</i>

1024
01:18:38,545 --> 01:18:40,880
Guy, are you really going to—!

1025
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:42,509
I can't believe this.

1026
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:46,304
Red vapor...

1027
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:51,268
The unique vapor of blood...
from the opening of all eight gates...

1028
01:18:52,558 --> 01:18:54,413
But actually seeing it
with my own eyes...

1029
01:18:54,438 --> 01:18:57,023
It's almost like the color
of dead autumn leaves

1030
01:18:57,065 --> 01:18:59,776
that have fallen off their tree...

1031
01:19:01,272 --> 01:19:02,607
You're right.

1032
01:19:02,779 --> 01:19:05,782
But they're not falling
for any reason or purpose...

1033
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:11,621
They become the nutrients...
for fresh green leaves!

1034
01:19:12,494 --> 01:19:14,832
And the period they bridge,

1035
01:19:14,857 --> 01:19:17,419
until the new spring
when fresh leaves bud...

1036
01:19:17,794 --> 01:19:21,465
... is the climax of youth!
When it burns most crimson!

1037
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:28,138
<i>Sekizo, Evening Elephant!</i>

1038
01:19:30,333 --> 01:19:31,292
<i>First Step!</i>

1039
01:19:56,082 --> 01:19:57,417
<i>Second Step!</i>

1040
01:20:02,255 --> 01:20:03,381
He stopped midway?!

1041
01:20:04,191 --> 01:20:06,693
<i>The Evening Elephant is supposed
to be a continuous attack</i>

1042
01:20:06,718 --> 01:20:08,970
<i>that can be shifted up in speed
from one to five times...</i>

1043
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:14,142
<i>I see, what unbelievable pain.</i>

1044
01:20:14,643 --> 01:20:16,228
<i>But I've acclimated.</i>

1045
01:20:16,937 --> 01:20:19,856
<i>Next time, I can keep it going without
giving him any openings.</i>

1046
01:20:20,315 --> 01:20:22,150
<i>Great stress is placed on
the body even through</i>

1047
01:20:22,192 --> 01:20:24,152
<i>the Fifth Gate, the Gate of Closing...</i>

1048
01:20:25,239 --> 01:20:27,210
<i>I bet the Gate of Death's
level of pain</i>

1049
01:20:27,235 --> 01:20:30,113
<i>is something that exceeds
my imagination!</i>

1050
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:42,806
A taijutsu move that bombards
with blows of punched air...

1051
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:45,091
An air cannon, so to speak...

1052
01:20:51,206 --> 01:20:54,403
<i>Taking four or five of those
would be bad.</i>

1053
01:20:55,475 --> 01:21:00,605
<i>I should definitely avoid getting hit
by the fists creating them too.</i>

1054
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:09,072
One rarely gets to fight
the Eight Inner Gates Formation!

1055
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:11,324
I'm game! I'll play with you!

1056
01:21:15,239 --> 01:21:17,616
He's coming towards me
by kicking air!

1057
01:21:18,915 --> 01:21:21,001
Lee, are you—?

1058
01:21:21,042 --> 01:21:22,419
I am not sad!

1059
01:21:24,629 --> 01:21:27,424
Showing any pity or sorrow
to someone

1060
01:21:27,465 --> 01:21:30,135
who has resolved himself
would be an insult!

1061
01:21:31,344 --> 01:21:32,888
We must assist Guy.

1062
01:21:32,971 --> 01:21:33,972
Listen up.

1063
01:21:36,099 --> 01:21:36,808
Sensei...

1064
01:21:37,058 --> 01:21:39,519
Those black weapons of his
are troublesome...

1065
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:41,938
They're not the activating-from
-Nothing type,

1066
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:44,733
but an always-on-standby
type that undergo Change in Form.

1067
01:21:45,108 --> 01:21:46,651
Their impact points disappear,

1068
01:21:47,110 --> 01:21:49,988
but there is clear sensation
if they make contact with you.

1069
01:21:51,197 --> 01:21:53,783
Also, he can only send them
about 70 meters out.

1070
01:21:54,701 --> 01:21:57,162
Any further than that,
and he'll lose control over them.

1071
01:21:59,205 --> 01:22:02,250
Since they actually exist and
can be seen with the eye,

1072
01:22:02,575 --> 01:22:04,660
your Kamui should work on them.

1073
01:22:05,254 --> 01:22:07,590
By sending them away,

1074
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:09,799
we can prevent Madara from
controlling them.

1075
01:22:10,216 --> 01:22:14,304
To be honest, I'm beginning
to lose sight in my left eye.

1076
01:22:14,852 --> 01:22:18,224
I'll have to get pretty close to
target my Kamui accurately.

1077
01:22:19,309 --> 01:22:21,811
Gaara, can you prepare some sand?

1078
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:25,649
You want me to transport Kakashi
with my sand, right?

1079
01:22:25,732 --> 01:22:28,985
But my sand isn't fast enough
to avoid his attacks.

1080
01:22:29,319 --> 01:22:30,320
Don't worry.

1081
01:22:30,403 --> 01:22:31,404
That's where I come in.

1082
01:22:32,226 --> 01:22:34,228
I'll have Kakashi carry
one of my kunai.

1083
01:22:34,549 --> 01:22:36,926
<i>Eight Inner Gates:
The Sixth Gate of Joy!</i>

1084
01:22:37,150 --> 01:22:38,151
<i>Open!</i>

1085
01:22:42,332 --> 01:22:43,282
Lee!

1086
01:22:43,307 --> 01:22:44,809
You've mastered
the Eight Inner Gates too?!

1087
01:22:45,001 --> 01:22:47,379
I can only open up to
the Sixth Gate...

1088
01:22:47,837 --> 01:22:51,883
I've never cursed my own lack
of power as I do now!

1089
01:22:52,256 --> 01:22:54,884
No... That's enough, Lee.

1090
01:22:56,719 --> 01:22:58,012
Because you're still...

1091
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:02,394
... a fresh new leaf Guy wants
to risk his life to protect!

1092
01:23:07,524 --> 01:23:11,486
Lee, I want you to stay here
to support and guard Gaara.

1093
01:23:11,862 --> 01:23:14,281
And one more thing...
Take one of my kunai.

1094
01:23:22,497 --> 01:23:23,373
<i>First Step!</i>

1095
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:24,499
He is fast!

1096
01:23:29,921 --> 01:23:30,922
<i>Second Step!</i>

1097
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:34,342
<i>Third Step!</i>

1098
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:35,552
<i>Fourth Step!</i>

1099
01:23:39,139 --> 01:23:40,140
<i>I can't move!</i>

1100
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:42,559
<i>Fifth Step!</i>

1101
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:44,936
Just keep going, Guy!
No matter what!

1102
01:23:45,228 --> 01:23:46,229
<i>Here he comes!</i>

1103
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:56,406
<i>Great timing, Lee!</i>

1104
01:24:01,494 --> 01:24:02,495
<i>Kamui!</i>

1105
01:24:46,980 --> 01:24:49,942
You're the first since Hashirama
to make me feel this excited!

1106
01:24:50,877 --> 01:24:52,128
Can you still dance?

1107
01:24:52,799 --> 01:24:55,093
Do you have any
other techniques?

1108
01:24:55,174 --> 01:24:57,259
Give me some more fun!

1109
01:24:58,019 --> 01:25:01,314
<i>He got up from a barrage of Sekizo?</i>

1110
01:25:05,475 --> 01:25:06,476
Where am I?

1111
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:09,604
Did I die?

1112
01:25:11,731 --> 01:25:13,733
What makes thee think
that thou art dead?

1113
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:18,613
Thine ethical viewpoint
on death differs much

1114
01:25:18,655 --> 01:25:20,907
from that which prevailed
in my time...

1115
01:25:21,446 --> 01:25:24,785
To so easily replace oneself
with the term "death"...

1116
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:27,747
Thou must gain mettle,
oh fledgling.

1117
01:25:29,541 --> 01:25:30,542
Who are you?

1118
01:25:31,023 --> 01:25:33,943
'Tis quite a precise query
for this place, but...

1119
01:25:34,379 --> 01:25:37,257
I am quite uneasy over
whether thou shalt be able

1120
01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:40,343
to connect my name with
my actions as a herald...

1121
01:25:44,347 --> 01:25:47,142
I am he who shall achieve
peace and order...

1122
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,561
My name is Hagoromo.

1123
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:57,777
On the other hand...

1124
01:25:58,153 --> 01:25:59,696
I had foreseen

1125
01:25:59,737 --> 01:26:03,116
that thou wouldst end up
in such a state as that.

1126
01:26:03,867 --> 01:26:07,120
<i>Uh... I don't understand
what the hell he's saying.</i>

1127
01:26:07,576 --> 01:26:11,369
<i>He seems to be one of
those lecturing geezers!</i>

1128
01:26:13,015 --> 01:26:15,540
Hey, Gramps, sorry.
But, I...

1129
01:26:16,045 --> 01:26:17,046
Now then...

1130
01:26:17,255 --> 01:26:18,506
Hey! Those eyes!

1131
01:26:19,299 --> 01:26:20,300
Rinnegan!

1132
01:26:20,967 --> 01:26:24,179
Thou dost appear to
possess observant eyes.

1133
01:26:24,859 --> 01:26:26,865
All that remains is for thee

1134
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:28,975
to pragmatically comprehend
thy circumstances.

1135
01:26:30,007 --> 01:26:32,090
Thou hast not died yet...

1136
01:26:32,883 --> 01:26:35,148
This place is within thy mind.

1137
01:26:35,481 --> 01:26:36,649
I understand thine haste,

1138
01:26:36,649 --> 01:26:38,193
– <i>This geezer's not an enemy?</i>
– but at this moment,

1139
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:39,777
– <i>This geezer's not an enemy?</i>
– rushing will accomplish naught.

1140
01:26:39,777 --> 01:26:40,778
<i>But...</i>

1141
01:26:41,906 --> 01:26:46,259
Can't you speak a little more smoothly,
using easy, normal words?

1142
01:26:46,284 --> 01:26:48,703
I am an anachronism.

1143
01:26:49,301 --> 01:26:51,386
Over the passage of much time,

1144
01:26:51,411 --> 01:26:53,516
cultural traditions and
notions, and ethics

1145
01:26:53,833 --> 01:26:56,987
have brought about
significant change.

1146
01:26:58,046 --> 01:27:01,222
Each occurrence where I cross
time and meet a reincarnate,

1147
01:27:01,713 --> 01:27:05,733
I have come to sense greatly the
differences between the other and myself...

1148
01:27:06,721 --> 01:27:09,807
I was also able to regulate
things systematically and

1149
01:27:09,849 --> 01:27:11,351
learn new mores and words, however...

1150
01:27:12,354 --> 01:27:13,897
Shut up already!

1151
01:27:14,312 --> 01:27:16,481
I don't have the time
to be sitting around

1152
01:27:16,522 --> 01:27:18,358
and listening to
some weird geezer!

1153
01:27:18,771 --> 01:27:20,401
Not just searching for words...

1154
01:27:20,501 --> 01:27:23,629
But there is ambiguity
in scholarship.

1155
01:27:24,364 --> 01:27:26,449
If communication of wills
cannot be achieved

1156
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:28,785
in addition to difficulty of definition...

1157
01:27:29,494 --> 01:27:32,121
I see that I must speak simply...

1158
01:27:32,163 --> 01:27:36,757
taking into account current idealistic
and materialistic thinking.

1159
01:27:36,782 --> 01:27:38,825
Are you an alien or something?

1160
01:27:39,235 --> 01:27:41,464
I mean, you seem
super dignified, but...

1161
01:27:44,425 --> 01:27:46,094
Uh, that's a bit much, doncha think?

1162
01:27:46,219 --> 01:27:47,720
An alien? Seriously?

1163
01:27:52,392 --> 01:27:55,728
Well, maybe that ain't too far off.
So anyway...

1164
01:27:59,958 --> 01:28:01,495
Do you still fail to understand me?

1165
01:28:01,935 --> 01:28:04,801
To think that conversation would
pose such a complex challenge...

1166
01:28:05,071 --> 01:28:08,950
No! Keep talking like just now.
I finally get you!

1167
01:28:09,367 --> 01:28:11,312
I was just shocked because

1168
01:28:11,337 --> 01:28:14,038
your speaking style
changed so drastically, ya know?

1169
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:15,581
Oh, for real?

1170
01:28:15,837 --> 01:28:19,257
Then I'll keep going like this.
I appreciate it!

1171
01:28:22,785 --> 01:28:24,037
Uh, yeah.

1172
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:27,051
Oh but, those words don't match up
with your face at all,

1173
01:28:27,093 --> 01:28:28,720
so it's kind of super-scary...

1174
01:28:29,095 --> 01:28:30,972
<i>And he loses all dignity too.</i>

1175
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:35,935
You should be just a bit more formal.

1176
01:28:36,270 --> 01:28:37,939
Otherwise, you come off
kind of dumb.

1177
01:28:38,314 --> 01:28:40,149
Now you're going too far, no?

1178
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:41,816
What do you mean by dumb?!

1179
01:28:42,567 --> 01:28:44,610
Well, considering how
I was talking before,

1180
01:28:44,652 --> 01:28:46,446
I guess I can't blame you for that.

1181
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,741
So how's this then?

1182
01:28:50,283 --> 01:28:52,744
That's it! All right!
That's perfect!

1183
01:28:53,153 --> 01:28:55,948
Indeed. I'm getting
the hang of it too.

1184
01:28:56,197 --> 01:28:58,855
Finally, I can talk with you.

1185
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:01,252
So anyway, Gramps, who are you?

1186
01:29:01,687 --> 01:29:03,272
If you know a lot about this place,

1187
01:29:03,504 --> 01:29:05,798
tell me how to get out of here!

1188
01:29:06,508 --> 01:29:08,093
Don't ask so many questions
all at once!

1189
01:29:08,648 --> 01:29:11,815
I am a person of the past,
someone long dead.

1190
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,932
A monk who wanders through
this world as chakra,

1191
01:29:14,974 --> 01:29:18,811
crossing generations, ascertaining
the course of Ninshu, the Ninja Creed.

1192
01:29:19,891 --> 01:29:23,649
My name is Hagoromo,
the founder of the Ninja Creed.

1193
01:29:23,691 --> 01:29:25,902
I'm also known as
the Sage of Six Paths.

1194
01:29:26,152 --> 01:29:27,862
What?! The Sage of Six Paths?!

1195
01:29:28,613 --> 01:29:33,117
The sage from the legends that
Pervy Sage and Nagato talked about?

1196
01:29:33,837 --> 01:29:35,589
Oh, so you know about me?

1197
01:29:35,626 --> 01:29:36,988
Of course, I do!

1198
01:29:37,305 --> 01:29:39,557
You're the one who
created ninjutsu, right?

1199
01:29:39,984 --> 01:29:42,027
Not ninjutsu...
Ninshu, the Ninja Creed.

1200
01:29:42,543 --> 01:29:45,963
My Ninja Creed was something
meant to inspire hope.

1201
01:29:46,766 --> 01:29:49,895
Do not confuse it with ninjutsu
which breeds conflict!

1202
01:29:50,610 --> 01:29:53,154
In any case, if you're the sage,

1203
01:29:53,179 --> 01:29:54,889
I've got tons of things
I want to ask you.

1204
01:29:55,307 --> 01:29:56,284
But first, right now...

1205
01:30:09,569 --> 01:30:12,864
Anyway, the conditions are
all in place now.

1206
01:30:13,324 --> 01:30:17,203
Quit speaking in riddles and
let me out of here!

1207
01:30:18,194 --> 01:30:21,572
Forgive me... That is something I have
no influence over.

1208
01:30:22,453 --> 01:30:24,914
That depends on the actions
of those outside.

1209
01:30:25,657 --> 01:30:27,701
I can only relay things to you.

1210
01:30:28,589 --> 01:30:31,801
I'm not getting what
you're saying again!

1211
01:30:32,724 --> 01:30:33,767
It means right now,

1212
01:30:33,792 --> 01:30:36,962
trying to rush won't make
any difference.

1213
01:30:37,666 --> 01:30:39,460
So I want you to listen for a bit...

1214
01:30:39,798 --> 01:30:42,284
No, you must listen...

1215
01:30:43,370 --> 01:30:46,581
First, about my mother and sons.

1216
01:30:53,798 --> 01:30:57,176
My mother, Kaguya Otsutsuki,

1217
01:30:57,201 --> 01:31:00,121
came to this land of yours
from a faraway place.

1218
01:31:00,371 --> 01:31:02,540
She came in search of
the fruit of the Divine Tree.

1219
01:31:03,412 --> 01:31:06,212
The chakra fruit of
that same Divine Tree,

1220
01:31:06,878 --> 01:31:08,379
that you have seen in this war.

1221
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:14,969
Kaguya consumed the fruit,
attained power, and subdued this land.

1222
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:17,586
Where'd Kaguya come from?

1223
01:31:18,167 --> 01:31:19,877
Is she stronger than you,
Sage of Six Paths?

1224
01:31:20,057 --> 01:31:23,394
I guess all moms are scary
when they're mad, huh?

1225
01:31:23,978 --> 01:31:26,731
It matters not where
she came from.

1226
01:31:27,464 --> 01:31:30,508
Mother was powerful...
More powerful than any other.

1227
01:31:31,903 --> 01:31:34,605
Some called my mother
the Rabbit Goddess

1228
01:31:34,630 --> 01:31:35,749
and others considered her
a demon...

1229
01:31:35,774 --> 01:31:37,609
They both worshiped her
and feared her.

1230
01:31:38,711 --> 01:31:41,422
Later, Kaguya would birth two sons.

1231
01:31:42,246 --> 01:31:44,138
I was one of them.

1232
01:31:45,374 --> 01:31:49,253
We brothers, to atone for
the crimes mother left behind,

1233
01:31:49,295 --> 01:31:51,839
battled Ten-Tails, an incarnation
of the Divine Tree,

1234
01:31:51,881 --> 01:31:54,133
and sealed it inside me.

1235
01:31:55,676 --> 01:31:57,929
The Divine Tree,
robbed of its Chakra Fruit,

1236
01:31:57,970 --> 01:32:00,932
went on a rampage in
an attempt to recover it.

1237
01:32:02,141 --> 01:32:07,063
Much, much later,
I had two sons of my own.

1238
01:32:07,104 --> 01:32:10,525
I named the elder, Indra,
and the younger, Ashura,

1239
01:32:10,566 --> 01:32:13,319
and I taught them
the Ninja Creed.

1240
01:32:14,445 --> 01:32:17,573
But there was a huge difference
between the two.

1241
01:32:17,989 --> 01:32:22,141
One possessed genes containing my
powerful chakra and the other did not.

1242
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:26,249
And this difference manifested
itself extremely.

1243
01:32:26,624 --> 01:32:29,418
It's getting complicated again,
ya know?

1244
01:32:29,703 --> 01:32:31,038
What does this all mean?

1245
01:32:31,295 --> 01:32:32,318
In short...

1246
01:32:32,713 --> 01:32:35,341
There was the exceptional
older brother, Indra...

1247
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:37,760
and the dunce
younger brother, Ashura.

1248
01:32:38,553 --> 01:32:40,513
A dunce, huh?

1249
01:32:41,082 --> 01:32:43,436
Even though his dad's
the Sage of Six Paths?

1250
01:32:44,725 --> 01:32:47,592
Perhaps there's no need
to say this to you, but...

1251
01:32:48,271 --> 01:32:50,479
No matter how exceptional
both parents may be,

1252
01:32:50,922 --> 01:32:53,800
there's no guarantee one will inherit
either of their abilities outright.

1253
01:32:54,608 --> 01:32:56,109
Sound familiar?

1254
01:32:57,655 --> 01:33:01,200
Just as it seems to have been
in your case, Naruto.

1255
01:33:03,828 --> 01:33:06,247
For some reason,
I understand that completely.

1256
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:14,046
And you are truly similar
to Ashura, in your actions as well.

1257
01:33:14,255 --> 01:33:16,841
Huh? My actions?

1258
01:33:17,717 --> 01:33:20,970
Indra and Ashura walked
different paths in life.

1259
01:33:21,637 --> 01:33:24,974
Elder brother, Indra, possessed
strong visual prowess

1260
01:33:25,016 --> 01:33:28,644
and senses from birth,
and was called a genius.

1261
01:33:28,891 --> 01:33:33,024
He always did everything alone,
leaning only on his own strength

1262
01:33:33,065 --> 01:33:35,776
and came to understand that his powers
were different and special.

1263
01:33:35,927 --> 01:33:39,723
He perceived that power could
achieve everything.

1264
01:33:39,981 --> 01:33:43,798
On the other hand, nothing ever went well
for the younger brother, Ashura,

1265
01:33:43,823 --> 01:33:45,242
from the time he was young.

1266
01:33:45,267 --> 01:33:47,520
And he couldn't do anything
on his own.

1267
01:33:48,072 --> 01:33:50,459
In order to attain the same power
as his older brother,

1268
01:33:50,809 --> 01:33:55,211
he needed the cooperation of others
in addition to his own effort.

1269
01:33:55,755 --> 01:33:58,476
While struggling through training,

1270
01:33:58,501 --> 01:34:00,712
the power of bodily chakra awakened
within Ashura

1271
01:34:00,926 --> 01:34:03,262
and he attained power
rivaling his brother's.

1272
01:34:03,554 --> 01:34:06,474
He came to understand that
he was able to become strong,

1273
01:34:06,499 --> 01:34:09,044
thanks to the cooperation and
help of those around him.

1274
01:34:12,605 --> 01:34:16,776
He learned of the love for others that
arises from thinking about others...

1275
01:34:16,817 --> 01:34:20,613
And perceived that it was love
that can achieve everything.

1276
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:26,869
In the way that the younger one
chose to live his life...

1277
01:34:26,911 --> 01:34:30,498
I thought I caught a glimpse
of new possibilities.

1278
01:34:30,831 --> 01:34:34,043
I partitioned the power of
the Ten-Tails inside of me,

1279
01:34:34,085 --> 01:34:35,795
and named each of the pieces...

1280
01:34:35,836 --> 01:34:40,883
And believed that the bond known
as "cooperation" was true power.

1281
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:47,886
I then named
the younger brother, Ashura,

1282
01:34:47,911 --> 01:34:51,217
the leader and guardian
of the Ninja Creed,

1283
01:34:52,153 --> 01:34:56,502
believing that his elder brother, Indra,
would cooperate with his younger brother.

1284
01:34:57,897 --> 01:34:58,674
However...

1285
01:35:02,435 --> 01:35:05,207
Indra did not accept my decision.

1286
01:35:06,089 --> 01:35:07,566
And thus from that day on,

1287
01:35:09,245 --> 01:35:12,331
... interminable conflict began.

1288
01:35:16,905 --> 01:35:21,382
Even after their flesh perished,
the chakra the two honed

1289
01:35:21,407 --> 01:35:24,575
continued to reincarnate across time,

1290
01:35:24,785 --> 01:35:26,762
without vanishing...
over and over.

1291
01:35:27,221 --> 01:35:30,599
It kind of sounds like being
haunted by a ghost. It's creepy.

1292
01:35:30,875 --> 01:35:33,920
So, is it still possessing
someone even now?

1293
01:35:34,900 --> 01:35:36,860
It's you, Naruto.

1294
01:35:39,198 --> 01:35:42,651
The younger brother Ashura has
reincarnated as you.

1295
01:35:48,909 --> 01:35:51,667
You don't seem too surprised.

1296
01:35:52,204 --> 01:35:57,208
Perhaps, you have sensed
Ashura's presence inside you already?

1297
01:36:00,296 --> 01:36:04,884
I thought as much.
Then you must know already...

1298
01:36:05,239 --> 01:36:08,220
who is the reincarnate
of the older one, Indra...

1299
01:36:14,973 --> 01:36:16,058
Sasuke...

1300
01:36:17,032 --> 01:36:20,494
Yes. You sensed it, after all.

1301
01:36:21,192 --> 01:36:24,111
It seems that there were
other reincarnates

1302
01:36:24,111 --> 01:36:26,363
besides Sasuke and me...

1303
01:36:26,442 --> 01:36:28,360
Who were the others?

1304
01:36:29,742 --> 01:36:34,622
The first generation of reincarnates
were Hashirama Senju and Madara Uchiha.

1305
01:36:35,915 --> 01:36:39,001
Hashirama was Ashura.
Madara was Indra.

1306
01:36:39,378 --> 01:36:41,898
You know how they ended up.

1307
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:45,966
However, before Madara could end
his life as a reincarnate,

1308
01:36:46,008 --> 01:36:47,968
he created a certain problem.

1309
01:36:48,177 --> 01:36:52,848
Madara was so obsessed with power
that he stole some of Hashirama's cells.

1310
01:36:53,302 --> 01:36:56,680
Which, in short, caused the merging

1311
01:36:57,016 --> 01:37:01,106
of a portion of Ashura's chakra
with Indra's chakra...

1312
01:37:01,148 --> 01:37:05,402
And the result was that
it essentially became my own chakra.

1313
01:37:06,068 --> 01:37:09,488
That's right,
he awakened the Rinnegan.

1314
01:37:11,826 --> 01:37:15,127
I always thought that someone
like that would appear

1315
01:37:15,152 --> 01:37:18,781
among either Indra
or his reincarnates.

1316
01:37:19,166 --> 01:37:21,317
Hence, I left behind
the stone tablet

1317
01:37:21,342 --> 01:37:24,345
that contained my writings
on how to deal with this.

1318
01:37:25,965 --> 01:37:28,676
Although, it seems no one could
understand its meaning...

1319
01:37:28,701 --> 01:37:31,246
So, Six Paths Gramps, you've been watching

1320
01:37:31,271 --> 01:37:34,733
your kids' sibling rivalry
all this time?

1321
01:37:35,521 --> 01:37:37,231
Yes, I suppose you could say that.

1322
01:37:39,770 --> 01:37:40,771
I see...

1323
01:37:40,938 --> 01:37:43,158
Through Ninshu,

1324
01:37:43,243 --> 01:37:45,673
I preached that chakra is the power
that links individuals.

1325
01:37:46,026 --> 01:37:48,612
I strongly believe that chakra
should not be something

1326
01:37:48,612 --> 01:37:52,700
that amplifies the strength
of one person alone.

1327
01:37:54,702 --> 01:37:58,118
Even after my mother, Kaguya,
put an end to chaotic times,

1328
01:37:58,249 --> 01:38:00,710
she ruled with her power alone.

1329
01:38:01,045 --> 01:38:04,383
However, my mother's power
bred arrogance within her.

1330
01:38:04,408 --> 01:38:08,371
And mankind began to dread
the existence of that power.

1331
01:38:09,049 --> 01:38:12,094
That is why my mother,
once known as the Rabbit Goddess,

1332
01:38:12,119 --> 01:38:15,998
became feared as a demon.

1333
01:38:16,875 --> 01:38:19,349
When power is concentrated
in one person,

1334
01:38:19,374 --> 01:38:23,462
that power runs rampant and
in time, it possesses the person.

1335
01:38:23,856 --> 01:38:26,442
The current Madara is
a prime example of that...

1336
01:38:26,483 --> 01:38:28,903
He's become just like
my mother, Kaguya.

1337
01:38:29,285 --> 01:38:31,978
Now, he's no longer
Indra's incarnate.

1338
01:38:32,152 --> 01:38:35,029
He's obtained Ten-Tails' power
and is getting close to me.

1339
01:38:35,118 --> 01:38:38,997
And he is trying to obtain even
my mother Kaguya's power.

1340
01:38:39,890 --> 01:38:44,367
The Infinite Tsukuyomi doesn't
just cast genjutsu over you.

1341
01:38:44,627 --> 01:38:47,004
It keeps you trapped
inside genjutsu dreams,

1342
01:38:47,046 --> 01:38:50,591
so that the caster can use your
individual power while keeping you alive.

1343
01:38:50,633 --> 01:38:55,596
You're attached to the roots of the
Divine Tree, and turned into living slaves.

1344
01:38:56,407 --> 01:39:00,495
Mother possessed the power
of Sharingan as well as Byakugan.

1345
01:39:00,797 --> 01:39:04,827
She used her visual prowess to cast
that jutsu upon the populace.

1346
01:39:05,098 --> 01:39:07,392
It was a ghastly jutsu.

1347
01:39:08,422 --> 01:39:10,593
If all chakra were to
be reunited into one again,

1348
01:39:10,803 --> 01:39:13,723
a new Chakra Fruit
would take shape.

1349
01:39:13,911 --> 01:39:17,164
That must be prevented
at all costs...

1350
01:39:17,567 --> 01:39:19,277
or this world will end.

1351
01:39:21,305 --> 01:39:25,290
I would like you to stop Madara.

1352
01:39:26,661 --> 01:39:30,547
Unlike the previous reincarnates,
you tend to be a little bit of a fool.

1353
01:39:30,547 --> 01:39:34,677
But there may be potential
in your unpredictability.

1354
01:39:36,122 --> 01:39:39,615
Even long after you died,
you tried to protect the world...

1355
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:41,091
And even when
it's turned out like this,

1356
01:39:41,517 --> 01:39:44,436
you still have faith in us.
Thank you.

1357
01:39:44,864 --> 01:39:48,993
Don't thank me.
I don't deserve it.

1358
01:39:49,532 --> 01:39:54,871
If the current world desires Indra's,
or rather, my mother's way...

1359
01:39:55,048 --> 01:39:57,675
and if that's the natural flow...

1360
01:39:57,700 --> 01:40:01,996
then I'm the one who's selfishly
trying to go against it and stop it.

1361
01:40:02,913 --> 01:40:05,624
Even in terms of how
the Tailed Beasts are being used,

1362
01:40:05,666 --> 01:40:10,587
not for maintaining peace and balance,
but only as weapons...

1363
01:40:10,843 --> 01:40:14,055
Perhaps my way is naïve.

1364
01:40:14,425 --> 01:40:15,551
No!

1365
01:40:15,598 --> 01:40:17,622
You're not wrong, Gramps!

1366
01:40:17,909 --> 01:40:20,536
<i>You're absolutely right, old man!</i>

1367
01:40:24,125 --> 01:40:26,645
Oh, aren't you Gaara's?

1368
01:40:27,061 --> 01:40:28,598
Why are you inside of me?

1369
01:40:29,352 --> 01:40:30,937
<i>You see, Obito...</i>

1370
01:40:31,650 --> 01:40:32,651
Octopops!

1371
01:40:32,901 --> 01:40:37,072
<i>He extracted a portion of Shukaku's
and my chakra from Madara.</i>

1372
01:40:37,587 --> 01:40:42,842
<i>He knew exactly which Tailed Beast
powers you were lacking, that guy!</i>

1373
01:40:43,210 --> 01:40:44,378
Obito did that?

1374
01:40:44,403 --> 01:40:45,946
<i>A lot of things happened.</i>

1375
01:40:46,498 --> 01:40:48,959
<i>He even put me inside of you.</i>

1376
01:40:49,543 --> 01:40:54,673
<i>Now you've got the chakra of all
nine Tailed Beasts within you, Naruto!</i>

1377
01:40:54,923 --> 01:40:57,468
Even you?
The other half of Kurama?

1378
01:40:57,546 --> 01:41:01,925
<i>The promised time has
finally come, old man Six Paths!</i>

1379
01:41:02,598 --> 01:41:05,174
You're right, my dear Kurama...

1380
01:41:05,755 --> 01:41:07,561
Just as Gamamaru prophesied...

1381
01:41:07,603 --> 01:41:11,440
a blue-eyed youth who can name all
nine beasts and frolic among them.

1382
01:41:11,482 --> 01:41:14,008
Prophesied? You mean the prophecy
Giant Gramps Sage passed on

1383
01:41:14,033 --> 01:41:15,451
to the Pervy Sage?

1384
01:41:15,694 --> 01:41:17,988
Gamamaru is his real name?

1385
01:41:18,363 --> 01:41:21,533
You're pretty awesome because
you know that, Gramps!

1386
01:41:21,798 --> 01:41:23,452
<i>Hey, Naruto!</i>

1387
01:41:26,497 --> 01:41:30,417
You truly have the ability
to win others' cooperation.

1388
01:41:30,709 --> 01:41:33,212
You managed to summon my soul.

1389
01:41:33,253 --> 01:41:35,756
And accepted that Ashura has
reincarnated inside of you.

1390
01:41:44,681 --> 01:41:45,682
Shukaku.

1391
01:41:45,766 --> 01:41:46,934
Matatabi.

1392
01:41:47,059 --> 01:41:48,060
Isobu.

1393
01:41:48,288 --> 01:41:49,498
Son Goku.

1394
01:41:49,684 --> 01:41:50,685
Kokuo.

1395
01:41:50,906 --> 01:41:51,907
Saiken.

1396
01:41:52,228 --> 01:41:53,229
Chomei.

1397
01:41:53,511 --> 01:41:54,512
Gyuki.

1398
01:41:54,733 --> 01:41:55,776
Kurama.

1399
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:04,576
It seems the time has come for the
child of prophecy to change the world.

1400
01:42:07,746 --> 01:42:09,081
My dear Naruto...

1401
01:42:10,315 --> 01:42:12,025
What do you want to do?

1402
01:42:12,751 --> 01:42:15,212
What do you seek for
the aftermath of this war?

1403
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:18,799
I would like to hear
your honest thoughts and opinions.

1404
01:42:21,934 --> 01:42:25,854
Maybe I'm really like
this Ashura guy.

1405
01:42:26,181 --> 01:42:29,226
Only... unlike him,
I'm just a stupid kid

1406
01:42:29,268 --> 01:42:31,520
who doesn't know much
about a lot of things.

1407
01:42:32,521 --> 01:42:34,815
But, I do know what friends are.

1408
01:42:35,257 --> 01:42:36,929
And I want to protect them all.

1409
01:42:37,651 --> 01:42:38,694
That's it.

1410
01:42:40,988 --> 01:42:43,073
Is that your answer?

1411
01:42:44,032 --> 01:42:44,909
Yeah...

1412
01:42:45,682 --> 01:42:49,370
Long ago, I entrusted
everything to Ashura and

1413
01:42:49,395 --> 01:42:52,774
cast my attention away
from Indra.

1414
01:42:53,667 --> 01:42:55,919
That proved to be
the source of calamity.

1415
01:42:58,046 --> 01:42:59,631
Put out your dominant arm.

1416
01:43:01,119 --> 01:43:07,775
This time, I am also entrusting
my power to you, Indra's reincarnate.

1417
01:43:08,785 --> 01:43:12,144
From this point on,
Naruto and Sasuke...

1418
01:43:12,186 --> 01:43:15,481
What you both shall do,
and what shall transpire,

1419
01:43:15,506 --> 01:43:17,341
will be up to the two of you.

1420
01:43:20,512 --> 01:43:22,305
Naruto and I...

1421
01:43:22,912 --> 01:43:24,489
Sasuke and I...

1422
01:43:24,694 --> 01:43:26,717
... may not be real brothers,

1423
01:43:26,742 --> 01:43:28,619
but I really believe that
we can make peace.

1424
01:43:29,328 --> 01:43:31,705
Because we're pretty good friends.

1425
01:43:36,019 --> 01:43:36,959
Now then...

1426
01:43:58,831 --> 01:44:00,083
Hey, Kabuto!

1427
01:44:00,203 --> 01:44:02,873
Sasuke's... Sasuke's going
to be okay, right?

1428
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:06,917
Hey, say something, you—!

1429
01:44:09,651 --> 01:44:10,463
Obito!

1430
01:44:10,587 --> 01:44:12,923
Is Naruto all right?

1431
01:44:13,538 --> 01:44:17,167
Naruto the Jinchuriki will die if
his Tailed Beast is extracted...

1432
01:44:18,896 --> 01:44:20,731
But I put the Tailed Beast
back inside him.

1433
01:44:20,756 --> 01:44:22,507
He should be okay now.

1434
01:44:36,270 --> 01:44:37,271
Sasuke!

1435
01:44:37,896 --> 01:44:39,022
Naruto!

1436
01:44:44,119 --> 01:44:44,970
– Time to go.
– Time to go.

1437
01:44:48,145 --> 01:44:49,409
Guy-sensei!

1438
01:44:50,575 --> 01:44:52,577
Even that... didn't work...

1439
01:45:00,433 --> 01:45:02,487
<i>Sekizo... isn't enough!</i>

1440
01:45:04,798 --> 01:45:06,216
This is great!

1441
01:45:06,432 --> 01:45:08,258
Keep on dancing!

1442
01:45:12,306 --> 01:45:14,933
<i>All that's left... is Night Guy!</i>

1443
01:45:19,521 --> 01:45:21,648
That stance is not the Sekizo!

1444
01:45:21,690 --> 01:45:24,943
Don't tell me he has something
even greater!

1445
01:45:27,698 --> 01:45:28,546
<i>Guy!</i>

1446
01:45:31,283 --> 01:45:32,951
Come on, Dad, hurry!

1447
01:45:33,286 --> 01:45:34,370
There's no need to rush.

1448
01:45:34,536 --> 01:45:36,496
The Academy isn't going
to run away, is it?

1449
01:45:36,748 --> 01:45:39,668
There's a set time for
entrance applications.

1450
01:45:41,835 --> 01:45:43,628
Oh, nice to meet you!

1451
01:45:43,982 --> 01:45:46,985
My son will be attending
the Academy.

1452
01:45:47,195 --> 01:45:48,238
Dad...

1453
01:45:48,967 --> 01:45:50,635
I hope those two
will get along okay.

1454
01:45:51,094 --> 01:45:53,388
I'm afraid that will
be impossible!

1455
01:45:53,430 --> 01:45:55,015
Huh? What a thing to say!

1456
01:45:55,098 --> 01:45:57,642
Are you one of those overbearing parents?!

1457
01:45:57,667 --> 01:45:59,585
No, Dad... You're wrong.

1458
01:45:59,728 --> 01:46:03,023
He failed the Academy
entrance exam.

1459
01:46:04,207 --> 01:46:08,461
Oh, pardon me! I just assumed
since you were in front of the Academy.

1460
01:46:10,572 --> 01:46:12,324
Don't worry about it!

1461
01:46:12,436 --> 01:46:14,230
Uh, I don't think it's anything
to be laughing about.

1462
01:46:14,255 --> 01:46:16,340
Hey, Kakashi, don't be rude.

1463
01:46:16,521 --> 01:46:19,607
But Dad, you were a lot ruder
just a minute ago.

1464
01:46:20,290 --> 01:46:23,919
I mean, this guy is trying
to get into the Academy

1465
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:27,631
even though he can't
use ninjutsu.

1466
01:46:27,775 --> 01:46:30,903
Oops, we should get going,
or we're going to be late.

1467
01:46:31,788 --> 01:46:33,053
Right.

1468
01:46:34,532 --> 01:46:35,533
Excuse me.

1469
01:46:37,543 --> 01:46:38,980
Your name's Kakashi Hatake, right?

1470
01:46:41,978 --> 01:46:44,147
Thank you for your support!

1471
01:46:55,659 --> 01:46:56,743
Kakashi...

1472
01:46:57,560 --> 01:47:01,248
Don't slack off just because
you got into the Academy.

1473
01:47:02,525 --> 01:47:03,777
At the rate he's training,

1474
01:47:03,857 --> 01:47:05,526
that boy will become
stronger than you.

1475
01:47:06,461 --> 01:47:07,587
He will?

1476
01:47:09,297 --> 01:47:11,383
They haven't announced
the alternates yet, have they?

1477
01:47:11,716 --> 01:47:13,301
The Academy isn't dumb.

1478
01:47:13,998 --> 01:47:16,596
You should ask what his name is
and remember it.

1479
01:47:16,888 --> 01:47:18,265
What...?

1480
01:47:18,734 --> 01:47:20,143
He'll be a good rival for you.

1481
01:47:22,912 --> 01:47:24,020
Hey, you!

1482
01:47:26,189 --> 01:47:27,399
What's your name?

1483
01:47:32,920 --> 01:47:34,381
Might Guy!

1484
01:47:34,406 --> 01:47:36,908
I'm going to become stronger
than anyone around!

1485
01:47:42,456 --> 01:47:45,041
<i>Dad, it ended up exactly
as you predicted.</i>

1486
01:47:45,375 --> 01:47:46,308
<i>Guy!</i>

1487
01:47:53,307 --> 01:47:55,168
I'll acknowledge this chakra of yours!

1488
01:47:56,136 --> 01:47:58,602
Of all those who have
fought me over the years,

1489
01:47:58,627 --> 01:48:01,615
there's no one who surpasses you in taijutsu!

1490
01:48:02,392 --> 01:48:05,812
I, Madara, declare you the strongest!

1491
01:48:06,271 --> 01:48:07,055
<i>Flow!</i>

1492
01:48:15,033 --> 01:48:15,797
<i>He's fast!</i>

1493
01:48:17,115 --> 01:48:19,659
<i>What?!
He's bending space?</i>

1494
01:48:21,578 --> 01:48:22,615
<i>Night Guy!</i>

1495
01:48:58,173 --> 01:48:59,265
Guy-sensei?

1496
01:49:01,448 --> 01:49:03,447
<i>That was Guy's final move!</i>

1497
01:49:04,496 --> 01:49:05,447
<i>What happened?</i>

1498
01:49:24,683 --> 01:49:27,894
I almost died, you bastard!

1499
01:49:37,195 --> 01:49:39,573
Your flame is about to go out...

1500
01:49:39,598 --> 01:49:43,101
But as a parting gift for
such a great time,

1501
01:49:43,355 --> 01:49:44,932
I'll finish you off...

1502
01:49:45,866 --> 01:49:47,756
before you turn to ash on your own!

1503
01:49:55,652 --> 01:49:57,654
<i>He kicked away my Truth-Seeker Orb?!</i>

1504
01:49:58,810 --> 01:49:59,932
Bushier Brow-sensei...

1505
01:50:16,191 --> 01:50:17,444
Naruto...?

1506
01:50:18,153 --> 01:50:21,197
You seem a little different
from before.

1507
01:50:22,741 --> 01:50:24,618
<i>What did Obito do?</i>

1508
01:50:25,081 --> 01:50:25,856
Yeah...

1509
01:50:26,757 --> 01:50:29,051
I'm still trying to figure it out myself.

1510
01:50:30,665 --> 01:50:33,251
But I think I can change
everything now!

1511
01:50:36,463 --> 01:50:38,256
That node's chakra hasn't gone out.

1512
01:50:39,215 --> 01:50:41,801
<i>Don't tell me he stopped
the end result of the Eight Gates?!</i>

1513
01:50:55,652 --> 01:50:58,489
<i>He touched the Truth-Seeker Orb,
so how can he—?</i>

1514
01:50:59,548 --> 01:51:02,259
<i>Is it because
I haven't finished healing yet?</i>

1515
01:51:03,793 --> 01:51:04,574
<i>No!</i>

1516
01:51:05,238 --> 01:51:07,448
<i>His power is suddenly growing?!</i>

1517
01:51:08,179 --> 01:51:08,814
<i>Son!</i>

1518
01:51:09,037 --> 01:51:10,637
<i>Lend me some of your chakra, okay?</i>

1519
01:51:10,918 --> 01:51:11,919
<i>All right!</i>

1520
01:51:19,995 --> 01:51:23,248
<i>Sage Art: Lava Style Rasen Shuriken!</i>

1521
01:51:27,681 --> 01:51:28,848
Th-This is bad!

1522
01:51:29,442 --> 01:51:30,175
<i>Limbo!</i>

1523
01:51:32,977 --> 01:51:36,332
<i>What?! He dodged... my Limbo?!</i>

1524
01:51:40,673 --> 01:51:41,674
All right!

1525
01:51:45,340 --> 01:51:46,425
Burst!

1526
01:52:25,613 --> 01:52:28,408
<i>Take me within you.</i>

1527
01:52:29,468 --> 01:52:30,469
<i>Who is that?!</i>

1528
01:52:32,537 --> 01:52:34,080
<i>Take the Divine Tree...</i>

1529
01:52:35,717 --> 01:52:36,885
<i>Ten-Tails...</i>

1530
01:52:38,752 --> 01:52:42,380
<i>... everything, into you.</i>

1531
01:53:04,944 --> 01:53:06,321
The tree disappeared!

1532
01:53:09,306 --> 01:53:10,307
Guy-sensei!

1533
01:53:11,738 --> 01:53:13,406
Bushier Brow-sensei
is going to be okay!

1534
01:53:14,204 --> 01:53:16,039
He's not going to die!

1535
01:53:16,498 --> 01:53:18,333
Naruto, you healed him?

1536
01:53:18,958 --> 01:53:21,711
But I thought he had activated
all Eight Gates...

1537
01:53:22,730 --> 01:53:25,608
I feel like I can
do all sorts of things...

1538
01:53:26,174 --> 01:53:27,634
the way I am right now!

1539
01:53:34,965 --> 01:53:37,802
<i>He touched Madara's rods,
but he wasn't affected...</i>

1540
01:53:41,089 --> 01:53:44,843
<i>What happened to him
while he was dying?</i>

1541
01:53:46,296 --> 01:53:48,716
Can you teleport, Lord Second?

1542
01:53:50,873 --> 01:53:52,249
I see...

1543
01:53:53,144 --> 01:53:57,023
Yeah... Since I'm linked to
the Fourth's markings.

1544
01:53:57,886 --> 01:53:58,887
But unfortunately...

1545
01:53:59,463 --> 01:54:02,758
At my current strength,
I can only teleport one person.

1546
01:54:03,001 --> 01:54:04,002
That's plenty.

1547
01:54:04,879 --> 01:54:06,673
I alone need to go.

1548
01:54:07,423 --> 01:54:10,176
Bushy Brow and Gaara,
take care of Bushier Brow-sensei.

1549
01:54:11,344 --> 01:54:12,345
Naruto...

1550
01:54:13,513 --> 01:54:16,474
Thank you for... Guy-sensei...

1551
01:54:18,351 --> 01:54:19,352
Naruto...

1552
01:54:23,314 --> 01:54:28,152
When you become Hokage,
let's have a drink together.

1553
01:54:29,487 --> 01:54:30,488
You got it!

1554
01:54:37,453 --> 01:54:38,601
Is that Naruto?!

1555
01:54:39,007 --> 01:54:40,008
<i>Obito...</i>

1556
01:54:40,790 --> 01:54:41,791
<i>You...</i>

1557
01:54:42,765 --> 01:54:43,975
You're an enemy.

1558
01:54:45,169 --> 01:54:47,964
You hurt and killed
many of my comrades...

1559
01:54:49,173 --> 01:54:52,135
I don't want to say this, but...

1560
01:54:52,812 --> 01:54:56,149
I'm going to consider you
an ally just this once.

1561
01:55:00,602 --> 01:55:03,354
Thank you for saving Naruto.

1562
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:07,025
I have one final favor to ask you.

1563
01:55:08,234 --> 01:55:12,113
Not as an ally, but as an enemy...

1564
01:55:18,622 --> 01:55:19,790
<i>I understand now...</i>

1565
01:55:20,746 --> 01:55:22,748
<i>The Divine Tree itself...</i>

1566
01:55:28,823 --> 01:55:31,909
<i>The time has come
for all to become one.</i>

1567
01:55:38,843 --> 01:55:40,970
<i>Is it because
I met the Sage Gramps</i>

1568
01:55:40,995 --> 01:55:42,872
<i>and got more power from him?</i>

1569
01:55:43,729 --> 01:55:45,981
<i>I can feel it clearly even
from here...</i>

1570
01:55:46,486 --> 01:55:49,113
<i>The other half of
Gramps' power.</i>

1571
01:55:49,882 --> 01:55:51,967
You cannot take me down.

1572
01:55:52,528 --> 01:55:55,073
Essentially, I am completely immortal now.

1573
01:55:56,047 --> 01:55:57,924
I have obtained eternity!

1574
01:55:58,985 --> 01:56:00,111
You idiot!

1575
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:02,187
I'm not taking you down...

1576
01:56:07,835 --> 01:56:10,171
We're going to take you down!

1577
01:56:12,011 --> 01:56:14,680
Your time has come, Madara.

1578
01:56:18,122 --> 01:56:20,611
<i>One has awakened
the Six Paths' Senjutsu...</i>

1579
01:56:21,103 --> 01:56:23,818
<i>and the other awakened
the Rinnegan, huh?</i>

1580
01:56:24,644 --> 01:56:30,358
However... I possess
both of those powers!

1581
01:56:32,735 --> 01:56:34,575
This is the final battle!

1582
01:56:36,364 --> 01:56:39,242
My powers versus yours...

1583
01:56:40,157 --> 01:56:43,369
Let's settle who is superior,
once and for all!

1584
01:56:46,958 --> 01:56:49,837
<i>Sage Art:
Yin Style Thunder Blast!</i>

1585
01:56:59,785 --> 01:57:01,037
<i>Sasuke's gone?!</i>

1586
01:57:09,866 --> 01:57:11,315
<i>This left eye...</i>

1587
01:57:11,962 --> 01:57:13,111
<i>So that's what it can do...</i>

1588
01:57:13,906 --> 01:57:16,303
<i>Teleportation? This distance...?</i>

1589
01:57:16,985 --> 01:57:19,904
<i>No, he didn't teleport!</i>

1590
01:57:23,245 --> 01:57:25,247
<i>You should pay attention!</i>

1591
01:57:25,496 --> 01:57:26,291
<i>Limbo!</i>

1592
01:57:28,592 --> 01:57:29,667
<i>What is that?!</i>

1593
01:57:33,977 --> 01:57:34,915
<i>He did it again!</i>

1594
01:57:36,257 --> 01:57:37,326
<i>Sage Art:</i>

1595
01:57:38,634 --> 01:57:40,887
<i>Storm Style Fang of Light!</i>

1596
01:57:44,713 --> 01:57:45,837
<i>It's coming again!</i>

1597
01:57:46,277 --> 01:57:47,393
<i>Over there!</i>

1598
01:57:50,563 --> 01:57:51,814
<i>It didn't hit.</i>

1599
01:57:58,814 --> 01:58:00,490
Sasuke, it's headed your way!

1600
01:58:00,788 --> 01:58:03,201
Something I can't see is
lurking around you.

1601
01:58:03,226 --> 01:58:05,771
Oh yeah? I can see it clearly!

1602
01:58:06,477 --> 01:58:09,814
<i>These guys can see my Limbo...</i>

1603
01:58:12,732 --> 01:58:15,755
<i>It's... another Madara.</i>

1604
01:58:20,438 --> 01:58:23,316
<i>So he can see it with his Rinnegan...</i>

1605
01:58:24,242 --> 01:58:28,985
<i>And that one,
can't see it but senses it...</i>

1606
01:58:29,399 --> 01:58:30,249
Naruto!

1607
01:58:31,270 --> 01:58:33,564
Looks like our physical attacks...

1608
01:58:33,815 --> 01:58:37,110
have no effect on
the other Madara.

1609
01:58:37,401 --> 01:58:38,224
Yeah!

1610
01:58:41,295 --> 01:58:46,675
<i>Normally, one shouldn't be able to
sense or see it from this realm...</i>

1611
01:58:47,669 --> 01:58:51,582
<i>That "me" exists in
the invisible world of "Limbo."</i>

1612
01:58:52,375 --> 01:58:56,003
<i>How did they both obtain
such power so suddenly?</i>

1613
01:58:58,850 --> 01:59:00,582
<i>That Sasuke Uchiha...</i>

1614
01:59:00,909 --> 01:59:03,891
<i>He was the only one who
awakened the straight pattern,</i>

1615
01:59:03,916 --> 01:59:05,454
<i>Choku-Tomoe Sharingan
just like mine.</i>

1616
01:59:06,024 --> 01:59:10,820
<i>Perhaps Sasuke and I share
a bond that goes beyond blood.</i>

1617
01:59:12,040 --> 01:59:13,124
Well then...

1618
01:59:13,463 --> 01:59:17,050
That left eye should suit me perfectly!

1619
01:59:31,289 --> 01:59:35,293
So, that's your left eye's
ability as well.

1620
01:59:39,449 --> 01:59:42,076
Then try it.

1621
01:59:43,634 --> 01:59:45,928
That's not enough to kill you, is it?

1622
01:59:47,629 --> 01:59:53,019
<i>So the Six Paths' Sage chakra can
affect the shadow Madara too, huh?</i>

1623
01:59:55,731 --> 01:59:57,772
<i>That wound on his right arm...</i>

1624
01:59:58,798 --> 02:00:02,278
<i>is from blocking
Naruto's first attack earlier.</i>

1625
02:00:09,565 --> 02:00:13,581
It seems your shadow returns to
your body after a certain amount of time.

1626
02:00:14,165 --> 02:00:19,086
Naruto, when his shadow
emerges again, go after it.

1627
02:00:19,712 --> 02:00:22,215
I'll take on the visible one. However...

1628
02:00:23,522 --> 02:00:26,152
I used to hate it when
you would order me around...

1629
02:00:26,177 --> 02:00:28,095
Some things never change, huh?

1630
02:00:28,304 --> 02:00:30,306
Let me finish.

1631
02:00:31,368 --> 02:00:33,746
This is our chance.

1632
02:00:35,017 --> 02:00:39,396
Madara and his shadow will probably
stay merged for a little while longer.

1633
02:00:39,990 --> 02:00:41,325
I don't care what it is,

1634
02:00:41,350 --> 02:00:44,270
but get a Sage Power Jutsu ready.

1635
02:00:44,823 --> 02:00:46,450
One that seals movement.

1636
02:00:48,132 --> 02:00:53,095
<i>Then you should use my chakra
to build your Sealing Jutsu.</i>

1637
02:00:53,120 --> 02:00:55,289
Thanks... ummm...

1638
02:00:55,331 --> 02:00:56,332
<i>It's Shukaku!</i>

1639
02:00:58,584 --> 02:01:01,754
<i>He's estimating the Limbo's duration,</i>

1640
02:01:02,113 --> 02:01:05,513
<i>activation interval
and how to counter it...</i>

1641
02:01:06,103 --> 02:01:07,843
<i>He's got a sharp intuition,</i>

1642
02:01:08,056 --> 02:01:10,589
<i>calm analyzing and
judgment skills,</i>

1643
02:01:11,151 --> 02:01:13,519
<i>and a Choku-Tomoe Sharingan
just like mine.</i>

1644
02:01:14,052 --> 02:01:16,519
<i>If he had only been born
before Obito...</i>

1645
02:01:17,243 --> 02:01:18,854
<i>he would be my...</i>

1646
02:01:20,436 --> 02:01:23,413
<i>No... There's no point
in reflecting now.</i>

1647
02:01:23,985 --> 02:01:25,413
<i>No matter what's happened,</i>

1648
02:01:25,438 --> 02:01:29,413
<i>I must keep in mind that
these two aren't ordinary brats.</i>

1649
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:33,481
<i>I need to get
my other eye back soon.</i>

1650
02:01:34,498 --> 02:01:37,331
<i>Sage Art: Magnet Style Rasengan!</i>

1651
02:01:39,571 --> 02:01:41,460
And I have Six Paths Power too...

1652
02:01:42,279 --> 02:01:43,049
<i>Chidori!</i>

1653
02:01:45,013 --> 02:01:47,191
Naruto, shoot that towards me!

1654
02:01:47,580 --> 02:01:48,634
I'll take care of the rest.

1655
02:01:48,676 --> 02:01:52,138
It's a bit irritating,
but there's no time to argue!

1656
02:02:02,940 --> 02:02:04,984
<i>Why am I here?</i>

1657
02:02:21,126 --> 02:02:23,958
Naruto, the jutsu the Sage of
Six Paths gave you...

1658
02:02:24,112 --> 02:02:25,242
You know it, right?

1659
02:02:25,588 --> 02:02:27,474
Yeah, the time is now!

1660
02:02:28,886 --> 02:02:29,702
What?

1661
02:02:30,059 --> 02:02:30,950
He moved?

1662
02:02:34,515 --> 02:02:36,312
<i>He substituted his shadow?</i>

1663
02:02:38,289 --> 02:02:39,108
Over there!

1664
02:02:41,764 --> 02:02:45,310
Sasuke, I'll hold this one down,
so go after the real one!

1665
02:02:51,117 --> 02:02:55,080
<i>Seems like his Rinnegan
can't reach this distance.</i>

1666
02:02:55,738 --> 02:03:00,326
<i>I'm starting to understand
your left eye's abilities, Sasuke.</i>

1667
02:03:02,416 --> 02:03:03,709
Hurry, Sasuke!

1668
02:03:04,382 --> 02:03:05,780
Madara is heading straight for...

1669
02:03:08,839 --> 02:03:10,132
Kakashi-sensei!

1670
02:03:31,021 --> 02:03:33,190
Hurry and destroy my Rinnegan...

1671
02:03:34,363 --> 02:03:36,951
I can't hold off Black Zetsu any longer.

1672
02:03:39,772 --> 02:03:42,218
<i>I must admit Sasuke sure is fast.</i>

1673
02:03:49,981 --> 02:03:50,600
<i>Kamui!</i>

1674
02:03:53,723 --> 02:03:54,437
<i>Damn!</i>

1675
02:03:54,802 --> 02:03:56,345
<i>Just his upper body, huh?</i>

1676
02:03:58,138 --> 02:03:58,999
Hurry!

1677
02:04:00,388 --> 02:04:01,322
I know!

1678
02:04:06,605 --> 02:04:07,982
Oh no, you don't!

1679
02:04:10,401 --> 02:04:11,150
<i>Kamui!</i>

1680
02:04:16,293 --> 02:04:17,124
Sakura!

1681
02:04:19,660 --> 02:04:20,744
Kakashi-sensei.

1682
02:04:22,450 --> 02:04:23,576
Sasuke?!

1683
02:04:23,984 --> 02:04:26,181
Why did you pop up here, Sakura?

1684
02:04:26,876 --> 02:04:28,562
She was in the Time-Space dimension...

1685
02:04:29,253 --> 02:04:31,380
Sakura, what's going on
over there?

1686
02:04:32,381 --> 02:04:34,300
Kakashi-sensei, your left eye!

1687
02:04:36,450 --> 02:04:37,701
It all happened so quickly.

1688
02:04:38,530 --> 02:04:41,390
But I think Madara stole my Sharingan.

1689
02:04:42,266 --> 02:04:43,491
Let me take a look, Sensei!

1690
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:44,757
Thanks.

1691
02:04:45,956 --> 02:04:47,708
In any case, what happened to Obito?

1692
02:04:48,772 --> 02:04:51,317
I'm sure Madara used the Kamui
to teleport himself there!

1693
02:04:52,384 --> 02:04:54,302
In a flash,
I was back out here, so...

1694
02:04:56,363 --> 02:04:57,570
What's wrong, Sakura?!

1695
02:04:58,510 --> 02:05:00,117
We're in trouble!

1696
02:05:00,618 --> 02:05:03,120
Obito had reached his limit
and couldn't move...

1697
02:05:03,382 --> 02:05:06,719
Which means Madara's going
to get Obito's Rinnegan!

1698
02:05:11,879 --> 02:05:15,633
The Cursed Seal Tag I placed on
your heart has disappeared.

1699
02:05:16,174 --> 02:05:17,610
How did you remove it?

1700
02:05:17,635 --> 02:05:21,013
You shouldn't have been able
to damage it yourself.

1701
02:05:21,972 --> 02:05:24,808
I had Kakashi stab me
and remove it.

1702
02:05:25,976 --> 02:05:28,020
<i>This is all I can do right now.</i>

1703
02:05:33,067 --> 02:05:36,176
Since it was in the way
of me making myself

1704
02:05:36,671 --> 02:05:38,656
into the Ten-Tails' Jinchuriki...

1705
02:05:39,573 --> 02:05:42,117
I gambled my life on it...

1706
02:05:42,284 --> 02:05:45,329
But I wasn't going to keep
doing what you wanted!

1707
02:05:47,191 --> 02:05:50,609
Actually, you did exactly
what I wanted you to do.

1708
02:05:51,095 --> 02:05:53,181
In fact, you exceeded my hopes.

1709
02:05:54,630 --> 02:05:56,674
What's so funny?

1710
02:05:57,301 --> 02:05:59,763
A Curse Seal Tag meant to
turn you into a puppet...

1711
02:06:00,487 --> 02:06:04,098
One that would restrict your movements,

1712
02:06:04,364 --> 02:06:07,046
should you try to remove it from
inside the body it's implanted in.

1713
02:06:07,434 --> 02:06:09,756
It seems you knew about it, Obito.

1714
02:06:10,980 --> 02:06:13,941
Regarding these Cursed Tags
I implanted in the two of you...

1715
02:06:14,146 --> 02:06:16,714
Naturally, you couldn't have
killed yourselves either.

1716
02:06:17,115 --> 02:06:19,992
Since you both were
my precious pawns.

1717
02:06:20,892 --> 02:06:22,978
"You both" ...?

1718
02:06:23,452 --> 02:06:25,261
As fate would have it...

1719
02:06:25,286 --> 02:06:27,621
It's ironic that both of
you ended up

1720
02:06:27,663 --> 02:06:29,873
getting rid of them through
the exact same method.

1721
02:06:36,565 --> 02:06:37,290
<i>Rin!</i>

1722
02:06:37,516 --> 02:06:38,392
Yes.

1723
02:06:38,799 --> 02:06:41,468
That plot to make that girl
into the Three-Tails' Jinchuriki

1724
02:06:41,493 --> 02:06:45,155
and have her rampage through
the Leaf Village was mine.

1725
02:06:45,180 --> 02:06:47,057
Not the Hidden Mist's!

1726
02:06:47,403 --> 02:06:50,355
That girl took advantage of
Kakashi's attack against the enemy

1727
02:06:50,380 --> 02:06:52,191
to avert the plot,
at the cost of her life.

1728
02:06:52,216 --> 02:06:54,093
But that was also part
of my plan...

1729
02:06:54,754 --> 02:06:58,588
In order to plunge you into darkness
and make you into my pawn.

1730
02:06:59,124 --> 02:07:02,544
You bastard, you deliberately
had me see all that!

1731
02:07:03,565 --> 02:07:06,255
I waited for the opportunity,

1732
02:07:06,900 --> 02:07:09,830
when Minato was away
on another mission.

1733
02:07:09,872 --> 02:07:12,041
And manipulated the Mist shinobi
into kidnapping Rin,

1734
02:07:12,082 --> 02:07:14,126
leaving Kakashi
so he would come after her.

1735
02:07:14,476 --> 02:07:16,581
The other purpose of that

1736
02:07:16,606 --> 02:07:18,900
was so I could see the extent
of your unleashed power.

1737
02:07:19,506 --> 02:07:21,590
Did you really think that
White Zetsu goading you on,

1738
02:07:21,615 --> 02:07:24,367
and you being able to get out
from underground right at that moment

1739
02:07:24,503 --> 02:07:27,061
was all a big coincidence?

1740
02:07:29,808 --> 02:07:34,421
Either way, I would have had
my Puppet Shinobi kill her.

1741
02:07:34,855 --> 02:07:38,275
I taught you to use the darkness
in people's hearts...

1742
02:07:38,317 --> 02:07:40,486
to manipulate them, didn't I, Obito?

1743
02:07:43,364 --> 02:07:45,824
If there isn't any darkness,
you can create some.

1744
02:07:45,824 --> 02:07:50,204
Don't you think it's presumptuous
to consider yourself any different?

1745
02:07:51,603 --> 02:07:54,673
Why? Why me?!

1746
02:07:54,918 --> 02:07:59,464
You were kind and cared about
people from the bottom of your heart.

1747
02:08:00,047 --> 02:08:02,341
Remember how great you were
at taking care of the elderly?

1748
02:08:05,052 --> 02:08:07,888
Your deep love for Rin...
for your comrades and friends...

1749
02:08:07,930 --> 02:08:11,392
for the Hokage and
all other shinobi...

1750
02:08:12,559 --> 02:08:16,067
Once you fell into darkness,
it would conversely transform

1751
02:08:16,092 --> 02:08:18,636
into an equally profound
hatred for this world.

1752
02:08:18,975 --> 02:08:20,980
That's the kind of guy you are.

1753
02:08:22,577 --> 02:08:25,472
I'll be taking back that left eye.

1754
02:08:33,288 --> 02:08:34,456
This should do it!

1755
02:08:34,498 --> 02:08:35,916
You can't move anymore.

1756
02:08:36,143 --> 02:08:37,603
I'm leaving him to you!

1757
02:08:37,628 --> 02:08:39,713
Right! You can count on me!

1758
02:08:40,159 --> 02:08:43,841
We don't know when Madara
might emerge. Stay alert.

1759
02:08:47,080 --> 02:08:48,762
What about his shadow?

1760
02:08:48,843 --> 02:08:50,678
I stopped him cold with

1761
02:08:50,758 --> 02:08:52,009
my Shadow Clones and
Six Paths' Rods!

1762
02:08:52,199 --> 02:08:53,075
Naruto?

1763
02:08:53,203 --> 02:08:54,322
Hey, Sakura...

1764
02:08:54,729 --> 02:08:55,814
Let me do it!

1765
02:08:56,871 --> 02:08:58,664
What are you trying to do, Naruto?

1766
02:08:58,906 --> 02:08:59,674
Hey!

1767
02:08:59,932 --> 02:09:01,308
It's okay, it's okay.

1768
02:09:09,950 --> 02:09:12,453
Kakashi-sensei,
try opening your eye.

1769
02:09:17,875 --> 02:09:20,002
No way! How did you do that?

1770
02:09:20,836 --> 02:09:23,881
It's really hard to explain in words...

1771
02:09:23,985 --> 02:09:27,033
But I took a part of Kakashi-sensei,

1772
02:09:27,058 --> 02:09:29,408
and then I kinda... um... uhh...

1773
02:09:29,433 --> 02:09:31,894
Hey, Naruto...
I told everyone to stay alert!

1774
02:09:32,222 --> 02:09:33,223
What?

1775
02:09:33,427 --> 02:09:35,632
But it's the first time
I'm hearing of it!

1776
02:09:35,715 --> 02:09:38,985
Quit talking back
for once, Naruto!

1777
02:09:39,357 --> 02:09:41,576
Anyway, you'll have to explain
about the eye later!

1778
02:09:41,857 --> 02:09:44,860
Madara stole Kakashi's eye
and went to where Obito is.

1779
02:09:45,422 --> 02:09:47,713
The next time he appears,
he'll have both Rinnegan!

1780
02:09:47,966 --> 02:09:49,467
What? Really?

1781
02:09:53,994 --> 02:09:57,706
<i>Let's see, we'll start
with the introductions.</i>

1782
02:09:58,015 --> 02:09:59,683
<i>I'll go! I'll go!</i>

1783
02:09:59,708 --> 02:10:01,460
<i>I'm Naruto Uzumaki!</i>

1784
02:10:01,542 --> 02:10:03,335
<i>I love instant cup ramen.</i>

1785
02:10:03,879 --> 02:10:06,673
<i>But I really love
the ramen at Ichiraku</i>

1786
02:10:06,715 --> 02:10:08,592
<i>that Iruka-sensei treats me to
even more!</i>

1787
02:10:09,343 --> 02:10:11,178
<i>I hate having to
wait three minutes</i>

1788
02:10:11,220 --> 02:10:12,930
<i>after pouring the hot water
into the cup.</i>

1789
02:10:13,340 --> 02:10:15,015
<i>My future dream is...</i>

1790
02:10:15,891 --> 02:10:17,267
<i>to surpass the Hokage!</i>

1791
02:10:17,351 --> 02:10:19,937
<i>And that's why I'm going to
make everyone in the village...</i>

1792
02:10:20,139 --> 02:10:22,199
<i>acknowledge me!</i>

1793
02:10:23,023 --> 02:10:24,733
<i>My name is Sasuke Uchiha.</i>

1794
02:10:25,899 --> 02:10:29,319
<i>There are lots of things I hate.
And not many things I like.</i>

1795
02:10:30,739 --> 02:10:34,701
<i>Also... I have no intention of
saying I have a dream,</i>

1796
02:10:34,743 --> 02:10:35,786
<i>but I do have an ambition.</i>

1797
02:10:38,059 --> 02:10:39,894
<i>That is...</i>

1798
02:10:41,764 --> 02:10:43,099
<i>to kill a certain man one day.</i>

1799
02:10:43,585 --> 02:10:45,170
<i>I'm Sakura Haruno.</i>

1800
02:10:45,759 --> 02:10:50,795
<i>What I like... I mean,
who I like is... um...</i>

1801
02:10:51,627 --> 02:10:53,759
<i>My future dream is...</i>

1802
02:11:00,227 --> 02:11:03,480
<i>You've already surpassed
the Hokage, Naruto.</i>

1803
02:11:04,418 --> 02:11:07,818
<i>You're a hero and
everyone has acknowledged you.</i>

1804
02:11:07,946 --> 02:11:09,697
<i>But becoming Hokage
is still your dream.</i>

1805
02:11:10,636 --> 02:11:11,989
<i>And Sakura...</i>

1806
02:11:12,281 --> 02:11:13,782
<i>I bet your feelings for Sasuke</i>

1807
02:11:13,824 --> 02:11:15,367
<i>have changed from
what they were back then.</i>

1808
02:11:15,605 --> 02:11:18,566
<i>You still love him,
but on a totally different level.</i>

1809
02:11:19,663 --> 02:11:22,291
<i>He tried to kill you,
yet you still care for him.</i>

1810
02:11:22,916 --> 02:11:26,211
<i>You won't cut him off,
no matter what.</i>

1811
02:11:26,754 --> 02:11:29,365
<i>And you think it's your duty
to save him from the darkness.</i>

1812
02:11:30,215 --> 02:11:32,092
<i>That's how kind you are.</i>

1813
02:11:33,343 --> 02:11:34,344
<i>Sasuke...</i>

1814
02:11:34,845 --> 02:11:37,264
<i>Your dream was to kill Itachi.</i>

1815
02:11:37,764 --> 02:11:41,184
<i>Now that he's gone,
what do you desire?</i>

1816
02:11:41,184 --> 02:11:42,895
<i>What are you heading towards?</i>

1817
02:11:43,984 --> 02:11:45,944
<i>I was your teacher,</i>

1818
02:11:46,148 --> 02:11:48,609
<i>but it turned out that
I didn't understand you at all.</i>

1819
02:11:49,067 --> 02:11:50,861
<i>Even now...</i>

1820
02:11:51,778 --> 02:11:52,634
Sasuke...

1821
02:11:53,071 --> 02:11:54,656
What is your dream now?

1822
02:12:00,307 --> 02:12:03,041
It might be fate

1823
02:12:03,375 --> 02:12:06,418
that reunited the old
Team 7 like this, Sasuke.

1824
02:12:07,210 --> 02:12:12,466
If you don't want to say what
you're thinking right now, that's fine.

1825
02:12:12,801 --> 02:12:17,889
But the fact that we were
once Team 7 is indisputable...

1826
02:12:18,680 --> 02:12:19,806
Right?

1827
02:12:22,446 --> 02:12:24,135
In front! He's coming!

1828
02:12:24,895 --> 02:12:26,210
You haven't forgotten the lesson

1829
02:12:26,235 --> 02:12:28,237
from the very first mission
to steal the bells, have you?

1830
02:12:28,357 --> 02:12:29,203
Yes!

1831
02:12:30,393 --> 02:12:31,728
Of course not!

1832
02:12:32,120 --> 02:12:33,330
The answer is teamwork!

1833
02:12:50,659 --> 02:12:57,583
Then dying together can also
be considered teamwork, eh?

1834
02:13:01,890 --> 02:13:05,060
Madara... you have both Rinnegan.

1835
02:13:06,186 --> 02:13:08,897
<i>His lower body has
completely healed.</i>

1836
02:13:12,534 --> 02:13:13,392
Obito!

1837
02:13:14,112 --> 02:13:18,617
<i>Unfortunately, Obito is gone.</i>

1838
02:13:18,782 --> 02:13:21,410
<i>I've taken over his body now.</i>

1839
02:13:22,119 --> 02:13:27,457
<i>Seems he was hoping
to right his wrongs.</i>

1840
02:13:28,595 --> 02:13:31,962
<i>He was praying like
a child, deep inside...</i>

1841
02:13:32,004 --> 02:13:36,133
<i>so that he could leave
the future to you all.</i>

1842
02:13:36,657 --> 02:13:39,261
<i>How convenient that would
have been for him, right?</i>

1843
02:13:39,302 --> 02:13:41,930
<i>Just like a spoiled brat.</i>

1844
02:13:57,356 --> 02:13:58,515
<i>I can't blame her.</i>

1845
02:14:00,323 --> 02:14:01,825
<i>Given the power of those eyes.</i>

1846
02:14:08,957 --> 02:14:11,710
<i>I'm not retreating anymore.</i>

1847
02:14:13,143 --> 02:14:15,479
I'll be the diversion.
So follow me!

1848
02:14:15,881 --> 02:14:16,765
Wait!

1849
02:14:20,982 --> 02:14:21,980
<i>Sakura!</i>

1850
02:14:27,851 --> 02:14:30,645
<i>The same Mitotic Regeneration Jutsu</i>

1851
02:14:30,687 --> 02:14:32,731
<i>as Hashirama's granddaughter.</i>

1852
02:14:34,941 --> 02:14:35,942
What?!

1853
02:14:36,651 --> 02:14:39,821
<i>An invisible wall?!
I can't reach him!</i>

1854
02:14:47,454 --> 02:14:48,580
<i>What's happening?!</i>

1855
02:14:53,668 --> 02:14:54,795
Sakura...

1856
02:14:55,545 --> 02:14:57,422
Don't worry about me, Naruto.

1857
02:14:58,799 --> 02:15:00,180
I'm all right, so...

1858
02:15:01,289 --> 02:15:02,094
Naruto!

1859
02:15:02,790 --> 02:15:05,690
Yeah, I know!
There are more of them, right?

1860
02:15:06,201 --> 02:15:08,842
That left eye is a Rinnegan!

1861
02:15:15,565 --> 02:15:18,527
<i>Madara's got four shadows now.</i>

1862
02:15:24,032 --> 02:15:25,951
Enough with this sideshow.

1863
02:15:41,341 --> 02:15:42,968
<i>What is he up to?</i>

1864
02:15:45,692 --> 02:15:47,501
<i>Planetary Devastation!</i>

1865
02:15:59,484 --> 02:16:01,486
Retreat for the time being!

1866
02:16:01,528 --> 02:16:02,904
What about Naruto and the others?!

1867
02:16:03,363 --> 02:16:05,907
They will pull through,
no matter what!

1868
02:16:24,375 --> 02:16:27,262
This is Six Paths' power?

1869
02:16:27,304 --> 02:16:30,098
He's way bigger than before
and there's more of 'em...

1870
02:16:30,410 --> 02:16:32,517
Stop getting distracted
by what's above!

1871
02:16:32,559 --> 02:16:34,686
His shadows are
on the ground with us!

1872
02:16:38,226 --> 02:16:41,764
They're a bit more solid and
larger than raindrops, but...

1873
02:16:44,905 --> 02:16:45,864
Here they come!

1874
02:16:46,069 --> 02:16:47,340
The shadows as well!

1875
02:16:47,365 --> 02:16:48,761
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

1876
02:16:50,262 --> 02:16:51,828
Leave them to me!

1877
02:17:02,422 --> 02:17:06,843
<i>I guess I'll just record
their final moments!</i>

1878
02:17:09,429 --> 02:17:10,430
Kurama...

1879
02:17:10,805 --> 02:17:11,932
<i>Yeah!</i>

1880
02:17:14,684 --> 02:17:15,734
<i>Susano'o!</i>

1881
02:17:16,217 --> 02:17:19,022
<i>Tailed Beast Bomb Rasen Shuriken!</i>

1882
02:17:46,800 --> 02:17:49,261
<i>Damn it!
There's no end to them!</i>

1883
02:17:50,887 --> 02:17:51,972
<i>Unbelievable...</i>

1884
02:17:52,097 --> 02:17:53,640
Damn you!

1885
02:18:08,871 --> 02:18:11,491
<i>According to that stone tablet.</i>

1886
02:18:11,533 --> 02:18:13,994
<i>When the one who possesses
the power of the Rinne,</i>

1887
02:18:14,035 --> 02:18:15,787
<i>should draw near the moon...</i>

1888
02:18:16,232 --> 02:18:18,974
<i>the eye that can reflect off
of the moon,</i>

1889
02:18:18,999 --> 02:18:21,919
<i>and grant the infinite dream,
shall open.</i>

1890
02:18:27,924 --> 02:18:32,262
Shine upon the world...
Infinite Tsukuyomi.

1891
02:18:34,556 --> 02:18:35,765
Wha—?!

1892
02:18:45,191 --> 02:18:46,318
What is this?

1893
02:18:48,069 --> 02:18:50,405
It's finally started...

1894
02:18:51,183 --> 02:18:52,893
I'm done with this!

1895
02:18:54,492 --> 02:18:57,749
Then we don't need these vessels
anymore either.

1896
02:18:59,714 --> 02:19:00,715
Again?!

1897
02:19:02,526 --> 02:19:04,111
What's all this shaking?

1898
02:19:04,210 --> 02:19:06,129
Over at 4 o'clock! Meteorites!

1899
02:19:07,881 --> 02:19:09,507
There are so many!

1900
02:19:09,883 --> 02:19:11,242
Brace for impact!

1901
02:19:13,928 --> 02:19:16,723
What's happening over there?!

1902
02:19:16,748 --> 02:19:18,124
That's not normal!

1903
02:19:20,393 --> 02:19:23,146
Something big is happening
over there, that's for sure.

1904
02:19:23,813 --> 02:19:26,775
Most likely, it's something bad.

1905
02:19:28,234 --> 02:19:29,277
What's the matter, Kiba?!

1906
02:19:29,903 --> 02:19:30,911
Shino...

1907
02:19:30,936 --> 02:19:32,938
The moon! Look at the moon!

1908
02:19:34,991 --> 02:19:37,202
This can't be!

1909
02:19:37,401 --> 02:19:38,986
What is happening?

1910
02:19:45,902 --> 02:19:47,946
<i>This is really bad.</i>

1911
02:19:56,596 --> 02:20:00,350
I'll pulverize all the meteorites
with these next, so don't worry.

1912
02:20:01,226 --> 02:20:03,311
You two stick close to me
and stay still!

1913
02:20:03,353 --> 02:20:04,354
Okay!

1914
02:20:04,937 --> 02:20:06,773
<i>I have to make sure
I don't hit Sasuke!</i>

1915
02:20:07,983 --> 02:20:08,698
Go!

1916
02:20:24,287 --> 02:20:26,184
Sasuke, don't head down here
so suddenly!

1917
02:20:26,209 --> 02:20:28,128
I could've hit you with
a Rasen Shuriken—!

1918
02:20:32,340 --> 02:20:35,093
Hey! Land more softly too!

1919
02:20:35,260 --> 02:20:37,220
Just shut up and stay still!

1920
02:20:47,625 --> 02:20:49,878
Now! Become one!

1921
02:21:24,809 --> 02:21:25,894
Those eyes...

1922
02:21:26,728 --> 02:21:28,771
Don't tell me Madara's launched
his jutsu already!

1923
02:21:58,636 --> 02:22:01,680
This light can penetrate and
see through even shadows...

1924
02:22:02,195 --> 02:22:03,864
No one can hide from it.

1925
02:22:04,349 --> 02:22:05,558
And now...

1926
02:22:07,267 --> 02:22:10,036
<i>Divine Deep Forest Emergence!</i>

1927
02:22:42,720 --> 02:22:44,722
Get a hold of yourself, Tsunade!

1928
02:22:45,153 --> 02:22:46,405
What is going on?

1929
02:22:53,856 --> 02:22:55,817
<i>I can't move!</i>

1930
02:22:57,694 --> 02:22:58,861
<i>Naruto!</i>

1931
02:23:02,574 --> 02:23:04,284
Naruto, don't do it right now!

1932
02:23:09,961 --> 02:23:14,382
<i>The light can't penetrate
that Susano'o?</i>

1933
02:23:20,625 --> 02:23:25,630
<i>His Rinnegan can counter
even this jutsu?</i>

1934
02:23:27,141 --> 02:23:28,489
Don't go outside right now.

1935
02:23:28,808 --> 02:23:31,227
Without this Susano'o
that my eye made,

1936
02:23:31,269 --> 02:23:33,479
you'd get bound up in
his genjutsu as well!

1937
02:23:33,813 --> 02:23:36,482
Also, his shadows are outside...

1938
02:23:36,774 --> 02:23:38,776
If you and I fall, it's all over!

1939
02:23:39,569 --> 02:23:40,695
We need to bide our time.

1940
02:23:46,159 --> 02:23:48,077
<i>This is the Deep Forest Emergence!</i>

1941
02:23:48,341 --> 02:23:51,545
<i>He's binding people using
the Divine Tree's life energy!</i>

1942
02:23:57,295 --> 02:23:58,921
Why am I not affected?!

1943
02:24:16,659 --> 02:24:17,701
<i>Yamato!</i>

1944
02:24:45,108 --> 02:24:47,586
What's going on?!

1945
02:25:03,290 --> 02:25:05,208
What's going on outside right now?

1946
02:25:08,157 --> 02:25:09,075
Sasuke?

1947
02:25:09,117 --> 02:25:11,077
What difference will it make,
knowing that?

1948
02:25:12,451 --> 02:25:14,661
There is nothing
you can do right now.

1949
02:25:15,374 --> 02:25:17,126
Sasuke... That's not the point.

1950
02:25:18,246 --> 02:25:20,540
Naruto and I also want to know.

1951
02:25:22,092 --> 02:25:24,010
In order to analyze our next move,

1952
02:25:24,507 --> 02:25:25,311
Sakura is...

1953
02:25:25,336 --> 02:25:26,337
Kakashi...

1954
02:25:26,686 --> 02:25:28,636
You're being just like Sakura now.

1955
02:25:29,262 --> 02:25:30,394
Just be quiet for a bit.

1956
02:25:30,419 --> 02:25:31,718
Hey, Sasuke!

1957
02:25:32,086 --> 02:25:33,838
We need to work as a team!

1958
02:25:34,434 --> 02:25:37,437
Team 7 needs to work together
to bring Madara down!

1959
02:25:37,678 --> 02:25:40,515
You're right.
There's nothing I can do right now...

1960
02:25:40,648 --> 02:25:41,816
Kakashi-sensei!

1961
02:25:42,525 --> 02:25:45,278
If you can analyze what's outside
with your left eye,

1962
02:25:45,820 --> 02:25:47,071
Sasuke...

1963
02:25:47,383 --> 02:25:51,467
you should be the one to lead Team 7...

1964
02:25:51,492 --> 02:25:52,493
Huh?!

1965
02:25:53,100 --> 02:25:58,541
I doubt he's better at planning
than either you or Sakura!

1966
02:25:59,250 --> 02:26:01,002
Although he may be
better than me...

1967
02:26:01,531 --> 02:26:02,491
Anyway...

1968
02:26:02,920 --> 02:26:05,256
Madara has activated his jutsu.

1969
02:26:06,235 --> 02:26:07,570
It's a powerful genjutsu.

1970
02:26:08,720 --> 02:26:13,225
I suspect everyone outside
has fallen under its spell.

1971
02:26:15,391 --> 02:26:16,684
We might be the only ones

1972
02:26:17,226 --> 02:26:18,561
left unaffected.

1973
02:26:20,194 --> 02:26:21,606
The Infinite Tsukuyomi, huh?

1974
02:26:22,743 --> 02:26:24,745
So right about now, everyone's...

1975
02:26:25,943 --> 02:26:27,236
Inside a dream.

1976
02:26:51,844 --> 02:26:52,845
<i>Lord Kiba!</i>

1977
02:26:54,392 --> 02:26:57,587
I think I'll start by establishing
a new holiday called Dog Day!

1978
02:26:59,393 --> 02:27:00,728
It's the Hokage's Decree!

1979
02:27:04,524 --> 02:27:06,818
Everyone will own a dog!

1980
02:27:07,109 --> 02:27:08,319
Go get a dog!

1981
02:27:08,694 --> 02:27:10,446
It's the Hokage's Decree!

1982
02:27:17,078 --> 02:27:19,497
I've finally found a new species!

1983
02:27:21,707 --> 02:27:22,708
There, there...

1984
02:27:27,588 --> 02:27:28,965
<i>Wow!</i>

1985
02:27:29,924 --> 02:27:32,593
What a feast! This looks so tasty!

1986
02:27:32,635 --> 02:27:35,721
I went all out and cooked
all this just for you, dear!

1987
02:27:36,013 --> 02:27:38,516
Looks like you've found a fan!

1988
02:27:38,558 --> 02:27:40,229
Thanks for the food!

1989
02:27:43,437 --> 02:27:46,065
<i>How many times
do I have to tell you?!</i>

1990
02:27:46,315 --> 02:27:48,234
If you're going to be late
coming back from a mission,

1991
02:27:48,276 --> 02:27:49,527
let me know!

1992
02:27:50,152 --> 02:27:51,696
I made dinner for nothing,

1993
02:27:51,737 --> 02:27:53,531
- Marriage is such a drag.
- And you kept me waiting.

1994
02:27:53,573 --> 02:27:54,933
I think I'll pass.

1995
02:27:54,958 --> 02:27:57,535
- Haven't you learned after all these years?
- Yeah.

1996
02:28:00,663 --> 02:28:02,582
<i>I won't let you have Ino.</i>

1997
02:28:03,403 --> 02:28:05,697
Ino is my woman... Get lost!

1998
02:28:05,960 --> 02:28:07,795
No, she is my woman.

1999
02:28:08,178 --> 02:28:10,762
Stop fighting, both of you!

2000
02:28:11,807 --> 02:28:13,642
My daughter's so popular.

2001
02:28:14,427 --> 02:28:17,597
This is such a pain!

2002
02:28:22,226 --> 02:28:24,353
<i>Great Leaf Hurricane!</i>

2003
02:28:29,859 --> 02:28:31,527
Youth prevails!

2004
02:28:31,839 --> 02:28:33,090
Oh, Lee!

2005
02:28:34,557 --> 02:28:35,433
I love you!

2006
02:28:35,656 --> 02:28:37,450
S-Sakura!

2007
02:28:40,119 --> 02:28:41,787
- <i>Sai!</i>
- <i>Sai!</i>

2008
02:28:42,269 --> 02:28:43,479
Oh, Sai.

2009
02:28:43,664 --> 02:28:44,916
Hey, Sai.

2010
02:28:45,003 --> 02:28:46,254
Good morning, everyone.

2011
02:28:46,344 --> 02:28:47,345
'Morning.

2012
02:28:47,571 --> 02:28:49,490
You have a really nice smile,
as usual.

2013
02:28:49,515 --> 02:28:50,337
Do you think so?

2014
02:28:50,546 --> 02:28:52,481
You really do have
a beautiful smile, Sai.

2015
02:28:52,506 --> 02:28:53,716
It is super cool!

2016
02:28:53,758 --> 02:28:54,425
Oh...

2017
02:28:54,450 --> 02:28:58,329
Sai! Your smile's the best
in the Hidden Leaf!

2018
02:29:03,717 --> 02:29:05,511
<i>I've finally perfected it!</i>

2019
02:29:06,812 --> 02:29:09,774
It flies! It moves!
My ultimate puppet!

2020
02:29:10,083 --> 02:29:11,918
He embodies all the dreams
of the Sand!

2021
02:29:12,087 --> 02:29:14,714
You will be the guardian deity
of the Sand!

2022
02:29:19,317 --> 02:29:20,566
Let's go!

2023
02:29:27,917 --> 02:29:29,585
<i>Elder Sister, Elder Sister!</i>

2024
02:29:31,112 --> 02:29:33,906
Please help me. I need your wisdom!

2025
02:29:34,757 --> 02:29:37,176
Calm down. What is it?

2026
02:29:37,369 --> 02:29:38,162
You see...

2027
02:29:38,187 --> 02:29:39,268
Hold on!

2028
02:29:39,293 --> 02:29:41,336
Let me discuss something
with you first!

2029
02:29:41,597 --> 02:29:45,685
You're the Kazekage now.
Make your own decisions.

2030
02:29:45,768 --> 02:29:46,560
No!

2031
02:29:46,602 --> 02:29:49,063
I really want to hear your opinion!

2032
02:29:49,105 --> 02:29:50,477
Me too! Please, Elder Sister!

2033
02:29:50,544 --> 02:29:52,504
It just has to be you!
Elder Sister!

2034
02:29:52,733 --> 02:29:53,442
Elder Sister!

2035
02:29:53,484 --> 02:29:54,485
Elder Sister!

2036
02:29:58,002 --> 02:30:00,505
My little brothers are so hopeless.

2037
02:30:13,941 --> 02:30:16,152
<i>And then Gaara—!</i>

2038
02:30:17,181 --> 02:30:19,308
Is that so? At the Academy?

2039
02:30:19,333 --> 02:30:20,125
Uh-huh!

2040
02:30:20,363 --> 02:30:21,262
Lord Gaara.

2041
02:30:23,178 --> 02:30:25,347
Your friend is here to see you.

2042
02:30:25,897 --> 02:30:26,652
Hey!

2043
02:30:28,080 --> 02:30:29,457
What are we going to play today?

2044
02:30:29,770 --> 02:30:31,355
Let's go outside!

2045
02:30:31,543 --> 02:30:32,256
Gaara...

2046
02:30:34,337 --> 02:30:35,630
Don't stay out too late.

2047
02:30:36,523 --> 02:30:37,186
Uh-huh.

2048
02:30:51,417 --> 02:30:52,793
So when can we get outta here?

2049
02:30:53,184 --> 02:30:55,436
It seems the genjutsu
is cast by the moonlight.

2050
02:30:56,505 --> 02:30:58,966
Which will gradually wane.

2051
02:31:00,217 --> 02:31:02,178
But as long as there's light,
it's useless.
