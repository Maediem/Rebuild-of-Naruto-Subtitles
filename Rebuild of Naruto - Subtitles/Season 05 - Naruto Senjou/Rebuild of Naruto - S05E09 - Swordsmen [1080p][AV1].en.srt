1
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,348
Captain Kakashi...

2
00:01:40,197 --> 00:01:41,267
What's the enemy up to?

3
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,938
There are no signs of life,
even the enemy's.

4
00:01:45,468 --> 00:01:47,011
It's completely silent.

5
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:51,986
What's going on?
I don't think they would just give up.

6
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,657
The key to a shinobi battle is
psychological warfare.

7
00:01:56,852 --> 00:01:59,855
I don't like doing what
the enemy wants us to do,

8
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,756
but we should use this as
a chance to rest.

9
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:06,515
Everyone, rest up and
recover your chakra!

10
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,295
But be on your guard!

11
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,257
We'll scout the area
every half an hour!

12
00:02:12,907 --> 00:02:16,536
We must be ready to resume fighting
at a moment's notice!

13
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:18,735
That is all!

14
00:02:21,671 --> 00:02:23,798
Guy, you should rest a little too.

15
00:02:24,512 --> 00:02:28,266
Did you think that I could sleep
at a time like this?!

16
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,025
I understand how you feel, but...

17
00:02:31,477 --> 00:02:32,322
Captain Kakashi...

18
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,863
We've received that item from HQ.

19
00:02:47,145 --> 00:02:49,961
<i>Reanimation...
This jutsu is unforgivable!</i>

20
00:02:50,616 --> 00:02:53,953
<i>Sai, use the Foundation's
Sealing Jutsu.</i>

21
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:55,550
<i>Follow my lead!</i>

22
00:02:55,788 --> 00:02:58,374
<i>But I still can't use that jutsu...</i>

23
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,529
<i>Danzo thought highly of you,
didn't he?</i>

24
00:03:02,547 --> 00:03:04,549
<i>There's no need to suppress
your emotions anymore!</i>

25
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:14,722
Hey, Sai, sorry to bother you
while you're resting.

26
00:03:15,783 --> 00:03:16,480
That's okay.

27
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,867
This just came from headquarters.

28
00:03:21,755 --> 00:03:23,828
You need this for
your Sealing Jutsu, right?

29
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,374
Lee...

30
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,046
Is it the enemy?!

31
00:03:34,986 --> 00:03:36,529
It looks like you can still fight.

32
00:03:36,834 --> 00:03:37,835
Yes, sir!

33
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,094
I, Rock Lee, the Blue Beast,

34
00:03:40,195 --> 00:03:42,197
do not know the meaning
of the word "exhaustion"!

35
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,337
I want you to be Sai's bodyguard.

36
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,977
He won't be able to
defend himself well

37
00:03:48,152 --> 00:03:49,862
while he's preparing
his Sealing Jutsu.

38
00:03:50,286 --> 00:03:51,371
Leave it to me!

39
00:03:52,703 --> 00:03:54,163
I will risk my life for him!

40
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,071
I leave it to you, Sai.

41
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,661
It's time to change shifts.

42
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:05,703
Okay.

43
00:04:06,261 --> 00:04:07,262
How are things?

44
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:08,790
There's been no change.

45
00:04:09,564 --> 00:04:12,400
It's morning and
they still haven't shown up.

46
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,309
It sure is quiet.

47
00:04:15,294 --> 00:04:17,004
It's like the calm
before the storm.

48
00:04:18,472 --> 00:04:20,683
I hope it means
the festival's over.

49
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,062
Enemy attack!

50
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,881
They're here!

51
00:04:34,787 --> 00:04:35,788
This way!

52
00:04:40,032 --> 00:04:41,033
He ran away?

53
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:53,398
Damn it! Is he over here?!

54
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:06,812
Hey... Where did everyone go?

55
00:05:26,421 --> 00:05:27,714
There he is! This way!

56
00:05:30,445 --> 00:05:31,988
Even though he's cornered,

57
00:05:32,013 --> 00:05:33,931
he doesn't look like
he's going to fight us.

58
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,668
The enemy sent
their weaker forces into battle.

59
00:05:37,758 --> 00:05:38,759
It seems like hiding in the trees

60
00:05:38,784 --> 00:05:40,869
and using guerrilla warfare
is their main tactic.

61
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:43,992
They want us to become bold and pursue
our targets, and once we've scattered,

62
00:05:44,017 --> 00:05:46,227
they'll destroy
the Shinobi Alliance one by one.

63
00:05:46,252 --> 00:05:48,406
I hate to admit it,
but they wanted us

64
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,641
to become overconfident
after defeating Zabuza!

65
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,770
What are we going to do?!
Things are going downhill!

66
00:05:54,624 --> 00:05:56,042
We need to regroup.

67
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,733
Send a message to each team

68
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,361
telling them to work with
at least two other teams!

69
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,598
Okay, got it! And what will you do?

70
00:06:05,663 --> 00:06:07,164
I'm worried about
the squads behind us.

71
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:08,503
If I were the enemy,

72
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:11,204
I would use this confusion to
cut off our support squads!

73
00:06:12,032 --> 00:06:14,667
The rear guards are tough and

74
00:06:14,692 --> 00:06:17,465
have the restraints and seals
to fight against Reanimation.

75
00:06:18,042 --> 00:06:21,254
Well, I don't understand!
I'll just let you handle it!

76
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,527
You heard us, right?!
Send a message to all teams!

77
00:06:25,926 --> 00:06:27,803
Do not pursue the enemy
if you see them!

78
00:06:28,332 --> 00:06:31,586
Try to stick together and
we'll destroy them one by one!

79
00:06:32,064 --> 00:06:32,648
Yes, sir!

80
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:33,893
Guy-sensei!

81
00:06:34,593 --> 00:06:35,719
Sorry I'm late!

82
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:36,526
Hey!

83
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:37,960
Sai! Lee!

84
00:06:38,376 --> 00:06:39,961
Perfect timing. Follow me!

85
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:41,618
We're going to prepare a seal!

86
00:06:41,643 --> 00:06:42,227
Yes, sir!

87
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:43,435
You can count on me!

88
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,447
We won't let them get their way!

89
00:06:47,489 --> 00:06:48,991
<i>Earth Style:
Rampart of Flowing Soil!</i>

90
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,000
Ensui, prepare
the Shadow Paralysis!

91
00:06:58,179 --> 00:06:58,884
Got it!

92
00:07:07,585 --> 00:07:08,752
I found you...

93
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:11,733
One more time!

94
00:07:15,153 --> 00:07:20,809
Defending against the Blunt Blade,
Kabutowari, is futile!

95
00:07:32,114 --> 00:07:33,115
Form a line of defense...

96
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,815
Trying to block me is meaningless.

97
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:38,660
You still don't seem to understand!

98
00:07:43,378 --> 00:07:44,838
This next attack will be your last!

99
00:07:45,225 --> 00:07:46,226
It's not over yet!

100
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,014
That's...

101
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:55,559
Captain Kakashi!

102
00:07:56,011 --> 00:07:58,764
I hope you don't think
this will be over soon!

103
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,611
Sai, please begin!

104
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:07,940
Okay...

105
00:08:08,157 --> 00:08:12,119
Let's see what
your Sealing Jutsu can do!

106
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,419
<i>I've made up my mind.</i>

107
00:08:24,884 --> 00:08:26,552
<i>But I've been told to suppress</i>

108
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:29,208
<i>my emotions
ever since I was little.</i>

109
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:35,515
<i>Is it really possible for me to
master this Sealing Jutsu?</i>

110
00:08:51,146 --> 00:08:52,147
You're back...

111
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,618
Lord Danzo... What is this?

112
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,830
You must assimilate the mass
of negative feelings

113
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,917
you hold deep within you
and train diligently.

114
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,545
This jutsu is the reason why

115
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:08,756
I raised you all from the time
you were young.

116
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:12,343
Try to gain complete control
over your emotions.

117
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:17,223
Release your negative feelings
and restrain them.

118
00:09:22,286 --> 00:09:24,788
<i>I couldn't suppress
my emotions that time...</i>

119
00:09:25,752 --> 00:09:29,299
<i>Can I suppress my emotions now
better than I could then?</i>

120
00:09:30,386 --> 00:09:33,097
<i>If anything, it's even harder now!</i>

121
00:09:36,427 --> 00:09:40,347
I see there's still someone who's
a bit of a challenge in this world.

122
00:09:41,258 --> 00:09:43,844
Even if you're one of the Seven
Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist,

123
00:09:44,248 --> 00:09:46,542
we're not going to let you
win so easily.

124
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,672
Shut up!

125
00:09:55,165 --> 00:09:57,834
<i>That eye looks dangerous, but...</i>

126
00:10:01,282 --> 00:10:04,827
If I thrust my sword
towards you, I can win!

127
00:10:05,282 --> 00:10:08,535
There's no way to block
my Helmet Splitter.

128
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,776
Who said anything about blocking?

129
00:10:13,715 --> 00:10:15,008
Your defense is weak!

130
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:23,951
Ensui!

131
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,251
Yes, sir!

132
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:28,479
Hold him with Shadow Paralysis
until the seal is ready.

133
00:10:29,124 --> 00:10:30,125
Understood.

134
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,675
The rest of you, group up with
the squad in front. Follow me!

135
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,564
<i>Shadow Stitching Jutsu!</i>

136
00:10:57,847 --> 00:10:58,848
<i>Impossible...</i>

137
00:11:01,557 --> 00:11:02,766
<i>Run away, little brother.</i>

138
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:07,792
<i>Our bodies are indestructible.
There's no way you can win!</i>

139
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,086
<i>Shin...</i>

140
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,006
<i>Brother, snap out of it!</i>

141
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,845
<i>Secret Black Technique:
Salamander!</i>

142
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,100
<i>Brother!</i>

143
00:11:33,245 --> 00:11:34,246
Sai...

144
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,321
<i>I heard it was difficult,</i>

145
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,989
<i>but he really looks
like he's suffering.</i>

146
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,449
Someone's coming!

147
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,660
An Explosive Style User!

148
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,497
<i>This is not good!</i>

149
00:11:48,313 --> 00:11:49,314
Sai!

150
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,001
Hurry up with the seal!

151
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,712
Lee can't handle this by himself.

152
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,147
I need to assist him!

153
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,924
There's no need to worry!

154
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,510
I won't forgive the Akatsuki!

155
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,346
They're controlling the dead
using Reanimation.

156
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,473
I'm seriously mad.

157
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,435
Is there any reason
why I would lose?

158
00:12:07,886 --> 00:12:09,812
No! There isn't!

159
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:23,951
<i>How?</i>

160
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:28,038
<i>I don't sense any negative feelings
coming from Lee's anger.</i>

161
00:12:29,201 --> 00:12:32,913
<i>Why? Doesn't anger come
from negative feelings?</i>

162
00:12:49,981 --> 00:12:50,695
<i>This is bad!</i>

163
00:12:51,825 --> 00:12:52,826
How dare you...

164
00:12:53,302 --> 00:12:56,221
How dare you harm my friend!

165
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,501
<i>I see...</i>

166
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,449
<i>I see... The source of Lee's anger
is his feelings for his friends.</i>

167
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:06,619
<i>But I can't do that...</i>

168
00:13:07,545 --> 00:13:08,546
<i>No!</i>

169
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:13,584
<i>I'm different from how I was then.
I have friends now.</i>

170
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:20,467
<i>And now, I have a lot of
feelings towards those friends.</i>

171
00:13:24,454 --> 00:13:27,483
<i>A Sealing Jutsu that becomes more
powerful when I release my emotions.</i>

172
00:13:28,626 --> 00:13:31,670
<i>But those emotions don't have
to be negative ones</i>

173
00:13:31,695 --> 00:13:33,572
<i>that come from anger or sorrow!</i>

174
00:13:45,963 --> 00:13:46,964
Sai!

175
00:13:47,128 --> 00:13:48,129
Lee...

176
00:13:48,443 --> 00:13:50,987
I still haven't given you
a nickname, have I?

177
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,583
I'll think of one,
once this war is over.

178
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,734
Sai! Do it.

179
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:12,726
<i>Sealing Jutsu:</i>

180
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,395
<i>Crouched Tiger Bullet.</i>

181
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,363
<i>Okay! We caught him!</i>

182
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,482
<i>Return!</i>

183
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,550
Whatever the defense...

184
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,894
Wait! Don't go after him!

185
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,233
Sai!

186
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,162
<i>Ninja Art: Needle Senbon!</i>

187
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,256
Weaklings!

188
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:25,549
Captain...

189
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:30,304
Wait, don't do anything until
we can get a handle on the situation.

190
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,097
Captain Monga!

191
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,184
The enemy isn't attacking
in large squads...

192
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,936
but they are using
guerrilla tactics.

193
00:15:37,454 --> 00:15:39,706
We're facing the Seven Ninja
Swordsmen of the Mist.

194
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,402
He's strong even without
a ninja blade!

195
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,196
But there's only one of him.

196
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,616
If we surround him with more people
and attack in waves...

197
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,242
that should create
an opportunity for us...

198
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:56,997
Seems like it's a tough fight.

199
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,696
It is him we're fighting...

200
00:16:00,182 --> 00:16:04,937
Hey, Maki, why aren't they attacking
with a large squad?

201
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,382
I don't know...

202
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,846
Anyway, we need to figure out
what the enemy is going to do

203
00:16:09,871 --> 00:16:11,414
and put together a strategy.

204
00:16:21,196 --> 00:16:22,489
How many enemies are there?

205
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,442
I don't know.
They just suddenly appeared.

206
00:16:25,727 --> 00:16:28,271
Maki, Ruka! Fall back!

207
00:16:28,503 --> 00:16:30,672
Perhaps you should tell them
to run as fast as they can...

208
00:16:32,146 --> 00:16:34,064
If they don't, they'll go boom.

209
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,828
Gari of the Explosion Style...

210
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,372
I never expected to face you...

211
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:43,510
Yeah, you don't have
enough men to take me on.

212
00:16:45,018 --> 00:16:47,980
That's exactly what
we want you to think...

213
00:16:48,527 --> 00:16:52,531
<i>I get it! The flashy guerrilla tactics are
just to scatter our forces.</i>

214
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,890
You were targeting the support squads
in the rear from the beginning, huh?

215
00:16:57,789 --> 00:17:00,625
That's the quickest way
to end the battle, isn't it?

216
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:04,462
Besides, I've been brought
back to life and

217
00:17:04,487 --> 00:17:08,699
I can't stand being immobile
because of a Sealing Jutsu.

218
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,572
I never expected someone
like you to be satisfied

219
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,407
with being just a puppet...

220
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:18,162
You've never been dead,
so you wouldn't understand.

221
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,582
Death isn't something
to take lightly!

222
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,084
<i>Earth Style: Mud Slide!</i>

223
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,213
Don't get near him!

224
00:17:34,825 --> 00:17:39,534
Sorry, your advice has
fallen on deaf ears...

225
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:41,894
Captain Monga, I...

226
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,520
You guys stay there!

227
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,274
I can handle this by myself.

228
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,276
How fun...

229
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,613
But you can't stop me
with just spirit!

230
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,702
Can you defend yourself against
Explosion Style with just that?

231
00:18:18,143 --> 00:18:20,869
Maki, seal him away right away.

232
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,715
Captain!

233
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,066
<i>This jutsu is...</i>

234
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:40,577
<i>Pakura-sensei...</i>

235
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:49,545
Sai of the Hidden Leaf sealed away
one of the Ninja Swordsmen!

236
00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:54,870
<i>Looks like you did well, Sai.</i>

237
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,178
<i>I just hope we can
keep morale high.</i>

238
00:19:06,935 --> 00:19:08,102
Help me!

239
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:11,918
What's wrong?

240
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:16,113
Strings are controlling my body...

241
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:53,393
<i>He's crucifying them alive and
taking pleasure in their suffering...</i>

242
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,668
Stop!

243
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,592
Stop!

244
00:20:22,725 --> 00:20:24,765
Is this some kind of game for you?

245
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,228
Ran!

246
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,104
You are unforgivable!

247
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,650
I feel sorry for the legends
of past generations

248
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:37,152
who are being forced to fight
against their will.

249
00:20:37,662 --> 00:20:41,624
It pains me...
You revel in killing.

250
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,452
I hate to think that
we're both called shinobi...

251
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,413
Stop being so full of yourself.

252
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:55,754
Who do you think
you're pointing that at?!

253
00:20:58,747 --> 00:21:01,374
That belongs to the Seven Ninja
Swordsmen of the Mist!

254
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:06,348
An outsider wielding
the Executioner's Blade?

255
00:21:07,453 --> 00:21:08,724
I don't like it one bit!

256
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,815
He's mine!

257
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:35,544
I'm going to kill you and take back
the Executioner's Blade!

258
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,504
No, I will.

259
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,507
I'll kill you if you get in my way!

260
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,552
I'm already dead.

261
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:50,684
<i>Going up against these two alone
is going to be rough, but...</i>

262
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,688
Looks like you're backed up
against a wall, buddy!

263
00:21:58,136 --> 00:21:59,436
<i>Severe...</i>

264
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,071
<i>Leaf Hurricane!</i>

265
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:12,289
I'm Might Guy,
the Hidden Leaf's Noble Blue Beast!

266
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,083
Sorry I'm late, Kakashi.

267
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,210
Thanks, Guy.

268
00:22:18,561 --> 00:22:21,022
You're the one who wanted us
to regroup

269
00:22:21,047 --> 00:22:23,549
because it was dangerous
to work in squads.

270
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,969
So why are you doing this
by yourself?

271
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,523
Furthermore, you're fighting two of

272
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:30,968
the Seven Ninja Swordsmen
of the Mist.

273
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,603
I wanted to save as many people
as I could and got in over my head.

274
00:22:34,628 --> 00:22:35,713
I figured that was the case.

275
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,273
Anyway, we should get her away
from here while we can.

276
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:39,668
Yeah, thanks.

277
00:22:40,698 --> 00:22:43,910
It's kind of creepy to see you
being so grateful.

278
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:47,407
But... I guess your opponents were
just strong enough

279
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:48,617
to make you feel that way.

280
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:56,750
Where am I?

281
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,837
He... He killed my comrades!

282
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,089
I know.

283
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,549
We're going to defeat the enemy,

284
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,218
so you go regroup with
the main regiment.

285
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:08,847
B-But...

286
00:23:09,694 --> 00:23:13,281
When we fight them,
you'll only get in our way.

287
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,023
Be careful.

288
00:23:25,668 --> 00:23:26,669
Now then...

289
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:30,450
How dare you treat our comrades
like they were your toys.

290
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:31,917
Be careful, Guy.

291
00:23:32,849 --> 00:23:35,601
Kushimaru Kuriarare, who wields
the Long Blade the Sewing Needle...

292
00:23:35,702 --> 00:23:38,330
And Jinpachi Nanashi, who wields
the Explosive Blade, the Splatter...

293
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:40,651
One killed his master and
the other killed his older brother.

294
00:23:40,775 --> 00:23:44,654
Aside from that, they've committed
countless acts of cruelty.

295
00:23:45,805 --> 00:23:48,391
If you get in my way,
I'll kill you too!

296
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,765
I guess you could call them
the cold-blooded combo.

297
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,434
We've got to stay focused!

298
00:23:55,954 --> 00:23:57,497
That's no problem!

299
00:23:57,624 --> 00:24:01,295
They may be the cold-blooded combo,
but we're the comrade combo!

300
00:24:03,063 --> 00:24:06,945
No one is a match for the Hidden Leaf's
invincible comrade combo!

301
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:13,411
They're open to attack.

302
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,954
They've underestimated my speed.

303
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:23,920
<i>His swings are big because
of that gimmick. But...</i>

304
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:35,724
He doesn't have his Long Blade!

305
00:24:43,005 --> 00:24:44,173
Be careful, Guy!

306
00:24:48,936 --> 00:24:51,689
<i>Ninja Art Long Blade:
Stitching Spider!</i>

307
00:24:59,484 --> 00:25:01,152
This thing!

308
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:07,839
<i>Explosive Blade Jutsu:
Multiple Explosions of Death!</i>

309
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,355
You saved me again, Kakashi.

310
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,440
<i>Earth Style: Multi Mud Wall!</i>

311
00:25:33,413 --> 00:25:35,457
I was naïve.

312
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:39,704
I thought I had all the data on the
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist...

313
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:43,601
But I never expected them to take
advantage of being reanimated that well.

314
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,919
Kakashi? Did they...

315
00:25:46,633 --> 00:25:49,093
Yeah... They got my eye.

316
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,842
I think it's temporary,
but this is bad.

317
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:57,389
I've survived many
tough situations like this.

318
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,808
There's something
I remember every time...

319
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,071
This is bad! Guy!

320
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,492
Stone shinobi...

321
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,661
They use jutsu formulas
that cover a wide area.

322
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,338
D-Didn't you run out of chakra?

323
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,721
<i>Chidori!</i>

324
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,961
<i>He cut through a lightning bolt
with Chidori?</i>

325
00:27:10,617 --> 00:27:13,036
<i>I thought he was out of chakra!</i>

326
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,842
Are you all right, Kakashi?

327
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,969
How strange...

328
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:20,639
I thought I was out of chakra...

329
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:24,388
But when I thought about saving
my friends, it came out of nowhere.

330
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,401
You should rest, Kakashi.

331
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,528
I'll handle the rest.

332
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,406
But you can't run on those legs...

333
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,076
If I can't use my legs,
I'll use my arms.

334
00:27:41,633 --> 00:27:44,323
If I can't use that,
I'll use my fingers or my mouth...

335
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:48,375
and struggle all the way until
the end to save my friends.

336
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,544
Just like you did now...

337
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,487
Friend, huh?

338
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,848
You can't see.
Don't push yourself, Kakashi.

339
00:28:04,453 --> 00:28:06,122
If I can't see,
I'll sense things by sound.

340
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,396
If I can't do that,
I'll use smell or even my skin...

341
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,816
and struggle all the way
until the end to save my friends.

342
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:16,861
You remember that time too...
Let's go!

343
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,571
Yeah!

344
00:28:33,101 --> 00:28:34,228
C'mon!

345
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,203
Let's do this!

346
00:29:10,785 --> 00:29:11,827
Don't underestimate me!

347
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:18,298
It seems like repeating
our rival challenge

348
00:29:19,504 --> 00:29:21,005
wasn't a waste of time, after all.

349
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,929
Even if I can't see you,
I know exactly where you are!

350
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,474
By matching your movements...

351
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,477
I can even tell where the enemy is.
It's as if I can see.

352
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:40,737
You're in the way!

353
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,055
You should disappear!

354
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:47,285
I'll deal with you first!

355
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,080
You don't think of your comrades
as comrades...

356
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:54,167
You were never a match for us!

357
00:29:54,569 --> 00:29:55,570
Shut up!

358
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,413
Substitution Jutsu?

359
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,310
You idiot!

360
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,353
I can't dodge it!

361
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:21,320
<i>Did we succeed?</i>

362
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,862
Damn it...

363
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:27,075
I'm done with this stupid fight!

364
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,868
Get back, Kakashi!

365
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,972
I'll use my Explosion Blade
to blow up this whole area.

366
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,415
<i>Shadow Stitching Jutsu!</i>

367
00:30:35,215 --> 00:30:36,759
I-I can't move!

368
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,379
Captain Kakashi!

369
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:42,549
I've brought the Sealing Team!

370
00:30:45,433 --> 00:30:47,804
You can see again, Kakashi?

371
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:48,991
Yeah...

372
00:30:51,019 --> 00:30:53,188
Seal these two away.

373
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,019
Yes, sir!

374
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,826
Stop hiding!

375
00:31:10,179 --> 00:31:13,515
Isn't there anyone here that can send
shockwaves through my heart?

376
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,957
<i>Lightning Style: Lighting Fang!</i>

377
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,050
Cowards aren't my type!

378
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,184
Where are the reinforcements?!

379
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,397
As punishment...
I'm going to burn you to a crisp!

380
00:31:41,078 --> 00:31:43,860
<i>Lighting Style: Thunder Gate!</i>

381
00:32:00,306 --> 00:32:01,891
Hang on, Yurui!

382
00:32:05,678 --> 00:32:10,307
It's over...
Everything's... going dark...

383
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,013
Don't give up, Yurui!

384
00:32:12,588 --> 00:32:14,132
Help is on the way!

385
00:32:14,957 --> 00:32:20,337
Nurui... It's in...
your hands now...

386
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:26,861
Damn it! I've had it with this!

387
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,571
How many have died already?

388
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:32,575
Is this what war is?!

389
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:39,165
Are we the only survivors?

390
00:32:41,482 --> 00:32:42,961
It looks that way.

391
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,965
I'll take command from now on.

392
00:32:47,395 --> 00:32:50,148
I have seniority here.

393
00:32:51,898 --> 00:32:55,109
Ameyuri Ringo went after the
other squad in the other direction.

394
00:32:55,356 --> 00:32:56,941
But she'll be back.

395
00:32:57,466 --> 00:32:59,385
We have to decide
what to do quickly.

396
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,981
It's obvious. We retreat.

397
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,149
Are we running away?

398
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:07,204
Just because she's one of
the Seven Ninja Swordsmen?

399
00:33:07,229 --> 00:33:11,650
Are you suggesting we take on
Ameyuri Ringo?

400
00:33:12,216 --> 00:33:13,068
Well...

401
00:33:14,566 --> 00:33:15,994
That's not like you, Omoi.

402
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:20,248
I thought you were
the cautious type, just like me.

403
00:33:21,422 --> 00:33:23,550
War is not the place
for revenge.

404
00:33:24,051 --> 00:33:26,688
And besides, we don't have a chance

405
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,297
against someone with a Ninja Blade.

406
00:33:28,723 --> 00:33:32,468
They are like elephants or tigers...
And we're just mere ants.

407
00:33:33,694 --> 00:33:36,447
Then why the hell are we here?!

408
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:37,849
Don't get full of yourself, Omoi.

409
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,976
Are you trying to be a hero now?

410
00:33:42,769 --> 00:33:45,355
We'll create a diversion for
Ameyuri Ringo and make our escape.

411
00:33:50,019 --> 00:33:54,064
How boring... Not a single soul
to give me a thrill.

412
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,117
Oh, that's right.

413
00:33:56,306 --> 00:33:58,808
There were two or three
more back there.

414
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,039
Maybe they're more my type.

415
00:34:03,405 --> 00:34:06,294
<i>Damn it... If we keep running
and running...</i>

416
00:34:06,424 --> 00:34:09,052
<i>Pretty soon,
we'll circle the globe.</i>

417
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:13,051
<i>And if we keep circling
the globe over and over again,</i>

418
00:34:13,254 --> 00:34:15,715
<i>we'll forget why the hell
we're fighting.</i>

419
00:34:17,801 --> 00:34:20,678
<i>And no one will think
that I'm still alive.</i>

420
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,506
<i>I'll keep running and
running until I die.</i>

421
00:34:25,365 --> 00:34:27,033
<i>If that's the case, then...</i>

422
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:31,277
Captain! Are we still going to
keep running away?

423
00:34:31,875 --> 00:34:34,213
If we keep running,
maybe the reinforcements will arrive

424
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,865
and take care of that bitch.

425
00:34:37,705 --> 00:34:39,373
<i>Waiting for others to bail us out?!</i>

426
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,082
What are you doing?

427
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:47,919
We have to make it look
like we put up a fight...

428
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:51,297
Otherwise, who knows what
they'll say after the war.

429
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:56,103
<i>How stupid. Talk about ego...</i>

430
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,888
<i>And this trap is so obvious!</i>

431
00:34:59,131 --> 00:35:02,676
<i>It's like telling the enemy exactly
which way we're running.</i>

432
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:08,314
<i>Nothing good's going to come
from following this guy!</i>

433
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:16,248
<i>You can't run away from me.</i>

434
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:22,954
They call this a trap?

435
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:25,081
They must think I'm stupid.

436
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,132
I'm never going to let you go!

437
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:40,805
Just who is
this Ameyuri Ringo anyway?

438
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:44,350
A woman known to be an exceptional user
of the Lightning Style.

439
00:35:44,565 --> 00:35:47,161
Although she died young
from an incurable disease,

440
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:49,981
it's said she never lost her prey.

441
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,233
There's no escaping her?

442
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,443
That's enough, Kayui!

443
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,239
Nurui!

444
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,907
You knew this, and still...

445
00:36:05,555 --> 00:36:06,556
Here she comes!

446
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,184
Damn it!
She's faster than I thought.

447
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:13,921
<i>Of course, she's going to catch up!
This is such a lame strategy!</i>

448
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,227
We can't outrun her!

449
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:29,585
Let's fight!

450
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:30,653
No! It's no use!

451
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,107
How far can we run?!

452
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:35,067
She always gets her prey, right?!

453
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,402
I know!

454
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:42,033
Well, do you know that our lives
are in your hands?!

455
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,826
That's why we're retreating!

456
00:36:44,457 --> 00:36:46,084
How can you call yourself
a shinobi?!

457
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:49,081
Have you even thought about
our fallen comrades?!

458
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:52,293
Omoi! You don't understand Nurui!

459
00:36:52,813 --> 00:36:54,440
And Nurui, you too!

460
00:36:54,868 --> 00:36:55,494
Why don't...?!

461
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:56,520
Shut up, Kayui!

462
00:36:57,367 --> 00:36:58,226
I've...

463
00:36:59,547 --> 00:37:01,382
had enough of running!

464
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,227
Omoi...

465
00:37:19,644 --> 00:37:23,189
I know... about your reputation
in the village, Nurui.

466
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:25,785
Omoi! That's enough!

467
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:29,538
That your caution is just
a cover for your cowardice!

468
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,583
Well, I'm a cautious guy,
but I'm no coward!

469
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,126
Stop it, Omoi!

470
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,795
Fighting is useless right now!

471
00:37:36,786 --> 00:37:39,632
We can't be heroes!

472
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,634
The thought didn't even
cross my mind!

473
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,777
I just keep seeing Yurui's face
as he was dying!

474
00:37:51,805 --> 00:37:53,432
And even if we escape somehow,

475
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:57,275
I can't go on living with that image
constantly flashing through my mind.

476
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:07,576
Looks like Ameyuri Ringo is
still in pursuit of someone.

477
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,162
This isn't good...

478
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,708
There aren't any Allied Shinobi
units beyond this point.

479
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:17,753
The pursued are only making
themselves more isolated.

480
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:19,880
Let's hurry!

481
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,540
Oh, here's one.

482
00:38:24,565 --> 00:38:26,554
Someone who's willing to face me!

483
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,848
I'm avenging Yurui!

484
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,398
What? Running away so soon?

485
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,114
Fooled ya!

486
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,033
<i>Cloud Style: Deception Slice!</i>

487
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,328
No one tricks me!

488
00:38:50,793 --> 00:38:52,795
<i>Lightning Sword Style: Thunderbolt!</i>

489
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:03,132
<i>She's strong...
If I'm going to beat her,</i>

490
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,551
<i>I have to use the one
Bee taught me!</i>

491
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,386
<i>Hidden Mist Slice.</i>

492
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,722
Still not giving up?

493
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,891
At least you have some backbone.

494
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:16,395
<i>This sword style makes it difficult
to read the path of the blade!</i>

495
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,818
<i>I'm just beginning to
execute this jutsu!</i>

496
00:39:24,468 --> 00:39:26,637
<i>My personal style...
Hidden Mist Slice, Kai!</i>

497
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:29,950
Let's see you counter this!

498
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,495
Huh? They're all decoys?!

499
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:33,535
Gotcha!

500
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:35,748
<i>Lightning Style: Depth Charge!</i>

501
00:39:40,528 --> 00:39:42,030
You're not bad at all.

502
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:45,132
Most guys would be dead.

503
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:49,845
Sorry, but I'm really strong.

504
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:53,891
Omoi!

505
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,106
I won't kill you just yet.

506
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,941
Because I'm the type of person

507
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,984
who saves the things
I like to eat for last.

508
00:40:05,207 --> 00:40:06,208
Don't come!

509
00:40:06,505 --> 00:40:08,298
Nurui! Kayui!

510
00:40:19,457 --> 00:40:20,458
Nurui...

511
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:29,927
Nurui!

512
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,429
Are you all right, Nurui?!

513
00:40:38,278 --> 00:40:41,406
Did you have to act so foolishly?

514
00:40:42,657 --> 00:40:45,118
I'm sorry... For my sake...

515
00:40:45,954 --> 00:40:49,040
Damn right. Everything's ruined.

516
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,617
Now listen carefully...

517
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,369
Omoi...

518
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,914
Found you!

519
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,544
I won't let you get away.

520
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,924
Are you all right, Kayui?!

521
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,135
Yes...

522
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,507
Is there anyone else with you?

523
00:41:14,493 --> 00:41:17,079
Nurui and Omoi are up ahead...

524
00:41:17,591 --> 00:41:19,301
Ameyuri Ringo is there too, huh?

525
00:41:19,746 --> 00:41:22,318
And they're going to
bring her down.

526
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,696
Now then, are you prepared?

527
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:37,953
Fine... You want me to fight?
I'll fight then.

528
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,835
You're determined.
I'll give you that.

529
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,629
<i>Please let us get there in time!</i>

530
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:51,883
I have to, I mean,
we have to bring her down.

531
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:55,638
Nurui... Yurui...

532
00:41:56,285 --> 00:41:58,322
Bring me down?

533
00:41:58,347 --> 00:42:00,390
Are you still talking nonsense?

534
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:03,896
I planned to devour you
from the beginning!

535
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:08,067
Since 'Ringo' means apple,
and today's flavor is apple candy!

536
00:42:08,358 --> 00:42:10,693
Bring it on with
your strongest jutsu!

537
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:18,285
Too bad!
And you were my type too.

538
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:21,933
<i>Lightning Style: Thunder Gate!</i>

539
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,009
What is this?!

540
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,388
You trapped me?!

541
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,848
This is actually a bottomless marsh.

542
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,643
Once you're stuck,
you'll never get out.

543
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,854
And you're coming with me?

544
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,001
What a gentleman!

545
00:42:50,385 --> 00:42:52,846
<i>Yurui was my friend.</i>

546
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:56,366
<i>I'm the one who let
personal feelings interfere.</i>

547
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,770
<i>I wanted to avenge Yurui...</i>

548
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:05,708
<i>There was only one way
for us to beat her.</i>

549
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:09,003
<i>There is a bottomless marsh
up ahead.</i>

550
00:43:09,571 --> 00:43:11,698
<i>It's been covered with
an Earth Style lid.</i>

551
00:43:12,421 --> 00:43:14,631
<i>If she uses her Lightning Style there,</i>

552
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,802
<i>she'll sink into
this bottomless marsh.</i>

553
00:43:17,024 --> 00:43:19,478
<i>I planned to lure her there.</i>

554
00:43:21,003 --> 00:43:25,334
<i>Yurui, Kayui and I had made
a number of traps</i>

555
00:43:25,815 --> 00:43:28,397
<i>in preparation for a big battle.</i>

556
00:43:29,625 --> 00:43:32,420
<i>So you... weren't running away?</i>

557
00:43:33,598 --> 00:43:37,060
<i>Omoi, I know the limits
of my strength.</i>

558
00:43:38,052 --> 00:43:41,806
<i>But my plan won't work.
You must run away.</i>

559
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:45,456
<i>I'll stop Ameyuri Ringo here.</i>

560
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,627
<i>You can't in your condition!</i>

561
00:43:50,289 --> 00:43:52,916
<i>And besides, there's no
running away from her, right?!</i>

562
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:00,554
<i>Stop... Omoi...</i>

563
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:04,576
Omoi!

564
00:44:06,909 --> 00:44:08,369
Kakashi! Guy!

565
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,901
We made it in time.

566
00:44:14,754 --> 00:44:15,755
Pull him out.

567
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:25,746
Weren't you going to
come with me?

568
00:44:26,522 --> 00:44:29,149
Sorry, maybe another time.

569
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:34,344
In my next life, I'll remember
to eat what I like first.

570
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:37,549
You won't be
reincarnated anymore.

571
00:44:38,117 --> 00:44:39,369
Here's a farewell gift from me...

572
00:44:41,495 --> 00:44:42,496
Thank you.

573
00:44:44,412 --> 00:44:47,457
Omoi... My name's Omoi.

574
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:48,851
Omoi...

575
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,360
That's a thank-you gift from me.

576
00:44:57,986 --> 00:44:59,613
I'll be waiting for you
on the other side.

577
00:45:02,212 --> 00:45:05,632
You did well, Omoi.
You're a hero.

578
00:45:06,734 --> 00:45:08,736
The real hero... is you.

579
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:15,963
So there are new heroes,
after all.

580
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:18,601
It's always a heartwarming sight...

581
00:45:18,626 --> 00:45:20,670
This deep bond between men.

582
00:45:21,548 --> 00:45:23,383
<i>Kakashi, Guy... Listen up.</i>

583
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,931
<i>I wanted to give you a heads-up.</i>

584
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,017
<i>Naruto and Bee are heading
to the battlefront.</i>

585
00:45:29,616 --> 00:45:32,744
<i>It seems nothing worked
to convince Naruto.</i>

586
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:36,650
<i>So, we're going to use
this opportunity to turn this war around!</i>

587
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:38,026
<i>Over and out!</i>

588
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:42,406
Did you hear that, Kakashi?

589
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,493
Yeah... They're finally on the move.

590
00:45:47,292 --> 00:45:50,086
The heroes we've waited
so long for.

591
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,922
No one is allowed near
Lady Shizune's tent!

592
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:02,050
Anyone making a move will
be considered an enemy!

593
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,635
So, just stay put!

594
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:07,931
Sakura, take a look at
this genetic sequence data!

595
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,475
It's finally done?!

596
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,187
It has changed and become
even more like Captain Yamato's

597
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:14,855
than it was at
the Five Kage Summit!

598
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,273
In other words,

599
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:20,319
there's very little difference from
the First Hokage's genetic data.

600
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,988
So it was true.

601
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,323
What are you saying?!

602
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:27,951
What's this about the white creature
and the First Hokage?

603
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:32,456
Essentially, this white creature is
a clone of the First Hokage.

604
00:46:32,745 --> 00:46:35,206
Or rather, judging from
how many there are,

605
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:37,878
the First Hokage's cells
were cultivated and

606
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,132
using living plants as a medium,
mobile clones were created.

607
00:46:42,597 --> 00:46:44,974
They are diluted in strength,
but they still use the Wood Style.

608
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:48,096
Looking at this data,
I'm sure Captain Yamato

609
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:51,058
is being used to make
these clones stronger.

610
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:53,018
I'll notify HQ immediately!

611
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:56,730
I'm back!

612
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:59,066
I got word that those white beings
are transforming,

613
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:01,109
and are causing havoc
on the battlefield.

614
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:03,028
Perhaps it's too much
of a coincidence,

615
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,738
but letting Naruto go
couldn't have been timed better.

616
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,781
I agree.

617
00:47:06,263 --> 00:47:07,431
Sorry to interrupt,

618
00:47:07,456 --> 00:47:09,833
but we just got a report
from the medical team.

619
00:47:09,858 --> 00:47:11,423
It's data about those white creatures.

620
00:47:11,577 --> 00:47:12,662
Give it to me!

621
00:47:15,012 --> 00:47:17,443
Who would have thought that
Madara and Orochimaru's fixation

622
00:47:18,139 --> 00:47:20,254
on the First Hokage
would create this?

623
00:47:21,033 --> 00:47:24,077
Plant clones created
from Grandfather's body.

624
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:27,553
This is proof that

625
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:29,596
Madara has possession of
the First Hokage's cells!

626
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,088
He's cultivated them

627
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,851
and developed a way
to replicate them.

628
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:35,352
Including his own body.

629
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:38,313
No wonder he's been
able to live this long.

630
00:47:38,823 --> 00:47:42,118
Well? Do we have an idea
of how to destroy him?

631
00:47:42,799 --> 00:47:44,133
No... Just the opposite...

632
00:47:44,721 --> 00:47:46,973
Now, we don't even know
what will kill him.

633
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:50,886
It seems Madara is really... immortal!

634
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:59,006
An immortal leader and
his mobile plants...

635
00:47:59,031 --> 00:48:00,908
Reanimation zombies...

636
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:04,506
Not a normal human among them.

637
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:07,112
The white creatures are using
Transformation Justu...

638
00:48:07,366 --> 00:48:09,284
Warn Naruto and Bee immediately!

639
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,852
<i>Naruto, please listen carefully.
You too, Lord Bee.</i>

640
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:22,859
<i>I am transmitting this message
directly into your minds.</i>

641
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:26,987
<i>Let me explain the enemy's battle jutsu
and their objective.</i>

642
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:28,529
<i>Pay close attention.</i>

643
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:36,788
That explains all the weird,
fuzzy sensations I've been having.

644
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:39,958
I guess I have no choice,
but to step up.

645
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:41,752
<i>Yeah!</i>

646
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:45,381
<i>But remember, I mentioned
that Madara's Project Tsuki no Me</i>

647
00:48:45,575 --> 00:48:47,953
<i>won't work without
your Tailed Beasts...</i>

648
00:48:48,588 --> 00:48:51,632
<i>That means you two are his targets.</i>

649
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,014
<i>I know that!</i>

650
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,475
<i>As if I'd sit still and
let them capture me!</i>

651
00:48:56,733 --> 00:49:00,929
<i>Then this time, don't even think
about negotiating with him, Naruto.</i>

652
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:04,066
<i>Madara is different from
Pain and Nagato.</i>

653
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:06,109
<i>He has no interest in peace.</i>

654
00:49:06,501 --> 00:49:10,033
<i>He's a truly evil man
who covets the entire world.</i>

655
00:49:10,394 --> 00:49:12,354
And with Project Tsuki no Me,

656
00:49:12,379 --> 00:49:16,049
he'll be able to completely control
humans through genjutsu...

657
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:20,082
<i>That's about it.
So don't let down your guard!</i>

658
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:25,087
I once talked to Madara
in the Land of Iron.

659
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,839
He told me about
the Uchiha Clan's destiny.

660
00:49:28,317 --> 00:49:32,363
He knows all about hatred,
and took advantage of Nagato.

661
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:34,521
He's the one fueling
Sasuke's hatred too.

662
00:49:35,246 --> 00:49:36,873
I know how evil he is.

663
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:42,646
<i>He doesn't act out of hatred.
He simply exploits hatred.</i>

664
00:49:43,106 --> 00:49:46,359
<i>He's unlike any other foe
you've faced, so be careful!</i>

665
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:49,602
In any case, I'm going to
pulverize Madara

666
00:49:49,627 --> 00:49:51,295
and bring this war to an end!

667
00:49:51,808 --> 00:49:53,820
Only then can we talk.

668
00:49:54,435 --> 00:49:55,978
<i>I don't know about Kabuto,</i>

669
00:49:56,109 --> 00:49:57,861
<i>but Madara is supposedly immortal.</i>

670
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:01,748
<i>Furthermore, those mobile plants
that were restructured</i>

671
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,291
<i>with the First Hokage's cells...</i>

672
00:50:03,602 --> 00:50:05,729
<i>You know,
those otherworldly zombies...</i>

673
00:50:06,242 --> 00:50:07,993
<i>Nothing works against them
except by sealing.</i>

674
00:50:08,222 --> 00:50:10,098
<i>It's truly an undead army.</i>

675
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:12,467
<i>Beware of them too!</i>

676
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:15,470
That's the only piece of
good news.

677
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:17,681
I don't have to worry
about holding back!

678
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:20,350
That's...

679
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:23,103
It's chaos out there
in the battlefield!

680
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:26,231
We've got to get back and
shore up HQ's defense!

681
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,567
<i>Rasengan!</i>

682
00:50:29,142 --> 00:50:30,143
Naruto?!

683
00:50:40,126 --> 00:50:42,639
Leave it all to Naruto here.

684
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:45,834
Those he gives his stamp of approval.
Are the only ones I'll give an ear.

685
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,462
They're all enemies!

686
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,553
Let's do this, Octopops!

687
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,349
<i>Rasenrangan!</i>

688
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,819
<i>Rasenkyugan!</i>

689
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:22,287
<i>Naruto's attack is affecting
the Wood Style,</i>

690
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:23,914
<i>and turning them back into wood?</i>

691
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:29,419
<i>It's just like before...</i>

692
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:47,938
This way, we won't be so vulnerable
to the effects of his attack.

693
00:51:50,959 --> 00:51:52,543
<i>Mini-Rasen Shuriken...</i>

694
00:51:58,799 --> 00:52:01,677
<i>Summoning, Mayhem Jutsu!</i>

695
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,499
All right!

696
00:52:07,613 --> 00:52:09,031
Yay!

697
00:52:09,642 --> 00:52:12,193
The fruits of training.
Thanks to my mentoring.

698
00:52:12,218 --> 00:52:13,303
Yay...

699
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:16,846
I'll leave my Shadow Clones and
Mr. Gamahiro to keep an eye here.

700
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:19,094
Let's go!

701
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:22,889
I'm going to hit all the battlefields
at the same time!

702
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,517
<i>Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

703
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:34,067
It's no good. He caught up to us!

704
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:36,194
H-He's...?!

705
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:40,448
He's a Cloud ninja with
a Kekkei Genkai!

706
00:52:40,916 --> 00:52:42,918
Toroi of the Magnet Style!

707
00:52:43,536 --> 00:52:46,206
The Hidden Cloud has
a Magnet Style user too?

708
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:49,167
When he attacks, you must always...

709
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:55,255
You Idiot! I said you always
have to dodge it!

710
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,073
Huh? You didn't say that!

711
00:52:57,424 --> 00:53:01,887
His Magnet Style magnetizes
any object that he touches.

712
00:53:02,744 --> 00:53:07,332
And subsequently, anything those
things touch becomes magnetized...

713
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,352
although the effect is not
as strong.

714
00:53:09,776 --> 00:53:11,652
You are the first conductor
to have touched the shuriken,

715
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:13,857
so the magnetic power
in your body is...

716
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:16,109
Huh? What exactly do you mean?

717
00:53:16,734 --> 00:53:19,570
Right now, your body is infused
with magnetic power

718
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:22,282
since his shuriken is magnetic.

719
00:53:22,901 --> 00:53:25,195
Which means,
your body and his shuriken

720
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:26,870
are going to be
drawn to each other.

721
00:53:28,412 --> 00:53:30,098
Which means, in his second attack,

722
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:31,875
you won't be able to dodge it!

723
00:53:35,001 --> 00:53:37,295
That means I'm going to die!

724
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:42,093
I'm going to die!

725
00:53:43,083 --> 00:53:44,292
<i>Rasengan!</i>

726
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:51,228
What is all this ruckus?

727
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:56,191
Lord Bee!
What are you doing here?

728
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:58,526
Are you okay?

729
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:00,612
You shouldn't be here!

730
00:54:01,045 --> 00:54:03,548
Those white beings are disguising
themselves as our comrades.

731
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:04,699
I know that.

732
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:07,118
<i>So this is one of the zombies</i>

733
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,663
<i>controlled by
the Reanimation Jutsu...</i>

734
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:11,539
<i>Looks like sealing them like this</i>

735
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,250
<i>is the only way to stop them.</i>

736
00:54:14,281 --> 00:54:16,533
We were rushing back to
Headquarters with Eff

737
00:54:16,558 --> 00:54:18,810
to tighten the security there,
but got separated...

738
00:54:19,473 --> 00:54:21,893
Eff was actually a white creature.

739
00:54:22,397 --> 00:54:23,398
Huh?!

740
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:26,429
Things here have gone awry.

741
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:31,601
Octopops, we have to catch up
with everyone else.

742
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:32,498
Yeah!

743
00:54:43,604 --> 00:54:44,897
Hang on!

744
00:54:45,029 --> 00:54:46,489
Bring me a hemostat! Quickly.

745
00:54:46,579 --> 00:54:47,333
Sakura...

746
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:53,039
Yugao, take her away.

747
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:55,375
All right.

748
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:03,647
I've compiled a preliminary report on
the status of each company.

749
00:55:04,564 --> 00:55:07,137
Casualties spiked up during the night.

750
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:11,182
I hesitate to bring this up, but...

751
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:14,060
The bodies of the shinobi are
full of secret information.

752
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:15,729
If those bodies get into
the hands of the enemy,

753
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:17,147
DNA data could be taken...

754
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:19,065
In a worst-case scenario,

755
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:21,676
the enemy will use their jutsu to
turn them into military weapons.

756
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:23,342
There's no need to worry
about that!

757
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:25,196
I've taken care of it.

758
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:29,014
But there are many corpses
on the battlefield

759
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:30,707
that cannot be recovered...

760
00:55:32,869 --> 00:55:35,663
These three are the bodies
of elite shinobi. I'm certain.

761
00:55:36,091 --> 00:55:38,051
Then I'll place them into
safekeeping immediately.

762
00:55:38,572 --> 00:55:39,753
Thank you.

763
00:55:40,835 --> 00:55:43,004
This one too. He's an elite.

764
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:46,676
All right.
Please line him up over there.

765
00:55:47,036 --> 00:55:48,037
All right.

766
00:55:49,278 --> 00:55:52,349
The ones with Kekkei Genkai
and their relatives,

767
00:55:52,524 --> 00:55:55,160
and those families with
special ninjutsu abilities,

768
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:58,980
are being given the highest priority
in handling and safekeeping.

769
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:01,116
When everything is over,

770
00:56:01,202 --> 00:56:04,873
we'll send them back to their villages
with the rest of the deceased.

771
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:17,281
I'll be returning.

772
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:19,125
Thank you very much.

773
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:27,967
She's very skillful and efficient.

774
00:56:28,167 --> 00:56:31,872
Well, word is that Miss Yugao used
to belong to the ANBU Black Ops.

775
00:56:32,163 --> 00:56:34,748
A former ANBU?
Why's someone like that here?

776
00:56:34,951 --> 00:56:37,495
I don't know. But it helps.

777
00:56:41,663 --> 00:56:43,332
May I ask you a question?

778
00:56:43,486 --> 00:56:45,363
I'm just a little curious...

779
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:47,946
If it's a simple question.

780
00:56:48,649 --> 00:56:51,027
I understand you were once
a member of the ANBU Black Ops.

781
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:56,246
With such skill, what are you
doing helping in the medical camp?

782
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:01,626
Every company is shorthanded now.

783
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:03,336
Someone like you...

784
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:06,756
I... I can't fight anymore.

785
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:10,677
Yugao...

786
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,137
I'll be right there!

787
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:14,180
Please wait.

788
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,516
Right now,
this work is what's best for me.

789
00:57:17,031 --> 00:57:18,228
You should return to
your station quickly too—

790
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:20,770
What was that?!

791
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:22,730
That explosion...
It was from the vault!

792
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:35,869
That man is...

793
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:37,787
Hayate?!

794
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:45,670
Yugao!

795
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:51,509
The scroll he has is the KIA list!

796
00:57:53,378 --> 00:57:54,937
The bodies of the elite shinobi
have been taken!

797
00:57:54,962 --> 00:57:55,963
Get them back!

798
00:57:56,097 --> 00:57:57,098
– Right!
– Right!

799
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,030
Do not flinch!

800
00:58:16,433 --> 00:58:17,684
Not!

801
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:28,129
Get a taste of this!

802
00:58:35,028 --> 00:58:36,529
This is fun!

803
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:38,431
That's enough. Let's go!

804
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:51,361
Where's Shizune?

805
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:53,905
She just went into surgery.

806
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:55,406
All right.

807
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:57,408
Notify HQ about this immediately.

808
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:59,744
And get the wounded inside the tent!

809
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,079
Right!

810
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:03,957
As for the scrolls
with the bodies of the elite...

811
00:59:04,277 --> 00:59:06,028
I saw the faces of the assailants.

812
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:08,019
I believe one of them

813
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:11,214
was a Hidden Leaf Special Jonin...
Hayate Gekko.

814
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:12,590
I see...

815
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:15,009
This medical tent
must be guarded too.

816
00:59:15,279 --> 00:59:18,199
Looking at the situation,
we can't spare many people.

817
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:22,433
We'll have to contact HQ
and ask them to send reinforcements.

818
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:25,061
But Iou, Yokaze, will you two go?

819
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:26,354
– Yes.
– Yes.

820
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:28,314
I'll go too.

821
00:59:28,492 --> 00:59:30,441
My battle and healing skills
will increase

822
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:32,443
the odds of success for this mission.

823
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:36,406
Thanks. Also, Yugao...
I want you to go too.

824
00:59:36,738 --> 00:59:37,739
Huh?!

825
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:40,493
I know that you are not part
of the combat force.

826
00:59:40,722 --> 00:59:43,179
But a Sensory-type is essential
in order to track the enemy.

827
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:44,289
You're the only one available now—

828
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:46,416
That's impossible! I can't...

829
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:48,084
Yugao?

830
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:50,420
This is an emergency.
State your reason!

831
00:59:53,782 --> 00:59:54,715
That man...

832
00:59:55,868 --> 00:59:57,256
Hayate Gekko...

833
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:00,930
was my lover.

834
01:00:08,229 --> 01:00:09,272
You've improved.

835
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:12,066
Not bad, huh?

836
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:14,360
I can get one out of two now.

837
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:18,037
Get real. It's more like
one out of three.

838
01:00:19,923 --> 01:00:21,967
That's because
you can use the Transparency Style.

839
01:00:22,469 --> 01:00:24,856
But just you wait,
I'll catch up in no time.

840
01:00:24,881 --> 01:00:27,634
Then I just have to
work harder so you can't.

841
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:29,204
You're wide open!

842
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:37,342
My mistake.

843
01:00:37,768 --> 01:00:39,311
I won't let you
surpass me that easily.

844
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:43,014
Since I'm going to protect you.

845
01:00:49,394 --> 01:00:51,437
Okay, before the fighting starts...

846
01:00:52,101 --> 01:00:54,144
We should know about
who we're fighting.

847
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:59,197
Hayate Gekko is an expert
in the Hidden Leaf Sword Style.

848
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:01,115
He specializes in
the Transparency Jutsu.

849
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:03,159
He's highly skilled.

850
01:01:03,533 --> 01:01:05,701
You want to avoid close combat.

851
01:01:06,316 --> 01:01:07,147
Let's hurry!

852
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:14,379
That was boring.
I wanted to do more damage.

853
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:17,465
Are you kidding?
I'm sick of being used like this.

854
01:01:17,925 --> 01:01:19,782
But we got to come back to life.

855
01:01:19,807 --> 01:01:21,851
We should enjoy ourselves, right?

856
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:26,683
<i>To meet again like this...</i>

857
01:01:28,329 --> 01:01:29,497
<i>But you could...</i>

858
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:33,940
Hey, I'm talking to you.
Are you dissing me, you bastard?!

859
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:35,650
They're coming.

860
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:44,320
Oh, I see...

861
01:01:44,345 --> 01:01:46,431
This is what it means to
have a body that can't die.

862
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:48,125
This is pretty convenient.

863
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:49,360
Don't talk too soon!

864
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:57,849
A posse, eh?

865
01:01:58,175 --> 01:01:59,510
That's more like it!

866
01:02:00,863 --> 01:02:02,234
Two left...

867
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:05,179
I wish we could have stopped
at least one more.

868
01:02:06,243 --> 01:02:08,314
That one disappeared quick...

869
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:10,560
This is perfect though.

870
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,603
Let's share the prey, fifty-fifty!

871
01:02:12,787 --> 01:02:14,330
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

872
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:17,942
Please take care of that one!

873
01:02:18,192 --> 01:02:18,966
Right!

874
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:21,655
You've come...

875
01:02:24,133 --> 01:02:25,217
Get back.

876
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:28,703
Sorry, but you'll be going up
against me!

877
01:02:30,266 --> 01:02:32,018
<i>Earth Style: Flying Stones!</i>

878
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:38,296
You're mine!

879
01:02:42,205 --> 01:02:43,748
Please get back.

880
01:02:44,385 --> 01:02:47,096
Then return that scroll!

881
01:02:55,252 --> 01:02:56,253
What?!

882
01:03:04,056 --> 01:03:04,765
Iou!

883
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:06,751
You should pay attention!

884
01:03:07,366 --> 01:03:09,619
Go after him too.

885
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:20,255
I'm sorry.

886
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:24,509
I am now an enemy of the Leaf...
and yours as well.

887
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:28,513
So I want you to stop me.

888
01:03:33,048 --> 01:03:35,717
I don't want to hurt you... Please!

889
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:40,513
Yugao! Take this!

890
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:46,322
Kill me, Yugao!

891
01:03:57,458 --> 01:03:58,501
I can't...

892
01:03:59,735 --> 01:04:00,820
I just can't!

893
01:04:03,855 --> 01:04:05,065
If you don't...

894
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:10,180
Yugao!

895
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:18,688
Cha!

896
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:22,120
That's all you got?

897
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:32,994
You're the only one left.

898
01:04:34,519 --> 01:04:35,520
I have to go.

899
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:38,330
Wait!

900
01:04:38,355 --> 01:04:39,607
Damn it!

901
01:04:43,939 --> 01:04:44,940
Iou!

902
01:04:48,477 --> 01:04:49,686
This is...!

903
01:04:56,475 --> 01:04:59,103
Please bear with the pain.
I'm going to close the wound.

904
01:05:01,069 --> 01:05:04,113
Iou can't continue on with the pursuit.

905
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:06,527
That goes for you too...

906
01:05:08,096 --> 01:05:10,098
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

907
01:05:10,741 --> 01:05:11,742
No.

908
01:05:12,099 --> 01:05:14,059
But it was true then?

909
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:17,914
That... you can't fight.

910
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:21,083
I'm sorry.

911
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:25,062
I always dreamed of joining
the ANBU Black Ops,

912
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:26,505
so I lost my head earlier...

913
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:29,216
I'm going to get some water.

914
01:05:46,159 --> 01:05:47,452
Where are you going?

915
01:05:49,676 --> 01:05:51,928
Hayate hasn't changed his course.

916
01:05:52,550 --> 01:05:55,345
So you don't need my help
in pursuing him.

917
01:05:55,844 --> 01:05:58,347
There's nothing I can do
even if I remained.

918
01:06:02,781 --> 01:06:05,451
Why did you leave
the ANBU Black Ops?

919
01:06:08,589 --> 01:06:10,758
Hayate was my lover.

920
01:06:12,716 --> 01:06:17,680
At the time, we were training partners
in the Leaf Sword Style.

921
01:06:18,265 --> 01:06:21,477
We honed our skills together.

922
01:06:28,281 --> 01:06:29,282
There!

923
01:06:31,562 --> 01:06:32,604
Impressive.

924
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:36,617
The Hokage himself certified
my Transparency Style.

925
01:06:37,170 --> 01:06:41,731
Well, with my Sensory skills and
swordsmanship, I was chosen for the ANBU.

926
01:06:45,985 --> 01:06:47,432
But you're still lacking.

927
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:49,279
I'm almost there!

928
01:06:54,534 --> 01:06:55,418
Hayate?

929
01:06:56,485 --> 01:06:59,279
I suppose I should be happy

930
01:06:59,438 --> 01:07:01,440
that your strength has
been acknowledged.

931
01:07:02,405 --> 01:07:05,325
But the missions are risky,
far more dangerous than before.

932
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:08,733
Please, I want you to be careful.

933
01:07:15,939 --> 01:07:17,399
I heard that...

934
01:07:17,424 --> 01:07:19,134
members of the ANBU Black Ops
died at Hidden Leaf Hospital...!

935
01:07:19,243 --> 01:07:21,537
I'll be fine. But...

936
01:07:23,492 --> 01:07:25,369
They were killed by Kabuto Yakushi.

937
01:07:26,053 --> 01:07:28,973
It seems he was Orochimaru's spy.

938
01:07:29,443 --> 01:07:31,946
The one who was taking part
in the Chunin Exam?

939
01:07:32,387 --> 01:07:34,097
He had us completely fooled.

940
01:07:34,612 --> 01:07:40,702
But going after Sasuke
doesn't explain their actions.

941
01:07:41,355 --> 01:07:44,775
Without a doubt,
they're up to no good.

942
01:07:46,086 --> 01:07:51,467
So we must learn more
about their movements.

943
01:07:56,954 --> 01:07:58,246
It's too dangerous.

944
01:07:59,230 --> 01:08:01,983
He held his own against Kakashi.

945
01:08:03,204 --> 01:08:04,747
But someone has to go.

946
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:08,459
And with my Tracking Jutsu,
I'm the ideal candidate.

947
01:08:09,543 --> 01:08:10,544
But...

948
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:13,422
I'm off.

949
01:08:25,142 --> 01:08:27,853
Hayate Gekko has been killed.

950
01:08:28,234 --> 01:08:29,694
– What?!
– Oh no...

951
01:08:34,551 --> 01:08:35,314
<i>No...</i>

952
01:08:37,170 --> 01:08:38,296
Not Hayate?

953
01:08:39,175 --> 01:08:43,137
He was found on the outskirts
of Kikyo Castle.

954
01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:45,333
That's...

955
01:08:50,998 --> 01:08:54,543
<i>The destruction of the Leaf Village
happened a month later...</i>

956
01:09:07,852 --> 01:09:10,938
Hayate, I'll avenge you.

957
01:09:12,176 --> 01:09:14,845
<i>It was my way of memorializing Hayate...</i>

958
01:09:15,177 --> 01:09:18,097
<i>So I fought and I fought...</i>

959
01:09:18,961 --> 01:09:21,588
<i>But when the fighting ended...</i>

960
01:09:21,782 --> 01:09:24,368
<i>My emotions that had been stretched
so thin... just snapped.</i>

961
01:09:37,883 --> 01:09:40,677
<i>I couldn't even hold
a sword anymore.</i>

962
01:09:48,914 --> 01:09:52,209
Hayate and I were connected
through fencing.

963
01:09:53,116 --> 01:09:58,246
Inevitably, a sword reminds me
of his death.

964
01:09:58,652 --> 01:10:00,196
Yugao...

965
01:10:00,891 --> 01:10:02,226
How can I kill him?

966
01:10:02,833 --> 01:10:05,669
How can I go through his death
all over again?

967
01:10:07,255 --> 01:10:12,385
Still, I cannot let you go...
and leave behind the injured.

968
01:10:14,473 --> 01:10:15,891
Am I right?

969
01:10:15,916 --> 01:10:19,003
I understand a little of
what you're going through...

970
01:10:19,441 --> 01:10:22,402
I couldn't fight the one I loved.

971
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:26,132
But you must see this through.

972
01:10:27,348 --> 01:10:28,515
Sakura...

973
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:31,852
Kakashi-sensei told us...

974
01:10:32,174 --> 01:10:33,633
"This jutsu is unforgivable."

975
01:10:34,486 --> 01:10:37,572
To trample on a person's death...
to trample on our memories of them...

976
01:10:38,192 --> 01:10:39,568
I feel the same way!

977
01:10:48,849 --> 01:10:52,185
I'll be fine. Our reinforcements
will be here shortly.

978
01:11:10,648 --> 01:11:12,776
Please stop, Hayate Gekko.

979
01:11:13,993 --> 01:11:16,829
You're... Sakura Haruno, right?

980
01:11:19,705 --> 01:11:22,207
You've become a fine shinobi.

981
01:11:23,668 --> 01:11:25,378
I don't want to kill you.

982
01:11:25,739 --> 01:11:27,199
And I can't let you go.

983
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:29,451
I can't let you have that scroll!

984
01:11:46,051 --> 01:11:48,053
I won't get into your line of attack!

985
01:11:52,252 --> 01:11:53,295
Right there!

986
01:11:54,994 --> 01:11:55,995
Where'd he go?

987
01:12:00,463 --> 01:12:01,597
Please run away!

988
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:10,301
I'm here.

989
01:12:11,695 --> 01:12:12,930
I'm sorry I'm late.

990
01:12:14,747 --> 01:12:15,748
Thank you.

991
01:12:16,498 --> 01:12:17,624
I'll assist.

992
01:12:18,003 --> 01:12:20,074
No, call the Sealing Corps.

993
01:12:20,815 --> 01:12:23,150
Killing him won't stop him.

994
01:12:26,912 --> 01:12:27,576
Right!

995
01:12:30,781 --> 01:12:33,116
– <i>Dance of the Crescent Moon!</i>
– <i>Dance of the Crescent Moon!</i>

996
01:12:57,498 --> 01:12:58,874
Yugao...

997
01:13:00,618 --> 01:13:01,619
Hayate...

998
01:13:04,958 --> 01:13:06,459
<i>Moonlit Night...</i>

999
01:13:10,123 --> 01:13:11,374
<i>Secret Sword: Tsukikage!</i>

1000
01:13:21,742 --> 01:13:24,120
Like you said, you've gotten better.

1001
01:13:26,213 --> 01:13:27,673
It wasn't for something like this.

1002
01:13:28,946 --> 01:13:30,087
I regret...

1003
01:13:30,871 --> 01:13:33,165
making that promise.

1004
01:13:35,435 --> 01:13:36,644
You're wrong.

1005
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,707
I wondered what was taking
so long.

1006
01:13:41,354 --> 01:13:43,874
Hurry up and do your work,
will you?

1007
01:13:47,595 --> 01:13:48,805
I'm being called...

1008
01:13:49,542 --> 01:13:51,502
Is he taking my consciousness too?!

1009
01:14:06,097 --> 01:14:07,556
Hayate...

1010
01:14:10,028 --> 01:14:11,530
This is pitiful, but...

1011
01:14:12,354 --> 01:14:14,315
I'm really doing my best.

1012
01:14:15,064 --> 01:14:16,232
Yugao!

1013
01:14:19,788 --> 01:14:22,624
Goodbye, Yugao.

1014
01:14:39,377 --> 01:14:41,963
Yokaze and Iou
have been rescued.

1015
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:43,896
I see. That's good.

1016
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:46,440
Yugao...

1017
01:14:46,857 --> 01:14:48,400
In the end...

1018
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:50,652
he protected me.

1019
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:55,782
Thank you... and...

1020
01:14:56,027 --> 01:14:57,737
goodbye...

1021
01:14:58,702 --> 01:15:00,204
Hayate.

1022
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:15,844
You don't think it's...

1023
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:17,054
Are they close?

1024
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:20,557
It feels familiar, nostalgic...

1025
01:15:24,229 --> 01:15:26,148
Itachi Uchiha... and Nagato!

1026
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:28,023
You know these guys, Naruto?

1027
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:29,868
Yeah, I know both of them.

1028
01:15:30,497 --> 01:15:35,877
I never imagined I'd be forced
into fighting you again, Naruto.

1029
01:15:36,958 --> 01:15:39,461
It's probably been
a while since we last met.

1030
01:15:39,747 --> 01:15:42,249
But since I've been dead, it feels
like it's only been a moment.

1031
01:15:43,436 --> 01:15:45,355
You've changed a bit, Naruto.

1032
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:47,272
Oh, you mean this?

1033
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:51,050
I've mastered the Nine-Tails' chakra now.

1034
01:15:51,075 --> 01:15:52,827
This is my Chakra Mode!

1035
01:15:53,823 --> 01:15:54,642
What?

1036
01:15:54,899 --> 01:15:58,402
I see...
No wonder you look different.

1037
01:15:59,065 --> 01:16:00,316
It's your face.

1038
01:16:03,517 --> 01:16:06,186
You now command
the power of the Nine-Tails?

1039
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:08,647
I'm impressed with your development!

1040
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:11,419
He and I are fellow disciples.

1041
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,360
I'm not surprised!

1042
01:16:14,007 --> 01:16:15,236
For that, it's me he owes...

1043
01:16:15,261 --> 01:16:17,847
Before I came along, he was
pretty much in the shadows.

1044
01:16:17,872 --> 01:16:19,707
That's so not true!

1045
01:16:20,992 --> 01:16:24,996
So you've overcome hatred, Naruto?

1046
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:28,947
Oh yeah! As my senior,
you taught me about pain.

1047
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:32,504
The training I did at the Waterfall
of Truth with Octopops...

1048
01:16:32,629 --> 01:16:33,839
My mom and dad...

1049
01:16:34,548 --> 01:16:37,759
I have all of you to thank
for where I am now!

1050
01:16:38,885 --> 01:16:39,928
I see...

1051
01:16:41,154 --> 01:16:43,949
Naruto, I must ask you...

1052
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:47,298
That reminds me—

1053
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:49,521
I have a question for you,
as well.

1054
01:16:52,208 --> 01:16:57,505
<i>Seems like I found you first...
Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails.</i>

1055
01:16:57,904 --> 01:17:02,366
<i>With these two cards,
he'll fall right into my hands.</i>

1056
01:17:04,304 --> 01:17:07,015
<i>Too bad I won't be able to see
the frustrated look on</i>

1057
01:17:07,138 --> 01:17:10,141
<i>his face under that mask...
when he realizes!</i>

1058
01:17:18,972 --> 01:17:19,594
Yo?!

1059
01:17:28,494 --> 01:17:30,037
Oops, was that hot?

1060
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:31,438
Sorry for not giving it all I got.

1061
01:17:31,855 --> 01:17:32,981
Samehada...

1062
01:17:34,024 --> 01:17:35,525
<i>So Kisame is dead...</i>

1063
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:39,404
He was still talking...

1064
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:42,324
He's under a spell...

1065
01:17:42,866 --> 01:17:44,785
Even if he cuts you off,
what the hell?

1066
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:46,203
Okay?

1067
01:17:47,746 --> 01:17:48,580
Above you!

1068
01:17:48,725 --> 01:17:49,486
I see him!

1069
01:17:52,626 --> 01:17:53,794
What happened to Sasuke?

1070
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:57,464
He says he's going to take
revenge on the Leaf Village!

1071
01:17:58,173 --> 01:18:00,384
He joined the Akatsuki!

1072
01:18:01,551 --> 01:18:03,470
Why won't Sasuke return
to the village?

1073
01:18:05,764 --> 01:18:08,433
He found out about
your top-secret mission,

1074
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:13,355
and chose to destroy the village!

1075
01:18:16,233 --> 01:18:17,359
Top-secret mission?

1076
01:18:17,442 --> 01:18:18,860
Don't tell me Madara...?

1077
01:18:28,578 --> 01:18:32,499
Madara told me the truth too.

1078
01:18:35,001 --> 01:18:36,545
So that's how it was...

1079
01:18:37,295 --> 01:18:40,632
So Madara was telling the truth!

1080
01:18:41,472 --> 01:18:44,058
The Uchiha Clan tried to
take over the village and...

1081
01:18:44,083 --> 01:18:46,211
You've said enough, Naruto.

1082
01:18:47,380 --> 01:18:48,798
Is that true, Itachi?

1083
01:18:49,519 --> 01:18:50,284
Itachi...

1084
01:18:50,992 --> 01:18:55,355
You died playing the villain in order
to protect the village and Sasuke!

1085
01:18:55,981 --> 01:18:59,901
Sasuke surely understands
your pain and resolve!

1086
01:19:01,561 --> 01:19:04,297
But instead of seeing
your wishes through,

1087
01:19:04,322 --> 01:19:05,866
Sasuke is trying to
destroy the village.

1088
01:19:06,513 --> 01:19:08,552
This is his way of avenging

1089
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:11,747
the pain the village caused
his beloved older brother!

1090
01:19:13,815 --> 01:19:17,819
<i>Damn Madara,
he knew the truth about me...</i>

1091
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,643
Do the villagers know about this?

1092
01:19:23,508 --> 01:19:26,511
Kakashi-sensei and
Captain Yamato were there too.

1093
01:19:27,304 --> 01:19:30,432
But there was nothing to prove
what Madara said,

1094
01:19:30,555 --> 01:19:32,557
so Kakashi-sensei is keeping
everyone tight-lipped.

1095
01:19:32,876 --> 01:19:34,920
I don't think anyone else knows.

1096
01:19:35,803 --> 01:19:39,056
Then don't ever tell
the village about this!

1097
01:19:39,733 --> 01:19:42,652
You can't let the Uchiha Clan's
reputation change!

1098
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:44,571
And one more thing...

1099
01:19:45,572 --> 01:19:47,491
<i>Damn! My body is moving
on its own!</i>

1100
01:19:48,116 --> 01:19:49,364
<i>Universal Pull!</i>

1101
01:20:01,605 --> 01:20:03,238
Nicely dodged, Naruto!

1102
01:20:03,647 --> 01:20:06,691
I'm stronger now than
when Pain and I fought.

1103
01:20:14,436 --> 01:20:16,271
I'll let you deal with Sasuke.

1104
01:20:16,816 --> 01:20:18,396
That was my plan from the start!

1105
01:20:20,273 --> 01:20:22,567
Entrusting it to you was
the right thing to do, after all.

1106
01:20:24,893 --> 01:20:27,520
Okay, Naruto, pull me away!

1107
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:29,449
I can't move by myself.

1108
01:20:32,202 --> 01:20:33,453
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

1109
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:34,496
What?!

1110
01:20:41,628 --> 01:20:43,046
Or maybe I can...

1111
01:20:43,353 --> 01:20:45,660
Since when can you do that?!

1112
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:47,525
Behind you!

1113
01:20:47,717 --> 01:20:49,427
I got it! Okay!

1114
01:20:50,486 --> 01:20:52,362
<i>Fire Style: Phoenix Flower jutsu!</i>

1115
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:01,940
Hot! Hot! Hot!

1116
01:21:07,487 --> 01:21:10,240
Caught you! Ya fool, ya fool!

1117
01:21:13,493 --> 01:21:16,580
For someone so big,
that was easy!

1118
01:21:17,247 --> 01:21:18,915
Keep your guard up, Naruto!

1119
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,128
What the hell's happening?!

1120
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:32,554
<i>Genjutsu!</i>

1121
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:36,182
Don't look at my eyes!

1122
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:41,980
Ouch!

1123
01:21:42,272 --> 01:21:43,565
<i>Wake up!</i>

1124
01:21:47,252 --> 01:21:48,337
Samehada!

1125
01:21:59,873 --> 01:22:03,126
Killer Bee the Eight-Tails!
That's me!

1126
01:22:03,589 --> 01:22:04,590
Yay!

1127
01:22:26,691 --> 01:22:27,776
This'll go on forever!

1128
01:22:28,325 --> 01:22:29,868
He multiplies every time
you hit him!

1129
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:31,655
Knock me down first!

1130
01:22:41,659 --> 01:22:42,910
Watch yourself, Octopops!

1131
01:22:43,583 --> 01:22:46,294
If you get struck by Amaterasu or
Tsukuyomi, it'll be the end of you!

1132
01:22:46,704 --> 01:22:48,081
He's got the Mangekyo Sharingan!

1133
01:22:56,304 --> 01:22:57,597
It's out.

1134
01:23:05,188 --> 01:23:10,026
<i>You just said you consider
Sasuke to be like a brother...</i>

1135
01:23:10,351 --> 01:23:14,214
<i>What if Sasuke were to attack
the Leaf Village?</i>

1136
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:15,907
<i>What would you do then?</i>

1137
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:18,284
<i>What?
Why would Sasuke...?</i>

1138
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:20,787
<i>There's no way he'd do
something like that!</i>

1139
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:23,790
<i>Sasuke is still naïve.</i>

1140
01:23:24,329 --> 01:23:26,581
<i>He can easily be influenced.</i>

1141
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:31,035
<i>In such a case,
can you stop him?</i>

1142
01:23:33,049 --> 01:23:34,884
<i>Even if you have to kill Sasuke?</i>

1143
01:23:42,785 --> 01:23:45,622
<i>I have shared some of
my power with you.</i>

1144
01:23:45,937 --> 01:23:49,566
<i>Though I hope the day never comes
when you'll have to use it.</i>

1145
01:23:53,527 --> 01:23:54,528
<i>This feeling!</i>

1146
01:23:57,504 --> 01:23:59,423
Naruto! It's Amaterasu!

1147
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:03,175
<i>Almighty Push!</i>

1148
01:24:04,956 --> 01:24:06,958
Damn it! My body's moving
by itself again!

1149
01:24:10,982 --> 01:24:11,983
What was that?!

1150
01:24:12,555 --> 01:24:13,689
What's going on?!

1151
01:24:24,434 --> 01:24:26,144
It's not Amaterasu?

1152
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:35,779
So that's how it is...

1153
01:24:36,996 --> 01:24:38,069
How what is...?

1154
01:24:38,782 --> 01:24:40,366
<i>Amaterasu...</i>

1155
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:56,341
That crow... It's yours, isn't it?

1156
01:24:56,813 --> 01:24:58,732
What did you do with that crow?

1157
01:25:01,888 --> 01:25:03,431
I underestimated him...

1158
01:25:04,222 --> 01:25:05,308
<i>Amaterasu!</i>

1159
01:25:20,025 --> 01:25:20,865
You!

1160
01:25:21,407 --> 01:25:22,867
Relax...

1161
01:25:23,079 --> 01:25:24,929
I'm no longer being controlled.

1162
01:25:25,411 --> 01:25:28,164
I used a new genjutsu against
the enemy's jutsu.

1163
01:25:29,916 --> 01:25:32,919
A genjutsu that orders me
to protect the Leaf Village.

1164
01:25:33,419 --> 01:25:36,005
It erased the Reanimation Jutsu.

1165
01:25:38,408 --> 01:25:43,788
I prepared that crow to respond
to my Mangekyo Sharingan.

1166
01:25:44,806 --> 01:25:46,391
Just in case, for times like this.

1167
01:25:48,101 --> 01:25:49,352
What are you talking about?

1168
01:25:50,211 --> 01:25:52,755
It's implanted in that crow's left eye.

1169
01:25:54,647 --> 01:25:56,115
It's his eye!

1170
01:25:57,300 --> 01:26:00,177
There's only one genjutsu
that can do that.

1171
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:02,615
Shisui Uchiha's...

1172
01:26:03,173 --> 01:26:06,719
The strnogest Mangekyo Sharingan
genjutsu:

1173
01:26:07,370 --> 01:26:08,810
Koto Amatsukami.

1174
01:26:13,084 --> 01:26:15,795
Using that genjutsu,
I was able to restore myself.

1175
01:26:16,559 --> 01:26:19,937
It appears Shisui's Mangekyo
had already worn off, though.

1176
01:26:20,466 --> 01:26:22,468
Shisui Uchiha?

1177
01:26:23,699 --> 01:26:25,785
The Uchiha's most powerful
genjutsu user...

1178
01:26:26,003 --> 01:26:27,768
Shisui of the Body Flicker?

1179
01:26:29,058 --> 01:26:33,062
Shisui's Visual Prowess creates
a powerful genjutsu

1180
01:26:33,104 --> 01:26:37,025
that allows you to control someone
without them ever realizing it.

1181
01:26:38,109 --> 01:26:41,905
I programmed the genjutsu,
to protect the Leaf, into Shisui's eye.

1182
01:26:42,458 --> 01:26:45,252
Then I put it into the crow's left eye,

1183
01:26:45,575 --> 01:26:47,698
and after that,
I implanted the crow in you, Naruto.

1184
01:26:49,185 --> 01:26:52,957
I never realized that I'd be
using it on myself someday.

1185
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:58,087
Why did you have that eye,
and why did you give it to me?

1186
01:27:01,942 --> 01:27:03,048
Self-sacrifice...

1187
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,554
The mark of a true shinobi is
that they do not seek glory.

1188
01:27:06,803 --> 01:27:08,680
They protect from the shadows.

1189
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:11,847
Shisui taught me that.

1190
01:27:13,147 --> 01:27:17,902
Shisui anticipated that a battle
would ensue for his eyes.

1191
01:27:18,335 --> 01:27:21,655
He faked his own death and made
it seem like his eyes were destroyed.

1192
01:27:21,841 --> 01:27:25,469
I helped him by becoming
the target of suspicion in the village.

1193
01:27:26,590 --> 01:27:28,174
When I last saw Shisui,

1194
01:27:28,705 --> 01:27:31,124
Danzo had managed to
steal his right eye.

1195
01:27:32,795 --> 01:27:34,985
He bequeathed his remaining
left eye to me,

1196
01:27:35,010 --> 01:27:38,704
telling me to use it to protect
the village, and disappeared.

1197
01:27:40,171 --> 01:27:44,967
I gave that eye to you,
because you share Shisui's feelings.

1198
01:27:46,803 --> 01:27:50,527
If Sasuke, whom I left behind,
ever became a threat to the village...

1199
01:27:51,035 --> 01:27:54,997
then I would have violated all
that Shisui entrusted me to do.

1200
01:27:56,123 --> 01:27:59,534
You are the only one
who can make it right.

1201
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:03,278
You said you consider
Sasuke a brother.

1202
01:28:03,319 --> 01:28:06,614
That's why I felt that you, Naruto,

1203
01:28:06,974 --> 01:28:08,750
were the only one
who could stop him.

1204
01:28:10,076 --> 01:28:11,744
True power...

1205
01:28:11,786 --> 01:28:13,997
In his quest for
the Eternal Mangekyo,

1206
01:28:14,038 --> 01:28:16,874
Sasuke planned on transplanting
my eyes into himself.

1207
01:28:18,209 --> 01:28:19,752
If that ever happened,

1208
01:28:19,794 --> 01:28:23,715
that crow was supposed
to emerge from you,

1209
01:28:23,756 --> 01:28:26,843
in response to your coming into
contact with my transplanted eyes,

1210
01:28:27,168 --> 01:28:29,799
and cast the Koto Amatsukami on Sasuke,
compelling him to to protect the Leaf.

1211
01:28:29,824 --> 01:28:31,618
That was my plan.

1212
01:28:32,598 --> 01:28:35,101
Why didn't you cast that jutsu
on Sasuke from the start,

1213
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:36,310
using Shisui's eye?

1214
01:28:37,854 --> 01:28:41,649
It's not that I didn't, I couldn't.

1215
01:28:42,192 --> 01:28:43,228
Not at that time...

1216
01:28:44,402 --> 01:28:48,448
Shisui's Mangekyo would take
decades to reactivate,

1217
01:28:48,948 --> 01:28:51,492
unless you had
Hashirama Senju's chakra.

1218
01:28:52,556 --> 01:28:55,476
Also, there were many things

1219
01:28:55,932 --> 01:28:57,957
Sasuke wanted to
use my death for.

1220
01:29:00,084 --> 01:29:01,127
Itachi...

1221
01:29:02,649 --> 01:29:04,192
Thank you for trusting me.

1222
01:29:05,103 --> 01:29:07,212
You don't have to worry anymore.

1223
01:29:07,958 --> 01:29:11,734
You've done more than
enough for the village.

1224
01:29:13,146 --> 01:29:15,315
Let me take care of the rest.

1225
01:29:18,028 --> 01:29:24,868
My little brother is lucky...
to have a friend like you.

1226
01:29:28,717 --> 01:29:30,636
<i>Even Shisui's eye...</i>

1227
01:29:30,907 --> 01:29:33,409
<i>Luck just keeps coming my way!</i>

1228
01:29:34,410 --> 01:29:36,245
<i>Almighty Push!</i>

1229
01:29:46,756 --> 01:29:47,840
Where did he go?!

1230
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:52,674
<i>Almighty Push!</i>

1231
01:30:02,647 --> 01:30:06,109
It isn't going to be that easy.
Fool, ya fool!

1232
01:30:08,666 --> 01:30:10,501
<i>Lariat!</i>

1233
01:30:11,447 --> 01:30:12,698
<i>Gakido!</i>

1234
01:30:24,210 --> 01:30:26,295
Are you absorbing chakra?

1235
01:30:27,470 --> 01:30:29,597
Octopops, you okay?

1236
01:30:39,998 --> 01:30:41,301
<i>Ningendo!</i>

1237
01:30:46,910 --> 01:30:50,247
You have all of Pain's jutsu!

1238
01:30:52,613 --> 01:30:54,532
But I'm... not familiar with this one!

1239
01:30:59,506 --> 01:31:01,466
Oh, right!

1240
01:31:01,491 --> 01:31:04,035
I just confirmed that he can absorb
ninjutsu a minute ago!

1241
01:31:04,060 --> 01:31:05,395
I'm so stupid!

1242
01:31:05,585 --> 01:31:08,087
Nagato! What the hell is
that jutsu anyway?!

1243
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:09,672
Tell me!

1244
01:31:11,924 --> 01:31:13,009
<i>No good!</i>

1245
01:31:13,050 --> 01:31:14,594
<i>He's completely being controlled...</i>

1246
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:16,596
<i>Jigokudo!</i>

1247
01:31:27,473 --> 01:31:28,807
<i>Hey, wait... This is...</i>

1248
01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:31,903
<i>It's the reviver Pain's jutsu!</i>

1249
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:34,906
What are you after?!

1250
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:39,660
<i>Use Ningendo to extract
their souls and kill them.</i>

1251
01:31:39,702 --> 01:31:42,914
<i>Hide their bodies and souls
with Jigokudo...</i>

1252
01:31:43,350 --> 01:31:46,562
<i>and bring them back to me,
so that I can revive them.</i>

1253
01:31:47,579 --> 01:31:53,085
<i>I can make the Jinchuriki mine
without Madara finding out.</i>

1254
01:31:54,943 --> 01:31:58,655
<i>Now then, what else could he do?</i>

1255
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:06,979
Damn it! So you're not going to
give me any answers, after all?!

1256
01:32:07,550 --> 01:32:11,595
How does that reviving jutsu work again?

1257
01:32:14,042 --> 01:32:17,254
This stuff...
It's like my soul's coming out!

1258
01:32:17,646 --> 01:32:18,814
And I'm losing strength...

1259
01:32:19,171 --> 01:32:21,006
I'm getting a bad feeling about this!

1260
01:32:22,873 --> 01:32:23,871
<i>Shurado!</i>

1261
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:40,429
What did he summon? Strange armor?

1262
01:32:40,792 --> 01:32:41,681
Octopops!

1263
01:32:47,614 --> 01:32:50,701
He sure uses a lot of hands.
To change tactics and his stance.

1264
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:58,906
Naruto, remember when you had
that tug-of-war with the Nine-Tails!

1265
01:33:20,970 --> 01:33:22,138
<i>Susano'o!</i>

1266
01:33:29,851 --> 01:33:32,729
You're a lifesaver! Thanks, Itachi!

1267
01:33:32,998 --> 01:33:34,500
What kind of ninja is he?!

1268
01:33:34,658 --> 01:33:39,204
Damn, he's strong! Fool, ya fool!

1269
01:33:39,405 --> 01:33:41,324
He's known as Pain,

1270
01:33:41,365 --> 01:33:43,284
and has the strength of
the Sage of Six Paths.

1271
01:33:43,326 --> 01:33:44,785
So, of course he's strong!

1272
01:33:45,119 --> 01:33:48,581
And this time, we're facing him,
not his corpse puppets!

1273
01:33:48,833 --> 01:33:51,461
So his power and moves are
in a different league.

1274
01:33:52,251 --> 01:33:53,711
<i>Planetary Devastation.</i>

1275
01:33:54,211 --> 01:33:55,043
Here it comes!

1276
01:34:11,854 --> 01:34:13,731
What is that?!

1277
01:34:13,997 --> 01:34:16,913
That black sphere looks like
it has enormous gravitational pull!

1278
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:21,505
He got me with this jutsu once!

1279
01:34:21,530 --> 01:34:23,658
It's really bad, it's really bad!

1280
01:34:23,699 --> 01:34:25,576
If you get caught in it, it's over!

1281
01:34:26,911 --> 01:34:27,995
Hey, Naruto...

1282
01:34:28,037 --> 01:34:29,038
What?!

1283
01:34:29,829 --> 01:34:32,794
If it's a sure death,
how come you're still alive?

1284
01:34:38,923 --> 01:34:41,300
Well then, no need to worry,
about our victory.

1285
01:34:41,342 --> 01:34:43,344
This is no time to be laughing!

1286
01:34:43,489 --> 01:34:46,241
How can you be so easygoing
when we're in a bind like this?!

1287
01:34:47,890 --> 01:34:50,810
If we're caught,
we'll never be able to get out!

1288
01:34:50,851 --> 01:34:52,687
Its gravitational power is awesome!

1289
01:34:53,093 --> 01:34:56,457
I got out only because
of Nine-Tails' rampage...

1290
01:34:56,482 --> 01:34:57,817
It's not about being easygoing.

1291
01:34:58,526 --> 01:35:00,444
Analysis requires calm.

1292
01:35:01,404 --> 01:35:03,864
It's safe to assume that the mass
that Nagato threw earlier

1293
01:35:03,889 --> 01:35:05,724
is the central core of gravity.

1294
01:35:06,826 --> 01:35:08,869
We need to destroy it.

1295
01:35:09,745 --> 01:35:11,706
We'll attack the center simultaneously,

1296
01:35:12,324 --> 01:35:14,679
each of us using our strongest
long-range ninjutsu!

1297
01:35:21,465 --> 01:35:24,885
We can't aim properly under
these conditions!

1298
01:35:25,275 --> 01:35:27,652
Our jutsu will make contact,
even if we don't aim correctly.

1299
01:35:27,888 --> 01:35:32,810
This tactic takes advantage of
the core's powerful gravitational pull.

1300
01:35:34,410 --> 01:35:38,414
Every jutsu has a weakness!

1301
01:35:43,028 --> 01:35:44,029
Okay.

1302
01:35:44,405 --> 01:35:45,406
That was fast!

1303
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:48,993
All right... Me too!

1304
01:35:58,394 --> 01:35:59,729
<i>Yasaka Beads!</i>

1305
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:01,088
<i>Tailed Beast Bomb!</i>

1306
01:36:01,839 --> 01:36:04,800
<i>Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken!</i>

1307
01:36:41,350 --> 01:36:43,644
Forgive me... Itachi.

1308
01:36:44,673 --> 01:36:45,966
You're back.

1309
01:36:47,070 --> 01:36:48,238
This is the Totsuka Blade...

1310
01:36:48,822 --> 01:36:51,044
It's a sword that possesses
a sealing jutsu.

1311
01:36:52,103 --> 01:36:54,021
You will be sealed away soon.

1312
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:56,268
Do you have any last words?

1313
01:37:01,826 --> 01:37:10,118
Naruto, I'm going back to where our
master is to watch your story unfold.

1314
01:37:12,368 --> 01:37:17,331
If you ask me, you are
the final volume of the trilogy.

1315
01:37:18,652 --> 01:37:22,364
Jiraiya was the perfect first volume.

1316
01:37:23,879 --> 01:37:30,010
But the second volume
was a failure... me.

1317
01:37:31,929 --> 01:37:34,723
One that our master
would not acknowledge.

1318
01:37:36,860 --> 01:37:39,738
You must make it
a masterpiece...

1319
01:37:39,763 --> 01:37:43,892
One that will completely overshadow
the failure of the middle volume, Naruto!

1320
01:38:20,603 --> 01:38:21,687
Farewell.

1321
01:38:36,702 --> 01:38:39,455
This Reanimation Jutsu or
whatever they call it stinks!

1322
01:38:40,606 --> 01:38:43,025
Guys are forced to fight,
even when they don't want to.

1323
01:38:43,754 --> 01:38:46,548
This is happening at
other battlegrounds too, right?

1324
01:38:47,866 --> 01:38:49,909
I will put a stop to
the Reanimation Jutsu.

1325
01:38:50,604 --> 01:38:52,606
I leave Madara to you two.

1326
01:38:55,007 --> 01:38:58,677
We fought with a Reanimated ninja
on the way here.

1327
01:38:59,558 --> 01:39:02,519
The Sand shinobi sealed him...

1328
01:39:02,853 --> 01:39:06,398
But it seems he can't be killed, okay?

1329
01:39:07,187 --> 01:39:11,566
This is a perfect jutsu that
has no weaknesses, okay?

1330
01:39:13,072 --> 01:39:14,573
I told you earlier.

1331
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:18,619
There is a weakness in every jutsu.

1332
01:39:19,294 --> 01:39:20,412
I wonder about that...

1333
01:39:22,236 --> 01:39:24,071
No, I'll stop him!

1334
01:39:24,679 --> 01:39:28,600
Like I said...
Leave the rest to me!

1335
01:39:29,005 --> 01:39:30,507
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

1336
01:39:35,135 --> 01:39:37,513
You've used Nine-Tails
Chakra Mode too much.

1337
01:39:38,055 --> 01:39:40,265
No more clones right now, Naruto!

1338
01:39:41,892 --> 01:39:43,894
Don't try to do everything yourself.

1339
01:39:45,071 --> 01:39:48,533
I am the best one to put
an end to the Reanimation Jutsu.

1340
01:39:49,274 --> 01:39:50,442
I also have an idea.

1341
01:39:51,110 --> 01:39:53,946
I'll put an end to this war...

1342
01:39:54,306 --> 01:39:56,182
It's my responsibility!

1343
01:39:59,737 --> 01:40:03,205
I'll admit that you're stronger
than before.

1344
01:40:03,956 --> 01:40:05,250
But because of that,

1345
01:40:06,154 --> 01:40:08,419
you seem to have lost sight
of what's truly important.

1346
01:40:10,706 --> 01:40:12,875
Now listen carefully.

1347
01:40:13,866 --> 01:40:17,415
The villagers, who once shunned you,
have begun to admire you.

1348
01:40:18,220 --> 01:40:20,931
They think of you as a comrade.

1349
01:40:22,207 --> 01:40:27,462
It's because you fought hard
for their acceptance.

1350
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:33,402
You once said it was
everyone who cares about you

1351
01:40:33,402 --> 01:40:35,362
who helped you get
where you are now.

1352
01:40:37,238 --> 01:40:40,241
If you forget others because
you now have power,

1353
01:40:40,327 --> 01:40:42,996
and become arrogant...

1354
01:40:43,699 --> 01:40:46,832
you'll eventually become
just like Madara.

1355
01:40:47,291 --> 01:40:49,084
No matter how powerful
you become,

1356
01:40:49,392 --> 01:40:51,352
do not try to shoulder
everything alone.

1357
01:40:52,007 --> 01:40:54,259
If you do, you will surely fail.

1358
01:40:55,880 --> 01:40:59,008
Your father, Minato, was able to
fulfill his duty as the Hokage

1359
01:40:59,033 --> 01:41:02,661
because he had your mother, Kushina,
and his comrades at his side.

1360
01:41:06,872 --> 01:41:09,583
You share your father's dream,
don't you?

1361
01:41:10,943 --> 01:41:12,236
Then don't ever forget...

1362
01:41:13,837 --> 01:41:17,340
Becoming the Hokage doesn't mean
people will acknowledge you.

1363
01:41:17,939 --> 01:41:19,732
But when the people
acknowledge you,

1364
01:41:19,757 --> 01:41:21,134
you can become the Hokage.

1365
01:41:22,868 --> 01:41:24,161
Never forget your friends!

1366
01:41:27,982 --> 01:41:28,723
Naruto...

1367
01:41:30,248 --> 01:41:35,461
I promised that Iruka guy
that I'd keep you safe, no lie!

1368
01:41:35,714 --> 01:41:41,133
I won't let you go alone, bro!
Cuz' I'm still alive, and rarin' to go.

1369
01:41:43,555 --> 01:41:45,015
<i>Don't act like a spoiled brat!</i>

1370
01:41:45,206 --> 01:41:47,167
<i>To me, you are...</i>

1371
01:41:48,372 --> 01:41:50,041
<i>To me, you are...</i>

1372
01:41:51,188 --> 01:41:53,482
<i>An important student.</i>

1373
01:41:53,941 --> 01:41:57,653
<i>And... I think of you as
my little brother.</i>

1374
01:41:59,225 --> 01:42:02,645
<i>The enemy leader is targeting you
with everything he's got.</i>

1375
01:42:03,094 --> 01:42:07,149
<i>How can we allow you
to face such danger?</i>

1376
01:42:08,193 --> 01:42:11,786
<i>And besides, there is no reason for you
to shoulder that burden alone.</i>

1377
01:42:15,221 --> 01:42:18,036
You're right. I forgot.

1378
01:42:18,253 --> 01:42:20,102
I thought I had to do it all alone.

1379
01:42:28,267 --> 01:42:29,726
Wh-Why?!

1380
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:32,966
Shisui's eye won't reactivate for
another decade or so.

1381
01:42:34,148 --> 01:42:36,692
You won't be able to use it against Sasuke.

1382
01:42:37,269 --> 01:42:41,231
But you possess something
far greater than Shisui's eye.

1383
01:42:42,643 --> 01:42:45,396
You have the same soul as Shisui.

1384
01:42:46,118 --> 01:42:48,745
That is what Shisui really
wanted to pass on.

1385
01:42:50,247 --> 01:42:51,754
You don't need his eye anymore.

1386
01:42:51,942 --> 01:42:53,193
As you are now,

1387
01:42:53,218 --> 01:42:55,857
you can stop Sasuke without
something like this.

1388
01:42:56,837 --> 01:42:59,548
You can stand before Sasuke now.

1389
01:42:59,903 --> 01:43:00,657
This time, you can...

1390
01:43:00,682 --> 01:43:01,401
No.

1391
01:43:04,625 --> 01:43:07,920
I tried to do everything myself
and I failed.

1392
01:43:08,962 --> 01:43:12,676
This time, I will leave it
to my comrades.

1393
01:43:13,412 --> 01:43:17,547
You're not just a powerful shinobi.

1394
01:43:20,516 --> 01:43:23,394
Killer Bee...
Take care of Naruto.

1395
01:43:24,057 --> 01:43:25,048
For sure!

1396
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:36,283
Let's go, Octopops!

01:44:12,766 --> 01:44:14,143

1400
01:44:16,291 --> 01:44:18,377
