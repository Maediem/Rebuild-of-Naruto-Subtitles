1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,768
Incoming message!

2
00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:05,049
Killer Bee and Naruto have
both broken through the barrier,

3
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:06,606
and escaped.

4
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:07,890
What?!

5
00:00:08,129 --> 00:00:10,673
That barrier is supposed to
be impenetrable, even to Jinchuriki!

6
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:15,757
No one foresaw two Jinchuriki
coordinating an escape!

7
00:00:16,265 --> 00:00:17,409
Two of them?!

8
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:20,603
It seems Master Bee
is helping out.

9
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:22,188
Damn!

10
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:25,608
Now what are they up to?

11
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,778
I will personally stop the Jinchuriki.

12
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:31,072
Tsunade, you come too!

13
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,533
Who will manage Headquarters?

14
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:35,118
Shikaku of the Leaf!

15
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:36,956
Understood.

16
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,205
You can leave this to me.

17
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:41,624
All right!
Follow me, Tsunade!

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,168
Lord Raikage!

19
00:00:43,347 --> 00:00:45,766
Please try not to smash any walls.

20
00:00:48,704 --> 00:00:49,549
Let's go.

21
00:00:50,024 --> 00:00:51,993
Oh... right.

22
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,849
Don't be afraid!
Surround him!

23
00:03:01,075 --> 00:03:03,286
The tide of the war has suddenly
changed in their favor.

24
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:07,085
Darui, we must contact
HQ secretly and regroup.

25
00:03:07,673 --> 00:03:08,652
I know.

26
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,065
It's almost dark.

27
00:03:11,264 --> 00:03:13,560
We have to be prepared for
a night invasion and keep our eyes open.

28
00:03:21,008 --> 00:03:24,178
<i>Losing this war is not an option.</i>

29
00:03:25,734 --> 00:03:27,278
<i>Make no doubt about it.</i>

30
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:31,476
<i>My long-standing desire...
Project Tsuki no Me...</i>

31
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:35,304
<i>shall be realized tomorrow,
at long last...</i>

32
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:40,970
He's already sealed
Kinkaku and Ginkaku?

33
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:45,350
He only has part of
the Eight-Tails' chakra...

34
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,310
a single piece of his tentacles.

35
00:03:47,929 --> 00:03:50,640
I think you're rushing into this,

36
00:03:52,045 --> 00:03:54,173
but I'll go along with
your plans tonight...

37
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,945
I can't see the enemy.

38
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,529
What'll we do?

39
00:03:58,624 --> 00:04:01,001
Retreat? Or advance?

40
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,411
Right now, this company is
without captains.

41
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,999
We'll just have to stand
our ground and wait for orders.

42
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,628
Luckily, we have a bunch
of Sensory-Type ninja...

43
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,005
who are ideal for this.

44
00:04:19,145 --> 00:04:20,187
They're not coming...

45
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:23,085
I don't sense anything
in the sand either.

46
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:28,768
I should think the wiser move
with the Reanimation

47
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,187
is to keep raising the dead
and fight hard.

48
00:04:31,894 --> 00:04:33,938
Lord Gaara, please use this!

49
00:04:34,288 --> 00:04:36,374
You must conserve your strength.

50
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:39,237
Give that to him first.

51
00:04:39,636 --> 00:04:43,056
Huh? To this little old man?

52
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,493
I am the Tsuchikage.

53
00:04:45,645 --> 00:04:46,646
– Huh?!
– Huh?!

54
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,457
We have no idea what they may
be planning in the dark of night.

55
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,336
Stay on guard at all times.

56
00:04:55,615 --> 00:04:56,616
– Yes, sir!
– Yes, sir!

57
00:05:01,716 --> 00:05:04,844
Where is my ninja tool?!

58
00:05:06,698 --> 00:05:08,366
I want it back!

59
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,394
You were told not
to use it anymore!

60
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,355
I don't want to!

61
00:05:14,103 --> 00:05:15,829
I'm really good with it!

62
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,985
It's such a waste!

63
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:24,813
I notified HQ that Madara
has taken a Treasured Tool.

64
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:27,900
And that he got
the Tailed Beast's chakra.

65
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,414
I'm very sorry.
This was my fault.

66
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,000
If only we had
realized it sooner...

67
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:38,004
No, you responded well.

68
00:05:38,798 --> 00:05:40,800
It can't be helped that
he was unstoppable.

69
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:48,097
In any case, we were able
to repel the enemy for one more day.

70
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,728
Nearly 40,000 out of 80,000.

71
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:58,107
That's how many
the Allied Shinobi Forces lost today.

72
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,945
50,000 out of 100,000.

73
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,074
That's how many Akatsuki
we got today.

74
00:06:08,696 --> 00:06:11,115
Each side lost nearly
half its force.

75
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,200
But our side consists
of living flesh.

76
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,046
While the enemy...

77
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,192
The Nine-Tails' chakra Mode.

78
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:44,228
Great for lighting the night road,

79
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:48,408
could cost me my life
like a double-edged sword.

80
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:53,454
<i>It's okay to use Nine-Tails' chakra
like a flashlight.</i>

81
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,542
<i>But stick close to him, Bee!</i>

82
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:58,918
You got it.

83
00:07:03,272 --> 00:07:08,928
<i>You're always so careless
with my chakra...</i>

84
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:13,399
It's not like you

85
00:07:13,894 --> 00:07:16,632
to start up a conversation,
Nine-Tails.

86
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,516
I know you're starting to
get lonely and want to talk...

87
00:07:24,005 --> 00:07:26,590
but I'm busy now!
Let's do this later!

88
00:07:28,067 --> 00:07:33,072
<i>Do you seriously think you can
end this war by yourself?</i>

89
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,498
We'll talk after the war's over.

90
00:07:38,144 --> 00:07:38,792
Later.

91
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:46,308
<i>If your comrades are killed,
hatred will arise.</i>

92
00:07:46,914 --> 00:07:50,838
<i>Are you planning to defeat
the enemy before that happens?</i>

93
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,640
<i>And if you defeat the enemy,</i>

94
00:07:54,665 --> 00:07:57,251
<i>they'll bear hatred towards you...</i>

95
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,230
<i>Do you honestly think</i>

96
00:08:01,605 --> 00:08:04,549
<i>you can take all of that
on by yourself?</i>

97
00:08:08,056 --> 00:08:12,018
Don't keep underestimating me.

98
00:08:15,658 --> 00:08:17,201
<i>You don't understand a thing!</i>

99
00:08:17,717 --> 00:08:18,885
<i>You're naïve!</i>

100
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:25,338
<i>Can you honestly take on and
erase everyone's hatred?!</i>

101
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,967
<i>The war has already begun.</i>

102
00:08:31,568 --> 00:08:34,363
<i>There must be a considerable
amount of casualties already.</i>

103
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:38,802
<i>And the resulting hatred to match...</i>

104
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:42,565
<i>First,</i>

105
00:08:42,968 --> 00:08:45,208
<i>Sasuke who used to
stand alongside you,</i>

106
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,818
<i>has been gripped by hatred
for a long time.</i>

107
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:53,074
<i>Have you ever been able
to do anything for him?</i>

108
00:08:56,525 --> 00:08:57,818
<i>In other words...</i>

109
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,631
<i>Regardless of who
you're dealing with,</i>

110
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,246
<i>you can neither erase their hatred
nor take it on yourself!</i>

111
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,212
So...

112
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,758
Are you done?

113
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,552
<i>What?</i>

114
00:09:16,859 --> 00:09:17,511
Hey...

115
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,110
You're the one who's naïve!

116
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,905
<i>How can you be so confident</i>

117
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,283
<i>when you couldn't even
save Sasuke?</i>

118
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:41,331
Once you question
your own beliefs, it's over.

119
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,846
I will help Sasuke somehow,

120
00:09:43,871 --> 00:09:46,040
and I will do something
about this war!

121
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:58,139
<i>The little brat thinks
he's all grown up, does he?</i>

122
00:10:02,315 --> 00:10:05,104
Ya know, Nine-Tails, I...

123
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:13,112
I'm going to come after all that
hate inside you as well some day!

124
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,450
You've put me through
a lot of pain,

125
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:23,289
but I know that it doesn't feel
good to be at the mercy of hatred...

126
00:10:25,201 --> 00:10:26,821
<i>Are you stupid?!</i>

127
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,487
<i>I'm the Nine-Tails!</i>

128
00:10:28,927 --> 00:10:32,264
<i>Some little brat
can't change me!</i>

129
00:10:32,806 --> 00:10:35,350
<i>I am hatred!</i>

130
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,011
Then it's okay!

131
00:10:37,189 --> 00:10:40,587
I'm no longer a little brat and it
will be more challenging this way!

132
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,767
Later!

133
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:49,231
<i>So cocky.</i>

134
00:11:39,822 --> 00:11:40,616
Hey!

135
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,826
Neji, are you all right?!

136
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,035
Yeah...

137
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,531
I'm okay.

138
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:46,914
Don't overdo it.

139
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,543
Your eyes aren't the only thing
that can track the enemy.

140
00:11:50,568 --> 00:11:51,861
I have my nose.

141
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,838
Leave this to me and

142
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,382
get yourself checked out
by the Medical Corps.

143
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,470
There's a medic tent in the rear center
of every company.

144
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,013
The coordinates are...

145
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:22,368
I need two Jonin Medics
over here, please!

146
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,785
We have to resuscitate now!

147
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:25,703
Quickly!

148
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,746
– Right!
– Right!

149
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,001
Are you sure you can
handle this much?

150
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,423
Halt, please!

151
00:12:38,099 --> 00:12:40,234
Under orders from HQ,

152
00:12:40,435 --> 00:12:43,220
we Sensory-type shinobi will
have to verify your chakra!

153
00:12:44,824 --> 00:12:47,035
We will not allow you to pass
until this is done!

154
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:48,976
Sure, I understand.

155
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:51,413
Hurry and get it over with.

156
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,315
I'll bandage it...

157
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:56,692
Okay...

158
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,152
That should do it.

159
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,154
Thank you...

160
00:13:01,182 --> 00:13:02,183
Take care.

161
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,328
Okay, next please.

162
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,184
Neji!

163
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,085
I've taken care of all
your external wounds.

164
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,588
Thanks.

165
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,508
Please get some rest,
while you can.

166
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,551
Especially your eyes!

167
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,637
You shouldn't overuse them.

168
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,097
That's easier said than done.

169
00:13:28,097 --> 00:13:31,684
My job is to discern things
faster than anyone,

170
00:13:32,204 --> 00:13:35,691
and notify HQ, in order to improve
our chances in battle.

171
00:13:36,744 --> 00:13:39,539
To do that, I have to put
my eyes to work.

172
00:13:40,038 --> 00:13:41,039
I know that.

173
00:13:41,627 --> 00:13:43,171
But while you're here...

174
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,230
Thanks.

175
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:02,633
All right, the next tents on
our rounds are F5 through G3.

176
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:12,434
B-Bad news! Toyosa, Takemaru,
and Hino are dead.

177
00:14:12,903 --> 00:14:14,321
Someone has assassinated them!

178
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:15,604
What?!

179
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,568
What's going on?

180
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:24,363
A spy has infiltrated us.

181
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:28,617
They're targeting Jonin medics.

182
00:14:29,567 --> 00:14:30,877
But how?

183
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,080
In order to get here,

184
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,333
everyone's chakra undergoes
strict verification.

185
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,378
It's impossible with a simple
Transformation Jutsu.

186
00:14:40,096 --> 00:14:43,225
And you cannot get through here unless
you're a shinobi of the Allied Forces.

187
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,175
Which means...

188
00:14:45,402 --> 00:14:49,234
that a shinobi of the Allied Forces is being
manipulated by a jutsu. It's highly probable.

189
00:14:50,065 --> 00:14:51,191
It's a formidable jutsu.

190
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:52,683
I see...

191
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:56,729
If there are only
Allied Force shinobi here,

192
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,147
they'll be hard to distinguish.

193
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,691
We can't tell who the suspect is.

194
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,485
We're all standing
around right now,

195
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,447
and it could be any one of us.

196
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,658
And this is sure to breed
suspicion among us.

197
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,745
That's what the enemy
is hoping for.

198
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:17,541
We medical ninja are critical for
our battle strategy to succeed.

199
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,394
There's no way you can confront

200
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,881
the undead from the Reanimation Jutsu
without our back-up.

201
00:15:26,754 --> 00:15:28,681
If we're paralyzed now...

202
00:15:28,901 --> 00:15:31,237
It will ruin our chances in the battle,
that starts at dawn.

203
00:15:32,085 --> 00:15:35,988
I'll find the killer with
my own eyes!

204
00:15:41,798 --> 00:15:45,176
In any case, no matter what happens,
we cannot ignore the wounded.

205
00:15:45,924 --> 00:15:47,093
We'll continue our treatment.

206
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,949
But we must be extra careful.

207
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,618
Especially the Jonin medics.

208
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,544
Now then...

209
00:16:03,326 --> 00:16:06,465
I-It's time to go on rounds.

210
00:16:07,152 --> 00:16:08,076
Y-Yeah...

211
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:17,601
Wh-Where did I... first meet you?

212
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:18,250
Huh?!

213
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:22,064
No... Listen, it's not like
I'm suspicious of you.

214
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,774
Of course not.

215
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,651
It's just... just...

216
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,111
You are suspicious of me!

217
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:30,815
Oh, it's you.

218
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,574
Don't scare us like that.

219
00:16:33,901 --> 00:16:36,126
Say, have you seen
Sakura Haruno?

220
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:37,596
Is something wrong?

221
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,499
I got suspicious about someone.

222
00:16:41,466 --> 00:16:43,927
I was tailing him, but lost him...

223
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:48,757
Thinking back, I get the feeling that
he was hanging around Sakura.

224
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,301
Sakura is in Tent 3.

225
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:55,431
What does this suspicious guy
look like?

226
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,633
Oh! It's you.

227
00:16:58,294 --> 00:16:59,810
Is your wound still bothering you?

228
00:17:00,547 --> 00:17:03,967
Oh, no... It's fine.

229
00:17:06,934 --> 00:17:10,988
A-Actually, ever since you treated me...

230
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:15,367
I haven't been able to
stop thinking about you.

231
00:17:21,742 --> 00:17:22,826
What is this?

232
00:17:23,002 --> 00:17:25,171
I-It's... a love letter.

233
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,148
When I go into battle again,

234
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,592
there's no guarantee that
I'll come back alive.

235
00:17:32,194 --> 00:17:33,010
So...

236
00:17:35,307 --> 00:17:36,129
Thank you.

237
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:40,583
But... I'm already in love
with someone.

238
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,561
Oh, I see...

239
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,689
I guess he's probably... from the Leaf.

240
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:54,073
Well, a rejected man has no right
to pry into who you love.

241
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,036
I understand. I'll go now.

242
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,276
I'm sorry...

243
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,000
I hope it all works out.

244
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,586
If you love him...

245
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,590
he must be a great man.

246
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:35,405
You all right?

247
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:36,740
Neji...

248
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,327
It's easy to get discouraged.

249
00:18:40,747 --> 00:18:44,500
We don't even know
who we're fighting.

250
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:51,088
Are you sure you don't need
to go to the medical corps?

251
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,633
Cut it out, Kiba! I said I'm fine!

252
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,637
You overused your Byakugan
and can barely stand!

253
00:18:59,331 --> 00:19:01,917
So don't bother showing off
in front of your subordinates!

254
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,376
Shut up, Kiba!

255
00:19:04,396 --> 00:19:06,190
What the hell? You're so weak,

256
00:19:06,215 --> 00:19:07,982
you can't tell the difference
between a dog and a man!

257
00:19:08,007 --> 00:19:10,468
And your Visual Prowess is
supposed to be your specialty!

258
00:19:13,632 --> 00:19:14,633
By the way, Sakura...

259
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:16,932
Where is Captain Shizune now?

260
00:19:17,454 --> 00:19:20,541
Huh? Did you figure something out?

261
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,661
Yeah... a little.

262
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:26,331
We need to be in contact to report
anything, no matter how trivial it is...

263
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,667
Until we find the suspect.

264
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,446
Well, I think she's in Tent B-2.

265
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,567
Shizune is treating Tonton.

266
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:38,645
Seems like a bad leg sprain.

267
00:19:39,926 --> 00:19:41,928
Well, that's better
than injuring a hand.

268
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,641
Will they be able to
rejoin the battle?

269
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:46,852
I think so...

270
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,895
Tonton can still weave signs,
since the hand is uninjured.

271
00:19:50,317 --> 00:19:52,444
I see... That's good.

272
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,109
By the way...

273
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:58,614
Sakura, would you mind taking
a look at my arm one more time?

274
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,157
It hurts a little.

275
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:01,867
Sure...

276
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,744
You can sit over there.

277
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,143
How did you know?!

278
00:20:28,564 --> 00:20:30,190
Pigs don't have hands!

279
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,605
Cha!

280
00:20:33,176 --> 00:20:36,554
Tonton... is a pig?!

281
00:20:37,661 --> 00:20:39,747
<i>She tricked us! Smart alec!</i>

282
00:20:40,351 --> 00:20:42,979
So, you're the murderer!

283
00:20:47,171 --> 00:20:50,799
My Transformation Jutsu
is the best.

284
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:55,856
I may not be the only who
has infiltrated this place.

285
00:20:57,369 --> 00:21:00,372
<i>If this is just like
Captain Yamato's report...</i>

286
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,347
<i>Note... Regarding Parasitic Clones.</i>

287
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:08,914
<i>Kisame Hoshigaki was originally
thought to have been taken down</i>

288
00:21:08,939 --> 00:21:10,733
<i>by the Raikage and Killer Bee...</i>

289
00:21:11,084 --> 00:21:12,461
<i>But it appears he survived,</i>

290
00:21:12,486 --> 00:21:14,697
<i>having switched places
with a parasitic clone</i>

291
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,817
<i>or something that is a type
of Transformation Jutsu.</i>

292
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,661
<i>Because this transformation also
replicates the target's chakra,</i>

293
00:21:19,686 --> 00:21:21,271
<i>it is difficult to detect.</i>

294
00:21:21,745 --> 00:21:23,247
<i>At the Five Kage Summit,</i>

295
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,451
<i>Zetsu of the Akatsuki suddenly
emerged from other people's bodies.</i>

296
00:21:27,151 --> 00:21:28,652
<i>He had absorbed chakra...</i>

297
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,707
What happened?!

298
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,375
Did you hear that loud
sound just now?!

299
00:21:34,246 --> 00:21:35,623
Who's that?!

300
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:38,293
I have to contact HQ immediately!

301
00:21:38,488 --> 00:21:39,698
Please take care of this guy!

302
00:21:43,211 --> 00:21:44,212
Empty it all out!

303
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:46,305
We're on guard duty next.

304
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,473
My bladder must be bigger than yours.

305
00:21:48,772 --> 00:21:50,858
Check out the ripples I made!

306
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,275
The ripples are...

307
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,677
Don't forget to piss either, Tetsu!

308
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,566
It's going to be a long night.

309
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:02,738
How about if I make you
bleed instead?

310
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,367
It happened again!

311
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,661
There are reports from
every sector that

312
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:12,414
our comrades are being ambushed
one after another!

313
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,333
There's confusion everywhere!

314
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,876
We don't know who the enemy is!

315
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,461
What's going on?!

316
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:20,130
A night raid is supposed
to have been ruled out!

317
00:22:20,856 --> 00:22:23,734
On top of that, we added security and
positioned Sensory-type ninja...

318
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,927
Why can't we detect the enemy?!

319
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,055
Is it some kind of poison?

320
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,223
What's the condition of the corpses?

321
00:22:30,456 --> 00:22:32,271
All of them have external wounds.

322
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,144
They're physical attacks.

323
00:22:36,626 --> 00:22:40,296
No doubt they're controlling
Allied shinobi with genjutsu.

324
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,153
Could it be Itachi?

325
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,239
Hold on! We just got word from
the medical corps.

326
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,868
The enemy looks to be...

327
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:54,081
White Zetsu transformed into
Allied Force shinobi!

328
00:22:54,537 --> 00:22:56,497
They're able to mirror chakra imprints!

329
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,460
That explains it...

330
00:22:58,904 --> 00:23:00,452
So during the day battle,

331
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,843
if one of our shinobi got
his chakra absorbed,

332
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:05,425
White Zetsu can transform
into him completely!

333
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,886
What should we do,
Shikaku of the Leaf?

334
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,770
There is no way we can weed out
who is friend and who is foe!

335
00:23:11,795 --> 00:23:13,933
How will we prepare for
the battle at dawn?

336
00:23:14,581 --> 00:23:16,959
If we don't find
the enemy immediately,

337
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:18,730
we'll not only lose precious time,

338
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,273
but our own men will
become casualties!

339
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:24,027
In the end, they could
end up killing each other!

340
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,364
So this is the power of White Zetsu.

341
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:31,965
The battle during the day was
merely a setup for the night...

342
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,372
This was the enemy's true motive.

343
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,426
There's no sign of enemy movement.

344
00:23:48,447 --> 00:23:50,915
Okay, but stay alert.

345
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:54,417
Yes. I have look-outs
posted everywhere.

346
00:24:02,935 --> 00:24:03,936
I'm here to relieve you.

347
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:05,819
Okay. Thanks.

348
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,740
Get some rest. We'll keep watch.

349
00:24:12,226 --> 00:24:13,118
Okay.

350
00:24:25,523 --> 00:24:27,609
Deidara... Deidara.

351
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:31,261
Stop casually calling out
my name like that!

352
00:24:31,594 --> 00:24:33,847
It's me, Zetsu.

353
00:24:33,941 --> 00:24:35,108
Zetsu? Is that you?!

354
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,890
You were a fun guy.

355
00:24:38,716 --> 00:24:41,052
I'm going to help you
for old time's sake.

356
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,064
Thanks. Quickly!

357
00:24:43,783 --> 00:24:44,579
Hurry.

358
00:24:44,848 --> 00:24:46,413
Hold on a second...

359
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:52,324
Oh that? In there?

360
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:56,578
What is it?

361
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,206
So, Big Brother Deidara... you still alive?

362
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,707
I'm dead.

363
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,667
That voice... Is that you, Kurotsuchi?

364
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:05,079
Did you come to rescue me
for old time's sake?

365
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:08,459
I was sent here because
we used to be friends,

366
00:25:08,665 --> 00:25:10,150
but the situation's just
the opposite now.

367
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,801
I came because I need your help.

368
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,304
Huh? What do you mean by that?

369
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,806
<i>She's interrogating
the Hidden Stone ninja.</i>

370
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,726
Where is Kabuto Yakushi?

371
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,093
How should I know!

372
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:23,313
I wouldn't tell you even if I knew, hmm.

373
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,232
Look, bro...

374
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:27,161
Kabuto brought you back to life

375
00:25:27,186 --> 00:25:28,812
and is now using you at
his convenience.

376
00:25:29,251 --> 00:25:32,254
You're dead, so the least
you can do is forget the past,

377
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,448
and cooperate with us a little.

378
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:39,413
Kabuto gave me an opportunity
to acquire the Super Ultimate Art.

379
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:43,426
All right.
Then where is Sasuke Uchiha?

380
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,081
Sasuke, you say?

381
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,754
Are you saying
he was reanimated, as well?

382
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,258
Sasuke's not dead!

383
00:25:51,537 --> 00:25:52,705
Don't be ridiculous!

384
00:25:52,765 --> 00:25:55,476
I killed him with my Ultimate Art!

385
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,315
But I saw him.

386
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,828
After you died, bro,
Sasuke was alive and well.

387
00:25:59,853 --> 00:26:01,730
He was fighting with the Raikage
and the others.

388
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,488
<i>A-Amazing.</i>

389
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:18,076
He joined the Akatsuki and
is an enemy of the Allied Forces.

390
00:26:18,628 --> 00:26:20,107
He's with the Akatsuki?!

391
00:26:20,803 --> 00:26:21,346
Right?

392
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,748
Huh?! Yeah, I guess.

393
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,458
What's with that?

394
00:26:25,606 --> 00:26:28,067
Sasuke's alive?
And he's a member of Akatsuki?

395
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:29,288
You've have to be kidding.

396
00:26:29,843 --> 00:26:31,970
There's no way
he could still be alive!

397
00:26:32,065 --> 00:26:33,942
I'm telling you he's alive.

398
00:26:34,147 --> 00:26:36,149
That was my Ultimate Art!

399
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:39,139
Nobody cares about art.

400
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,223
Sasuke, that bastard!

401
00:26:40,756 --> 00:26:43,843
What was up with that guy?!
Wasn't he in awe?

402
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:47,147
Didn't he tremble with fear?
Didn't he despair?

403
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:50,066
Didn't he scream,
"What the hell is this?!"?

404
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,861
Screw you, Sasuke!

405
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,281
Your Lightning Style won't
hold me down forever!

406
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,138
Brother?

407
00:27:00,526 --> 00:27:03,611
Hey, are you listening, bro?
Answer me!

408
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:06,041
This isn't getting anywhere!

409
00:27:06,646 --> 00:27:08,606
Open it. I want to speak
with him directly.

410
00:27:09,476 --> 00:27:10,519
You want me to open it?

411
00:27:12,781 --> 00:27:13,365
Hey.

412
00:27:13,651 --> 00:27:14,366
Sir!

413
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:15,961
Mountain.

414
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:17,854
Huh?

415
00:27:18,765 --> 00:27:19,601
Mountain...

416
00:27:20,961 --> 00:27:22,905
Distant skies?

417
00:27:26,189 --> 00:27:26,922
It's "River."

418
00:27:27,121 --> 00:27:28,602
Damn samurai!

419
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,996
You're so predictable.

420
00:27:33,021 --> 00:27:33,564
You bastards!

421
00:27:33,631 --> 00:27:34,674
They're Zetsu!

422
00:27:34,883 --> 00:27:35,675
What?!

423
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,365
Careful! They'll absorb your chakra!

424
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,753
Art is... an explosion.

425
00:27:52,053 --> 00:27:53,346
Deidara!

426
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:57,801
How?! Why didn't the Lightning Style
seal his Explosion Style?!

427
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,597
Is that how you channeled
the Lightning Style away?

428
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,225
What was that doing
inside the puppet?!

429
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,268
It was thanks to me...

430
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,104
Zetsu.

431
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,271
What?

432
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,065
Let's get out of here!

433
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,775
Huh? Wait!

434
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:14,818
Don't let him get away!

435
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:18,029
Man, he's troublesome
even when he's dead!

436
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,824
The prisoner, Deidara,
has escaped.

437
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,743
He's with his comrade, Zetsu.
Apprehend them!

438
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:24,744
Okisuke.

439
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,665
I will take full responsibility
for my blunder, I swear!

440
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,835
This is not the time for regrets.
After them!

441
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,086
Yes, sir!

442
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:35,213
Why are we running?

443
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,756
Let's kill them!

444
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,008
I'm out of Detonating Clay.

445
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,969
I need to get more somewhere.

446
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,555
Uh-oh... They're coming!

447
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:51,604
You're in my way!

448
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,151
In front, too!

449
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,194
Damn it!

450
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,242
Still weak as ever, aren't you?

451
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,245
That was a tactic to
give us more time.

452
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,789
<i>Looks like you escaped the seal.</i>

453
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,083
Kabuto!

454
00:29:13,057 --> 00:29:15,184
I would've expected nothing less.
I'll take that back.

455
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,671
<i>Wait!</i>

456
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,758
<i>My Ultimate Art was
completely rejected!</i>

457
00:29:20,028 --> 00:29:21,237
<i>I can't die like this...</i>

458
00:29:21,901 --> 00:29:23,653
<i>even if I'm already dead. Hmm.</i>

459
00:29:24,583 --> 00:29:26,335
You intend to stand and fight there?

460
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:30,185
<i>I'm going to perfect
my Super Ultimate Art!</i>

461
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:33,605
I just don't understand
how you artists think.

462
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:37,901
But intellectuals have
to protect artists.

463
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:41,362
That's...

464
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,366
Get away. I'll hold them off.

465
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,202
I'll leave them to you, Chukichi!

466
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,281
<i>Hidden Frost Jutsu.</i>

467
00:29:58,838 --> 00:29:59,923
What the hell?!

468
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,549
Where is he hiding?

469
00:30:09,834 --> 00:30:11,211
That's... a lot of 'em.

470
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,191
He's gone!

471
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:19,951
Curses!

472
00:30:22,415 --> 00:30:23,416
I sense them!

473
00:30:23,695 --> 00:30:25,238
Commander Mifune!
They went that way!

474
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:26,989
Let's go.

475
00:30:29,938 --> 00:30:31,398
How much farther
are we going to run?

476
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,623
I need clay, hmm!

477
00:30:34,142 --> 00:30:36,395
I need to find a place
with clay in the soil.

478
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:39,254
Leave that to me.

479
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:44,884
Unless we catch Big Brother Deidara
before he finds some clay,

480
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:46,386
this could get troublesome.

481
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,514
Previously, Omoi of the Cloud
contained the explosion

482
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:50,598
with his Lightning Style,

483
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,725
but he is in a different unit now.

484
00:30:53,945 --> 00:30:56,114
Do we have anyone in this unit
who can handle lightning?

485
00:30:56,179 --> 00:30:58,223
Fifth Company split into two.

486
00:30:58,929 --> 00:31:01,015
Our company's main weapon
is samurai.

487
00:31:01,283 --> 00:31:05,612
Our only ninja are sensory, sealing,
and intel support personnel.

488
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:09,325
Commander Mifune,
I am able to do Lightning Style.

489
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:11,266
Good...

490
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:26,342
They're coming, Deidara!
Our pursuers!

491
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:27,552
What?!

492
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,804
I've only managed to get
this much Detonating Clay!

493
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:31,472
Scatter!

494
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:36,853
<i>Lightning Style!</i>

495
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:42,483
What's happening?!

496
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:43,568
Did Big Bro—?!

497
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:44,485
Under us!

498
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,361
Land mines!

499
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:46,362
Jump!

500
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,868
You're not going to stop us!

501
00:32:01,329 --> 00:32:02,061
Take that!

502
00:32:10,272 --> 00:32:12,107
Not enough, hmm.

503
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,353
This is art!

504
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,685
Big Brother's going to explode.

505
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,800
You have to keep the current flowing!

506
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,030
We need a more powerful
Lightning Style!

507
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:31,074
Th-This is the best I can do!

508
00:32:33,933 --> 00:32:34,934
Lord Mifune!

509
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,884
Hey, Deidara...

510
00:32:52,033 --> 00:32:55,139
How tacky! The despair, hmm!

511
00:32:56,045 --> 00:32:56,874
Why?

512
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,978
Art is a moment of brilliance,

513
00:33:00,287 --> 00:33:01,883
blossoms that scatter all at once.

514
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,857
But this body can't scatter!

515
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,612
I'm going to find
a Super Ultimate Art

516
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,115
that transcends
the Ultimate Art, hmm.

517
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,915
Damn you, bro!

518
00:33:24,973 --> 00:33:26,838
Lord Mifune? Where are you?

519
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:30,466
Lord Mifune!

520
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,929
The holes left by his landmines
became trenches.

521
00:33:37,707 --> 00:33:40,543
Bro Deidara wasn't very thorough
with his Detonating Clay, was he?

522
00:33:41,114 --> 00:33:42,004
We'll need a plan.

523
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,774
With insulation, we could keep him
from grounding the lightning.

524
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:48,763
The problem is
our Lightning Style wielder.

525
00:33:49,154 --> 00:33:51,170
But... I'm not...

526
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,156
You just concentrate on
sensing their whereabouts.

527
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,825
Shall I request Headquarters
for reinforcements?

528
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,327
We don't have time to wait
for reinforcements.

529
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,209
We'll do this with
the personnel we have.

530
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,221
<i>What am I going to do?</i>

531
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:22,060
<i>This immortal body and
my aesthetic are incompatible.</i>

532
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,897
<i>Sasori might be able
to do something.</i>

533
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,274
<i>But he went off quickly.</i>

534
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,694
<i>I'm all alone.</i>

535
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,615
<i>But artists are loners
to begin with, hmm.</i>

536
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,631
I buried the landmines.

537
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:41,037
Well? Got any ideas?

538
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:44,665
Art doesn't come to one that easily.

539
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:48,127
Especially not a Super Ultimate Art!

540
00:35:09,728 --> 00:35:10,489
Sasuke?!

541
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,777
Why are you here?

542
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,245
It's you guys...

543
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,206
Bastard! Why are you alive?!

544
00:35:26,084 --> 00:35:27,057
Where's Naruto?

545
00:35:27,868 --> 00:35:28,810
I don't know!

546
00:35:28,954 --> 00:35:31,039
Right now, pay attention to me, hmm!

547
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:33,556
My business is with Naruto.

548
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:36,247
Damn it, not that again!

549
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,024
First Itachi, now Naruto?!

550
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:40,555
You really don't give
a damn about me, do you?!

551
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:42,865
Nope.

552
00:35:43,662 --> 00:35:44,746
Bastard!

553
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,310
They're coming!

554
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,520
See ya.

555
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:48,822
Stop!

556
00:35:48,881 --> 00:35:49,882
Deidara!

557
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:52,483
Don't let them get away!

558
00:35:55,503 --> 00:35:56,401
You're not getting away!

559
00:35:56,426 --> 00:35:57,427
Deidara! Wait!

560
00:36:01,794 --> 00:36:03,629
This time,
I'll make you tremble with fear!

561
00:36:03,813 --> 00:36:05,148
You'll be awed!

562
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,998
You'll feel despair.

563
00:36:07,488 --> 00:36:09,949
I'll wipe that smug expression
off your face!

564
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,350
I see!

565
00:36:26,849 --> 00:36:28,935
There! Over there!

566
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,607
I knew it. Your weakness
isn't lightning, bro.

567
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:34,358
It's your stupid obsession with art!

568
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:39,238
Kurotsuchi?!

569
00:36:40,959 --> 00:36:42,786
Bastards! What's the meaning of this?

570
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:49,665
A dud?

571
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:54,962
Damn it!

572
00:36:59,752 --> 00:37:02,796
That sword won't stop my art!

573
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,269
A samurai using Lightning Style?!

574
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,271
It's not Lightning Style.

575
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,441
It's a battery... Seems it works.

576
00:37:18,062 --> 00:37:19,063
Does it...?

577
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,781
What the—?!

578
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:25,368
This is all bedrock, bro.

579
00:37:26,218 --> 00:37:27,595
The sword can't penetrate.

580
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:29,993
Even if it could, it won't let
the lightning be grounded.

581
00:37:36,572 --> 00:37:38,157
Damn it! Hey! Let me go!

582
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:45,930
All right.

583
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:52,186
And one other thing, bro.

584
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,747
Where is the real Sasuke right now?

585
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:58,609
Damn it, Kurotsuchi.
Don't take me for a fool!

586
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,821
Pretending to be Sasuke!
You even looked like him!

587
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,155
Screw you!

588
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:08,035
Yeah, I suppose it's no use trying
to get info out of you, bro.

589
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:09,662
You're totally screwed.

590
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,622
We're heading back.

591
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,628
We'll maintain our original frontline.

592
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,417
Inform Headquarters.

593
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,588
Commander, could I have that back?

594
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:26,512
Don't bother us again,
brother Deidara!

595
00:38:27,207 --> 00:38:28,107
See ya!

596
00:38:35,247 --> 00:38:36,390
That might work, hmm!

597
00:38:36,877 --> 00:38:39,463
I've decided the theme of
my Super Ultimate Art!

598
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:43,487
That thing could use a face!

599
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,952
Art will never die!

600
00:38:50,722 --> 00:38:53,099
Even if I'm dead... Hmm!

601
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:01,213
What's wrong?

602
00:39:01,887 --> 00:39:04,181
<i>The enemy is disguising
themselves as allies!</i>

603
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:06,427
<i>Maybe you're an enemy!</i>

604
00:39:06,793 --> 00:39:08,128
<i>We can't trust anyone!</i>

605
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,722
What's going on?!

606
00:39:10,602 --> 00:39:13,272
There's murkiness spreading
everywhere!

607
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,400
G-Granny?!

608
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:24,195
No! B-Breasts...

609
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:25,894
Bee!

610
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,341
How dare you stare at
the Hokage's chest

611
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,867
when I'm standing
right in front of you!

612
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:34,372
Oh no, bro! I meant no offense.
I'm just shocked, is all.

613
00:39:34,635 --> 00:39:37,492
The Hokage's jugs are
definitely immense.

614
00:39:37,725 --> 00:39:39,377
We're here to stop you!

615
00:39:39,551 --> 00:39:41,595
You will not pass!

616
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:48,903
<i>So this is what Naruto looks like when
he's in control of the Nine-Tails' power...</i>

617
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:51,013
<i>You did it, Naruto.</i>

618
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,349
S-Such immense chakra!

619
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:54,900
Bro!

620
00:39:55,028 --> 00:39:57,364
Let Naruto pass... Hear my plea.

621
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,023
I can vouch for him, that I guarantee.

622
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:05,069
Silence! We are fighting
this war to protect you two!

623
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,103
If you guys are captured...

624
00:40:06,128 --> 00:40:09,334
The enemy has perfected their jutsu
and the world is about to end.

625
00:40:09,568 --> 00:40:11,175
Iruka-sensei told us.

626
00:40:11,233 --> 00:40:12,943
If you know that, why are you going?

627
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:14,362
Are you crazy?!

628
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,963
It's because of that!

629
00:40:24,731 --> 00:40:26,441
It's because they're protecting us!

630
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,843
I can't stand it that
people are dying for me!

631
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,595
If they die fighting
and we win this war...

632
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,932
and I'm the only one left standing...
It's not worth it!

633
00:40:35,497 --> 00:40:36,736
I don't want that!

634
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:39,741
It's better than the world ending!

635
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:42,356
We all believe that.
That's why we're fighting,

636
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,233
prepared to sacrifice
ourselves to protect you!

637
00:40:44,434 --> 00:40:45,852
You think that I can just sit here,

638
00:40:45,994 --> 00:40:48,872
unharmed and do nothing
when I know that?

639
00:40:49,081 --> 00:40:51,708
I'm not that kind of guy!

640
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:52,950
Besides...

641
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,953
Don't try to talk your way out!
You will not pass!

642
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:01,625
<i>Can you keep up with me
in this Mode?</i>

643
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,194
<i>What is that punch?
Damn, it's powerful!</i>

644
00:41:07,309 --> 00:41:08,935
<i>I'd better avoid a direct hit.</i>

645
00:41:14,033 --> 00:41:16,118
Granny Tsunade,
you understand me, don't you?!

646
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,809
I'll stop this war!

647
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:20,175
Let me go!

648
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,441
Granny...

649
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:31,197
We are now part of
the Allied Shinobi Force.

650
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:34,200
These orders are from
the Allied Forces.

651
00:41:34,543 --> 00:41:38,238
Even though I am the Hokage,
I cannot act on my own!

652
00:41:44,467 --> 00:41:48,846
Okay. I understand the position
you're in, Granny.

653
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,049
Then, I'll just force my way through!

654
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,553
<i>This time, I'll do it faster.</i>

655
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:04,355
You're fast, old man Raikage...

656
00:42:05,671 --> 00:42:06,422
<i>No...</i>

657
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:09,464
<i>It's amazing that when
you're in Nine-Tail Chakra Mode,</i>

658
00:42:09,489 --> 00:42:11,700
<i>you can match
the Raikage's speed.</i>

659
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:15,366
There's no shinobi faster than me.

660
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:18,035
Not since the Fourth Hokage!

661
00:42:19,207 --> 00:42:20,542
You knew my dad?!

662
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:23,824
We fought many times.

663
00:42:24,413 --> 00:42:27,749
I came to believe that
no one could ever defeat him.

664
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:31,826
I understand that Jiraiya
of the Legendary Sannin

665
00:42:32,053 --> 00:42:35,678
called him the Child of Prophecy...
the savior of the world.

666
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,807
So why is this savior
not around to stop this crisis?

667
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:43,143
Because he failed during
the incident of the Nine-Tails!

668
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,522
You are his son, yet you haven't
learned anything from that.

669
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:50,742
Only a fool speaks without knowing
the odds...

670
00:42:50,767 --> 00:42:52,310
If that's all...

671
00:42:52,985 --> 00:42:57,030
If that's all you have to say,
don't talk about my Dad.

672
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:01,986
<i>And you were born.</i>

673
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:07,501
<i>Minato cried and said,
"From today, I'm a father!"</i>

674
00:43:08,036 --> 00:43:09,913
<i>He believed in you
with all his heart.</i>

675
00:43:11,708 --> 00:43:14,920
The Fourth Hokage did not fail!

676
00:43:15,055 --> 00:43:17,683
If you... insist on going...

677
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,552
I will kill you right here!

678
00:43:20,741 --> 00:43:22,577
Wha—?! Hey, Raikage!

679
00:43:22,749 --> 00:43:26,448
This way, we'll be able to buy some
time until the Nine-Tails is revived.

680
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:30,566
And the enemy will be forced
to postpone their plans!

681
00:43:31,131 --> 00:43:32,527
Looks like you want to die.

682
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:36,694
Wait!

683
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,744
Bee, you...!

684
00:43:42,799 --> 00:43:44,259
Oh... He was saved!

685
00:43:44,882 --> 00:43:48,118
In that case, why don't I,
the Eight-Tails, die?

686
00:43:48,443 --> 00:43:51,404
Then the enemy's plan
can kiss itself goodbye!

687
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,633
If Naruto can go to the battlefield...
my life is one I'd gladly yield.

688
00:43:56,477 --> 00:43:57,979
Octopops...

689
00:43:58,587 --> 00:43:59,546
Raikage!

690
00:43:59,708 --> 00:44:01,501
You cannot make
any arbitrary decisions

691
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,515
without consulting the other
Allied Shinobi Force leaders.

692
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:05,682
You may be the Supreme Commander,
but I won't let you!

693
00:44:06,792 --> 00:44:10,421
My responsibility is to make sure
we win this war!

694
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:13,025
No matter what it takes!

695
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:16,695
Then as Eight-Tails said,
why are you targeting Naruto?

696
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,490
When the time comes, as Raikage,

697
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:21,492
I will be prepared to kill
my own younger brother!

698
00:44:21,898 --> 00:44:25,093
But right now...
I choose to kill Naruto over Bee!

699
00:44:25,981 --> 00:44:27,900
Because Bee is the Jinchuriki

700
00:44:27,925 --> 00:44:30,302
who is able to control
the Tailed Beast's power...

701
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:32,077
That makes him
a stronger military weapon!

702
00:44:32,508 --> 00:44:34,051
Unhand me, Bee!

703
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:36,946
No way! Fool, ya fool!

704
00:44:36,971 --> 00:44:40,849
You Jinchuriki don't exist
solely for yourselves!

705
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:43,222
You maintain the balance
of power between nations.

706
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:44,687
You are the strength of your village!

707
00:44:44,712 --> 00:44:47,423
To the nations and your village,
you are a special existence!

708
00:44:47,655 --> 00:44:49,991
You can't just do as you please!

709
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:53,399
You must understand
the circumstances, you fools!

710
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:56,110
Sure, that may be so...

711
00:44:56,235 --> 00:45:01,100
But I've got my personal feelings,
a spirit I can't abandon...

712
00:45:01,125 --> 00:45:03,627
Without that,
I'm just another weapon.

713
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:12,126
Why are you defending him, Bee?

714
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:14,837
We bumped fists...

715
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:20,008
But you still can't read
my heart, brother?

716
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:31,311
Doesn't seem like there's any
good prospects this time...

717
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:34,022
Listen up!

718
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:38,068
Only one of you is worthy enough
to inherit the title of "Bee."

719
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,603
Ay here is a candidate
to become the next Raikage!

720
00:45:42,214 --> 00:45:43,548
You all know that...

721
00:45:43,632 --> 00:45:45,175
Here in the Hidden Cloud,

722
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,410
each Raikage is assigned
a tag team partner.

723
00:45:49,261 --> 00:45:51,972
Someone who will bring out
the Raikage's full power.

724
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:56,170
And to be "Bee" is to be
the bodyguard of the Raikage.

725
00:45:57,463 --> 00:46:00,340
We'll now test your
compatibility with Ay.

726
00:46:00,797 --> 00:46:03,217
You will team up with Ay
and attempt to behead

727
00:46:03,242 --> 00:46:05,452
this rubber dummy
using the Double Lariat!

728
00:46:06,067 --> 00:46:11,306
Remember! To do this right, equal
strength must be applied from both sides!

729
00:46:12,184 --> 00:46:15,812
If one side is weaker or stronger,
it will only bend!

730
00:46:17,077 --> 00:46:18,828
First, bump fists with Ay and

731
00:46:18,853 --> 00:46:21,147
determine how much power
you should use.

732
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,239
Then execute the Double Lariat
on the dummy!

733
00:46:25,788 --> 00:46:28,123
All right!
We'll start from that end!

734
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:30,270
I'm honored, sir!

735
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:38,086
Next!

736
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:39,022
Yes sir!

737
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:41,632
Next.

738
00:46:41,885 --> 00:46:42,612
Yes sir...

739
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:46,470
Next!

740
00:46:46,635 --> 00:46:47,344
Right!

741
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:50,637
Next...

742
00:46:50,819 --> 00:46:51,820
– Yes, sir!
– Looks like we won't find

743
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:53,644
– anyone this time, either.

744
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:56,396
If he'd had a real sibling,

745
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:58,732
we wouldn't have had to go
through all this...

746
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,009
Next...

747
00:47:06,121 --> 00:47:07,706
L-Lord Raikage...

748
00:47:08,434 --> 00:47:10,144
It seems we found him.

749
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:23,507
You're kind of an odd one.
Bump fists with me again!

750
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:26,844
We're brothers from now on!

751
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:28,887
I'm counting on you, Bee!

752
00:47:35,965 --> 00:47:36,966
Let's go, Bee!

753
00:47:36,991 --> 00:47:40,453
Your plan suits me just fine.
We'll bump our fists every time.

754
00:47:40,478 --> 00:47:42,021
Okay, bro!

755
00:47:43,035 --> 00:47:44,361
Eat up!

756
00:47:44,597 --> 00:47:47,713
You have to get strong quickly
or our powers won't be in sync!

757
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,533
Okay, bro!

758
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,245
Our mission this time
is to recover a scroll.

759
00:47:54,262 --> 00:47:55,514
Don't tell me you're already...

760
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,749
Okay, brother!

761
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:03,431
Is he asleep?

762
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:04,598
Yeah...

763
00:48:05,318 --> 00:48:07,821
Bee is a good shinobi.
He's got talent too.

764
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:12,139
Although his rapping leaves
much to be desired...

765
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,474
I agree.

766
00:48:19,411 --> 00:48:20,904
Probably after me,

767
00:48:21,326 --> 00:48:23,495
this boy will become
the Jinchuriki of the Eight-Tails.

768
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:27,529
Is that what you've heard
from the elders?

769
00:48:28,323 --> 00:48:30,325
No... No one's told me anything yet.

770
00:48:31,983 --> 00:48:34,652
My old man, my uncle...
They all failed.

771
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:37,831
I'm not compatible either.

772
00:48:38,743 --> 00:48:41,457
Listen, as your cousin...

773
00:48:41,482 --> 00:48:43,799
But look, you have
the Eight-Tails under control...

774
00:48:44,056 --> 00:48:45,683
– Right now...
– Just listen!

775
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:50,427
Only those who are
Jinchuriki can understand.

776
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:54,890
Friends and acquaintances start
to look at you differently after.

777
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:59,269
Well, they probably think
they're treating you the same,

778
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:01,438
but you begin to see
that they're not.

779
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:02,731
There's no turning back.

780
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:04,524
You can only look
toward the future...

781
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:08,362
One that is filled with
darkness and loneliness.

782
00:49:09,111 --> 00:49:10,696
Have you really
achieved compatibility...?

783
00:49:11,011 --> 00:49:13,372
If you walk through life with the
shadow of your own death beside you?

784
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:17,412
It fills your mind
day in and day out...

785
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,790
and you begin to lose sight
of who you are.

786
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:22,876
You feel a hole in your heart.

787
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:27,589
And the Tailed Beast waits to
pounce on that weak heart and run wild.

788
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:32,442
When you live with
the constant fear of death,

789
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,221
you start wanting to die.

790
00:49:35,423 --> 00:49:37,217
But you have a knack for ninjutsu,

791
00:49:37,242 --> 00:49:39,203
you have the skill
and the ancestry...

792
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,436
You have everything
going for you!

793
00:49:42,121 --> 00:49:45,291
Yeah... That's exactly
the reasoning they used

794
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:49,194
when they chose me as
the Eight-Tails' Jinchuriki. But...

795
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:53,740
that's not what's essential
to become a Jinchuriki.

796
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,076
So what is it?

797
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:02,457
Having something that can
fill the void in your heart!

798
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:07,379
What is this "something"?

799
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:08,781
Just "something"!

800
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:13,427
If I can find it,
I feel I can stay strong.

801
00:50:14,977 --> 00:50:17,062
Let Bee find that something.

802
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:23,770
Another failure.

803
00:50:24,204 --> 00:50:26,748
This time, eight people
were victims of his rampage.

804
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:30,027
Because of the number of tails,

805
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:32,696
the Eight-Tails is that much harder
to control than the Two-Tails.

806
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:36,908
How long is this going to continue?

807
00:50:37,209 --> 00:50:39,419
The next Jinchuriki is
supposed to be...

808
00:50:40,033 --> 00:50:41,326
you know, that boy.

809
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,206
Such prestige, so immense...

810
00:50:43,231 --> 00:50:44,681
The Eight-Tails' name
gave you presence...

811
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,668
Now I offer you incense...

812
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:48,628
Whee!

813
00:50:49,334 --> 00:50:50,919
I don't think he'll make it...

814
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,388
Th-This kid...

815
00:50:58,388 --> 00:50:59,890
How could he do this
to our comrades?!

816
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:03,769
Treating us with such contempt!

817
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:05,771
Let's go, Bee!

818
00:51:06,701 --> 00:51:08,286
Okay, bro!

819
00:51:08,674 --> 00:51:10,468
Bee?! This brat?!

820
00:51:11,003 --> 00:51:13,505
So this means
you're the A/B Combo?

821
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:17,198
So you're familiar
with our technique?

822
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:21,578
D-Double Lariat?!

823
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:32,462
Bee, we still have a long way to go

824
00:51:32,487 --> 00:51:34,338
before the Double Lariat is perfect.

825
00:51:35,033 --> 00:51:37,744
I'm still holding back
to match your power.

826
00:51:38,455 --> 00:51:40,040
You have to become stronger!

827
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:45,207
I-I know! Fool, ya fool!

828
00:51:46,025 --> 00:51:48,819
How dare you call your
older brother a "fool"?!

829
00:51:49,149 --> 00:51:51,193
It's the Iron Claw for you!

830
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:54,111
I'll surpass you someday,
you'll see.

831
00:51:54,136 --> 00:51:56,471
On that day, I'll be carefree.

832
00:51:57,155 --> 00:52:00,450
The trick to this technique is
keeping both our powers equal.

833
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,786
So you have to come up to par!

834
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:09,709
That sounds ideal to me.
Talking down to you is my fantasy.

835
00:52:11,659 --> 00:52:14,284
You can fantasize after
you master the Lariat!

836
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:21,346
Tonight... we will seal
the Eight-Tails in Bee.

837
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:22,848
Right...

838
00:52:24,304 --> 00:52:26,848
<i>Having something that can fill
the void in your heart!</i>

839
00:52:28,003 --> 00:52:31,798
<i>If I can find it,
I feel I can stay strong.</i>

840
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:34,734
<i>Let Bee find that something.</i>

841
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:39,364
What is it, bro?

842
00:52:44,845 --> 00:52:47,181
You will now become a Jinchuriki.

843
00:52:48,021 --> 00:52:50,315
Things won't be the same anymore.

844
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:52,419
It will be extremely tough.

845
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:55,589
No kidding?
It's always been like that.

846
00:52:55,839 --> 00:53:00,135
I'll just give the octopus
a nickname as I rap.

847
00:53:07,931 --> 00:53:08,973
Listen up, Bee...

848
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:11,646
Always tell me everything, got it?

849
00:53:12,395 --> 00:53:14,814
You are special to me!

850
00:53:15,261 --> 00:53:17,388
We are the ultimate tag team.

851
00:53:33,296 --> 00:53:34,923
Even if he does have
the Iron Armor Seal,

852
00:53:35,018 --> 00:53:37,979
I wouldn't be surprised if
the Eight-Tails starts acting up.

853
00:53:38,486 --> 00:53:40,280
We'd better stay on it
and watch him.

854
00:53:40,887 --> 00:53:42,472
Wheee!

855
00:53:43,192 --> 00:53:46,404
The Eight-Tails is me,
the cool Killer Bee!

856
00:53:46,964 --> 00:53:48,423
Yay!

857
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,900
The blonde hair and
the Teleportation Jutsu!

858
00:53:57,261 --> 00:53:59,096
That's definitely
the Yellow Flash, right?!

859
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:01,529
Then we've have to
get out of here!

860
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:06,650
So he's the one who single-handedly
prevented the recovery of the Nine-Tails!

861
00:54:07,221 --> 00:54:12,293
And you are Unruly Ay, son of
the Hidden Cloud's Third Raikage.

862
00:54:13,398 --> 00:54:15,275
Rumors say that
you are extremely fast yourself.

863
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,423
Brother and me are gonna
get you, fool, ya fool!

864
00:54:21,158 --> 00:54:22,617
Everyone, stay out of this.

865
00:54:24,105 --> 00:54:25,106
I will take care of this!

866
00:54:35,034 --> 00:54:37,286
<i>He countered me at my top speed?</i>

867
00:54:39,751 --> 00:54:40,552
<i>What's this?</i>

868
00:54:42,989 --> 00:54:43,990
Forgive me, Bee.

869
00:54:44,255 --> 00:54:45,256
Are you all right?!

870
00:54:45,652 --> 00:54:46,402
No way...

871
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:49,667
Is he...
the Eight-Tails' Jinchuriki?!

872
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:53,832
It's the signal to evacuate!

873
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:54,499
Minato!

874
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:55,917
We'll retreat for now!

875
00:54:56,688 --> 00:54:58,398
This is child's play!

876
00:54:59,006 --> 00:55:02,009
Eight-Tails is the cool Killer Bee...
That's me!

877
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:05,343
You have amazing prowess.

878
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,804
Not as the Jinchuriki
of the Eight-Tails...

879
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:11,933
But as a shinobi, it seems you
possess something very powerful.

880
00:55:13,284 --> 00:55:15,375
He's got more natural talent
than me!

881
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:17,856
No, I don't mean that.

882
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,859
He possesses something
more precious.

883
00:55:21,206 --> 00:55:21,839
Huh?!

884
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:25,613
Ay... You have a fine family.

885
00:55:26,166 --> 00:55:27,167
As do I.

886
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:30,118
In any case,
the next time we meet...

887
00:55:30,305 --> 00:55:32,474
I suspect we'll be fighting
as one Kage against another.

888
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:35,765
If you don't figure out

889
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,543
what your little brother considers
most precious to him...

890
00:55:39,048 --> 00:55:41,717
he will be neither a Jinchuriki
nor a human.

891
00:55:44,115 --> 00:55:45,659
Don't try to fool me
with that nonsense!

892
00:55:45,684 --> 00:55:47,060
You are not getting away!

893
00:55:51,084 --> 00:55:53,712
<i>The Teleportation Jutsu goes
where the kunai are...</i>

894
00:55:54,153 --> 00:55:57,849
<i>I've marked the locations of all
his formula kunai.</i>

895
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:01,961
<i>If I can figure out
which one he'll pop up at,</i>

896
00:56:02,248 --> 00:56:03,708
<i>I can get him using
my top speed.</i>

897
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:09,407
I've got my own responsibilities...

898
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:11,451
<i>Go fly!</i>

899
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:13,995
<i>Now! Which kunai will it be?</i>

900
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,375
So I won't fail.

901
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:25,590
On the Eight-Tails' tentacles...

902
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,258
There's a Teleportation Jutsu Formula!

903
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:30,720
<i>Was that when...?</i>

904
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,523
Fine, let's do it, one on one.

905
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:43,525
We'll stab each other and be done!

906
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:47,695
You are my foe... but I like you.

907
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:50,490
You definitely got the moves
of a shinobi killer...

908
00:56:58,661 --> 00:56:59,746
<i>This is my chance!</i>

909
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:09,717
Damn it!

910
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:11,344
No doubt! He's fast!

911
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:15,723
<i>But... I'll try one more time!</i>

912
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:21,438
He's so fast, I can't track them!

913
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:34,492
Do you think you can beat me
with your Lariat?!

914
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:40,872
Octopops!

915
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:44,085
Instead of worrying about him,
you should worry about-

916
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:51,759
Why, Bee?!

917
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:56,181
Don't you get it yet, brother?
Fool, ya fool!

918
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:59,184
Thanks, Octopops!

919
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:02,604
No!

920
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:11,696
Hokage! You help too!

921
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:15,575
Lady Tsunade...

922
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:30,798
<i>Until I become Hokage,
there's no way...</i>

923
00:58:31,712 --> 00:58:33,214
<i>I'm going to die.</i>

924
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:37,222
Granny!

925
00:58:38,783 --> 00:58:40,034
Hokage!

926
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:43,311
You'd better have
a good excuse for this!

927
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:46,523
Even if you kill Naruto to
buy us some time

928
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:48,775
until the Nine-Tails comes back to life,

929
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:52,153
I can't see the next Jinchuriki
managing to control

930
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:54,030
the Nine-Tails' power,
to this degree!

931
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:57,283
Since we have no idea
which way this war will go,

932
00:58:57,682 --> 00:59:01,037
I say we use every weapon we've got,
and not hide the Jinchuriki!

933
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:03,164
I'm letting Naruto pass!

934
00:59:04,362 --> 00:59:05,994
Nice excuse!

935
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:08,378
I mean, now you're talking!

936
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:11,756
That's the Granny Hokage I know!

937
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:20,014
Hokage... Who's the one making
arbitrary decisions now?!

938
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:22,559
Each one of you...

939
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,353
What evidence do you have
that Naruto will succeed?!

940
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:32,610
I told you, your Lariat is too weak!

941
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:46,332
Bro, ever since you became
the Raikage,

942
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:50,397
you've underestimated my power,
fool, ya fool!

943
01:00:01,942 --> 01:00:05,654
No one ever expected
the Third Raikage to die...

944
01:00:10,352 --> 01:00:13,861
Where's bro?
Over there? Over here?

945
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:15,945
All of a sudden,

946
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:18,489
he started punching
his way out through the wall.

947
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:21,951
There should be a bunch of holes
in the walls now.

948
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:24,829
Follow them to find him.

949
01:00:26,056 --> 01:00:27,193
All right, will do...

950
01:00:27,218 --> 01:00:30,067
I'll look for bro beyond
the walls I go through.

951
01:00:35,871 --> 01:00:37,998
Hang in there, bro.

952
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:40,678
From today,
you're the Raikage, y'know.

953
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:43,640
I know that!

954
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:47,226
We're in the middle of a war!

955
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:49,562
As the Raikage,

956
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:51,606
I will protect this village and
this nation to the very end!

957
01:00:51,779 --> 01:00:53,427
That is what my old man wanted!

958
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:01,991
Bee! Starting today, you will go
to Unraikyo, the Cloud Thunder Ravine

959
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:04,160
to work on your Tailed Beast Bomb.

960
01:01:04,553 --> 01:01:06,722
You will not be engaging the enemy.

961
01:01:08,829 --> 01:01:10,519
But my Lariat...

962
01:01:10,544 --> 01:01:12,545
I don't need your Lariat anymore!

963
01:01:13,392 --> 01:01:16,145
If the enemy attacks the village,
you will stay and

964
01:01:16,254 --> 01:01:18,756
take them out with
your long-range Tailed Beast Bomb!

965
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:23,179
Remember! You are never to go
outside the village ever again!

966
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:33,690
Bee, you and Naruto
are precious Jinchuriki!

967
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:36,609
You are special to
your villages and nations.

968
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:39,320
That's why I'm saying you cannot go!

969
01:01:41,002 --> 01:01:43,380
No matter how powerful
a Jinchuriki is,

970
01:01:43,405 --> 01:01:49,745
the others have been captured
by the Akatsuki and sealed.

971
01:01:50,413 --> 01:01:53,332
We ain't going to lose, Naruto and me.

972
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:57,463
That I can personally guarantee.

973
01:01:58,005 --> 01:02:00,717
Fine, let's put it to the test!

974
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:05,179
My Lariat against yours!
We'll see who's stronger!

975
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:10,435
<i>Bee, we still have
a long way to go</i>

976
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:12,645
<i>before the Double Lariat is ideal.</i>

977
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:16,065
<i>Right now, I'm toning down
my power to match yours.</i>

978
01:02:16,505 --> 01:02:18,507
<i>You have to become stronger!</i>

979
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:24,532
<i>I'll surpass you some day, you'll see.
On that day, I'll be carefree.</i>

980
01:02:24,832 --> 01:02:31,005
<i>That sounds ideal to me.
Talking down to you is my fantasy.</i>

981
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:48,806
W-Wow...!

982
01:02:58,397 --> 01:02:59,774
See, with Naruto and me...

983
01:02:59,855 --> 01:03:02,316
it ain't just the power
of the Jinchuriki.

984
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:06,991
We have something
stronger fundamentally.

985
01:03:07,289 --> 01:03:10,375
Your words to me, and me alone,

986
01:03:10,518 --> 01:03:13,146
before I became the Eight-Tails...

987
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:17,902
They'll keep me strong, no matter
what, even when all else fails.

988
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:21,339
<i>Just "something"!</i>

989
01:03:21,997 --> 01:03:25,376
<i>If I'm able to find it, I feel as though
I can stay strong.</i>

990
01:03:27,325 --> 01:03:29,453
<i>Let Bee find that something.</i>

991
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:32,391
I see...

992
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:36,312
<i>You are special to me!</i>

993
01:03:36,465 --> 01:03:38,606
<i>We are the ultimate tag team!</i>

994
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:44,362
What I said that day...
at the Waterfall of Truth...?

995
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:48,032
So you finally understand,
fool, ya fool!

996
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:51,077
Preaching at you from above
is my fantasy.

997
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:54,413
The fantasy is now a reality, oh yeah!

998
01:03:57,232 --> 01:04:00,360
You are very special to me...

999
01:04:00,847 --> 01:04:05,299
I do not deny that I said,
"We are the ultimate tag team."

1000
01:04:05,926 --> 01:04:07,135
That's it?

1001
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:11,556
Just those words are enough
to keep you strong?

1002
01:04:12,431 --> 01:04:15,351
I don't just live and fight
for the village and nation.

1003
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:17,645
I live and fight for you too, bro!

1004
01:04:18,115 --> 01:04:21,744
Still you're way
too overprotective, bro.

1005
01:04:22,483 --> 01:04:25,570
And you're losing faith
in my strength, y'know.

1006
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:31,742
You lose a lot as a Jinchuriki...
I tell ya, the heart grows empty.

1007
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:37,623
But it made me see what's dear to hold
and now my heart is made of gold

1008
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,711
Tailed Beast power isn't
my foundation! Okay?!

1009
01:04:42,309 --> 01:04:43,588
Before the Tailed Beast
became my mate,

1010
01:04:43,629 --> 01:04:45,631
something inside me
had started to illuminate.

1011
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:48,946
I saw that it was
as big as the sun.

1012
01:04:49,425 --> 01:04:52,923
And that's my true power,
it's the one.

1013
01:04:54,954 --> 01:04:59,662
That's why I can keep
the Eight-Tails reined in.

1014
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:02,815
Naruto has the same sun deep within.

1015
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:06,777
And he has two of 'em, it's amazing.
Talk about a sensation.

1016
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:14,452
You're right...
It really is like the sun.

1017
01:05:14,602 --> 01:05:19,774
Naruto Uzumaki,
what are your two suns?

1018
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:25,504
My mom and dad!

1019
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:28,132
Your mother and father?

1020
01:05:28,927 --> 01:05:31,513
The Fourth Hokage and
Kushina Uzumaki?

1021
01:05:32,511 --> 01:05:36,307
But both of them died right
after you were born.

1022
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:41,771
When I was trying to
control Nine-Tails' power...

1023
01:05:41,945 --> 01:05:45,282
Dad made sure to let me
meet my mom.

1024
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,964
He sealed her chakra inside me,

1025
01:05:47,989 --> 01:05:50,463
so that if the Nine-Tails' seal
was undone,

1026
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:52,239
Mom would come and see me.

1027
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,825
He did it all for me!

1028
01:05:55,576 --> 01:05:57,662
<i>The Fourth Hokage studied</i>

1029
01:05:57,703 --> 01:06:01,165
<i>the unique Sealing jutsu
of the Uzumaki Clan...</i>

1030
01:06:01,368 --> 01:06:04,621
<i>And Kushina's chakra and
life force were powerful...</i>

1031
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:07,421
<i>It's possible.</i>

1032
01:06:08,547 --> 01:06:09,674
<i>Just as I thought.</i>

1033
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:14,303
When she gave me this power,
Mom told me everything.

1034
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:18,809
That long ago, dad fought with
the same guy with the mask...

1035
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:22,770
And he learned two things...

1036
01:06:23,627 --> 01:06:28,715
One was that this masked guy
would try to destroy the future.

1037
01:06:29,878 --> 01:06:31,755
And the other was that...

1038
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,656
The only one who could stop him

1039
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:38,619
was the Jinchuriki who controlled
the Nine-Tails... Me!

1040
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:42,623
<i>A masked man... Was it Madara?</i>

1041
01:06:43,777 --> 01:06:47,948
<i>So Madara caused that Nine-Tails'
incident in the Hidden Leaf?</i>

1042
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:51,757
<i>So the reason Minato sealed
the Nine-Tails in Naruto,</i>

1043
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:56,429
<i>and leaving the key...
it was for this purpose?!</i>

1044
01:06:57,096 --> 01:07:00,474
<i>He never did anything that
was unnecessary.</i>

1045
01:07:00,641 --> 01:07:04,228
<i>So he concluded that
this masked man, Madara,</i>

1046
01:07:04,469 --> 01:07:06,788
<i>posed an enormous threat to us.</i>

1047
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:11,652
<i>And that only the one who controlled
the Nine-Tails' power</i>

1048
01:07:11,798 --> 01:07:13,842
<i>had a chance of defeating him...</i>

1049
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:16,073
<i>So he chose Naruto...</i>

1050
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:20,703
Minato left everything to you?

1051
01:07:20,942 --> 01:07:23,485
He knew he wasn't the savior?

1052
01:07:26,401 --> 01:07:30,614
I don't know if dad ever considered
himself to be a savior or not.

1053
01:07:31,088 --> 01:07:34,759
But my master told me that
dad was the Child of Prophecy...

1054
01:07:35,036 --> 01:07:36,635
the savior.

1055
01:07:36,677 --> 01:07:38,888
Do you recall what
I told you earlier?

1056
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:41,807
That savior, Minato, is dead.

1057
01:07:42,683 --> 01:07:45,811
Don't you think that was a failure?

1058
01:07:50,430 --> 01:07:53,934
You're right. My dad died.

1059
01:07:54,725 --> 01:07:58,395
He died along with my mom,
trying to protect Konoha

1060
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:00,493
from the enemy and the Nine-Tails!

1061
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:02,078
Trying to protect me!

1062
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:04,972
It only lasted a moment...

1063
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:07,333
But at that moment,
they gave me something.

1064
01:08:07,381 --> 01:08:09,383
They gave me the belief that

1065
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:13,172
I am capable of lots and
lots and lots of things!

1066
01:08:13,605 --> 01:08:15,733
And they entrusted me to
be the savior of the world!

1067
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:18,636
Raikage!

1068
01:08:19,597 --> 01:08:23,059
If you kill Naruto to buy time,

1069
01:08:23,295 --> 01:08:25,881
then the Nine-Tails will just
end up being taken anyway!

1070
01:08:26,173 --> 01:08:27,967
And it will definitely spell
the end of the world!

1071
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:31,190
Only Naruto can control
the Nine-Tails' power.

1072
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:33,567
Just as Minato believed!

1073
01:08:34,151 --> 01:08:38,280
Letting Naruto go is the way to
protect shinobi, and everyone!

1074
01:08:38,697 --> 01:08:40,366
My bet is on Naruto!

1075
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:42,034
So what is your decision?!

1076
01:08:42,905 --> 01:08:45,741
Let me go too, fool, ya fool!

1077
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:49,792
Like you always said,
I'm a big fool too.

1078
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:54,838
And Naruto here is just like me...
Don't you agree?

1079
01:08:55,339 --> 01:08:57,633
But to succeed, you need
fools like us

1080
01:08:57,633 --> 01:09:01,929
who don't care at all
how big or strong the wall!

1081
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:03,222
Yahoo!

1082
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:20,656
Bro's at top speed,
you can't go much faster!

1083
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:23,909
He really means to kill Naruto...
This is gonna be a disaster!

1084
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:31,834
As always, you're so stubborn.
I have no choice, but to join in!

1085
01:09:32,918 --> 01:09:35,963
<i>I can't involve Granny in this!</i>

1086
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:46,265
Here I come, Naruto!

1087
01:09:46,665 --> 01:09:50,002
A lot of people have
put their trust in me.

1088
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:03,240
I won't fail!

1089
01:10:08,473 --> 01:10:09,722
<i>He dodged it?!</i>

1090
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:13,209
<i>Fool, ya fool! He really is...</i>

1091
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:16,003
<i>... just like the Yellow Flash!</i>

1092
01:10:16,999 --> 01:10:19,251
You're right, Raikage...

1093
01:10:19,561 --> 01:10:22,731
If I fail, I won't be a savior.

1094
01:10:23,802 --> 01:10:28,766
So I will not fail!
Just like my Dad didn't.

1095
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:36,482
Just like my dad, the savior, did it!

1096
01:10:39,565 --> 01:10:41,608
I just wanted to see for myself...

1097
01:10:42,112 --> 01:10:44,198
So I came at you, with intent to kill.

1098
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:48,369
You're only the second one
to ever outrun my fastest punch.

1099
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:54,541
It seems the savior is alive...
within you.

1100
01:10:57,169 --> 01:10:58,420
Now go.

1101
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:00,052
Right!

1102
01:11:09,117 --> 01:11:11,258
<i>The long night is finally
coming to an end.</i>

1103
01:11:14,993 --> 01:11:17,796
<i>They should be able to
use their eyes now.</i>

1104
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:23,041
<i>New Pains of the Six Paths
using Jinchuriki.</i>

1105
01:11:23,866 --> 01:11:26,869
<i>I've just added a little something...</i>

1106
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:41,242
If Kisame's intel is correct,
Naruto now has the same ability,

1107
01:11:41,267 --> 01:11:44,402
just like Mito Uzumaki,
the wife of the First Hokage,

1108
01:11:44,427 --> 01:11:47,169
to sense the enemy.

1109
01:11:48,606 --> 01:11:51,108
Naruto will have no choice.

1110
01:11:51,622 --> 01:11:54,166
He'll have to battle
with White Zetsu.

1111
01:11:55,526 --> 01:11:57,194
It's all going according to plan...

1112
01:11:57,343 --> 01:12:00,429
Today, the Senju's Will of Fire
shall be extinguished.
