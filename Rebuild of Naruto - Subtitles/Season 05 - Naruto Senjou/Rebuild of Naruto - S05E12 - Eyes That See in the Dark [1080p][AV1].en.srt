1
00:00:05,709 --> 00:00:07,336
<i>Stone Golem!</i>

2
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,562
It will pulverize him!

3
00:00:16,435 --> 00:00:17,276
<i>Wood Style:</i>

4
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:21,980
<i>Deep Forest Bloom!</i>

5
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,490
Damn you!

6
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:43,960
<i>As expected...</i>

7
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:49,340
It's coming closer...
What should we do?!

8
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,762
That's... Grandfather's...!

9
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:55,138
Kazekage!

10
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,386
I know!

11
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:08,691
What is it?

12
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,945
Look at the scale of that!

13
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:13,605
To create a forest in an instant!

14
00:01:14,746 --> 00:01:16,748
Everyone, beware of the pollen!

15
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,328
Do not inhale it!

16
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,290
<i>Not just Deep Forest Emergence...</i>

17
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,875
<i>but Deep Forest Bloom as well?</i>

18
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,668
<i>How dare that Kabuto!</i>

19
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:33,460
<i>There is no shinobi alive today</i>

20
00:01:33,485 --> 00:01:36,655
<i>who is as powerful as the First Hokage,
Hashirama Senju.</i>

21
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,224
<i>Everyone says that.</i>

22
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,935
<i>Just as they think that</i>

23
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:45,939
<i>the Sage of the Six Paths' power
was also a fairy tale.</i>

24
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:51,778
<i>It's time to show them that
all the fairy tales were real!</i>

25
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,200
Wait, you bastard!

26
00:02:04,529 --> 00:02:06,615
You were too distracted by the flowers...

27
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,837
N-No! Raikage!

28
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:21,698
Humph... Time to burn things up...

29
00:02:21,926 --> 00:02:24,511
<i>Fire Style: Majestic Demolisher!</i>

30
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,776
Mizukage!

31
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,738
Water... Style...

32
00:02:49,221 --> 00:02:54,184
<i>I guess I am too old...
to do anything!</i>

33
00:04:36,346 --> 00:04:38,681
Look, the left side is dirty!

34
00:04:38,706 --> 00:04:41,209
That's a precious rock of the Hidden Stone!

35
00:04:41,234 --> 00:04:43,778
Polish it more evenly!

36
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,828
You need to put more spirit
into your polishing!

37
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,998
<i>His puns kill me...</i>

38
00:04:50,476 --> 00:04:51,374
Hmm?

39
00:04:52,688 --> 00:04:58,236
I don't know if it's a symbol of our village
or not, but it's just a plain old rock.

40
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,691
If we carved Stone Faces like the Hidden Leaf,
it would actually look impressive...

41
00:05:02,716 --> 00:05:05,511
But our Lord Tsuchikage is such a cheapskate!

42
00:05:05,995 --> 00:05:11,998
Ohnoki... I can tell the value of
a stone just by looking at it.

43
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:17,108
This rock...
symbolizes our village's Will of Stone!

44
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,901
It's our bedrock!

45
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:23,381
Don't be so cheap! And stop
using our symbol for your puns!

46
00:05:23,595 --> 00:05:24,782
Well...

47
00:05:24,986 --> 00:05:27,447
You're right.
This is just an ordinary rock.

48
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,538
Whaaaaaat?!

49
00:05:32,157 --> 00:05:35,547
Wh-What's are you doing?
You stupid old man!

50
00:05:35,572 --> 00:05:37,282
I can't tell which one it is now!

51
00:05:37,307 --> 00:05:43,050
See... if you put a new one
here like this, no one would know.

52
00:05:43,075 --> 00:05:44,201
What?!

53
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,889
What's important is
the Will of Stone inside you...

54
00:05:50,226 --> 00:05:56,689
You see, I can also tell the worth
of someone's will just by looking at them.

55
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,983
Ohnoki...

56
00:05:59,346 --> 00:06:03,571
Hidden within your will is
the power to change the world.

57
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,783
But if you're not careful,

58
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,872
that precious will of yours
may disappear...

59
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:12,955
Disappear?

60
00:06:28,497 --> 00:06:29,645
Why?!

61
00:06:31,556 --> 00:06:34,017
That's not the agreement!
Lord Hashirama said...

62
00:06:34,224 --> 00:06:35,809
There is no alliance.

63
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,648
Just obey the Hidden Leaf!

64
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:41,359
And...

65
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,078
Never mention that shinobi's name
before me again!

66
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,116
<i>Susano'o!</i>

67
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:01,462
<i>Barriers! As you keep
running into barriers,</i>

68
00:07:01,609 --> 00:07:03,736
<i>you may abandon your will...</i>

69
00:07:04,164 --> 00:07:08,778
<i>make excuses and even
replace it with hatred.</i>

70
00:07:09,031 --> 00:07:11,575
<i>Listen closely, your will...</i>

71
00:07:12,512 --> 00:07:16,224
<i>Never abandon it and
always stride with pride!</i>

72
00:07:36,711 --> 00:07:38,958
Seems you still want to keep dancing...

73
00:07:40,235 --> 00:07:42,858
But there's no strength left in your step!

74
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,779
I'm making excuses...

75
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:18,039
<i>Particle Style:
Atomic Dismantling Jutsu!</i>

76
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,294
Look at me being pitiful about my age...

77
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:39,143
I should be excused...
for making an excuse!

78
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:49,987
What's this?

79
00:08:50,678 --> 00:08:51,697
Ohnoki!

80
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,192
You're all awake!

81
00:08:54,217 --> 00:08:55,344
All right!

82
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,371
Let's get on with our counterattack!

83
00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:00,708
There he is!

84
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:07,254
You dance well.

85
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:16,222
But your step is still too weak.

86
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,976
That... looks like
the First Hokage's face!

87
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,814
I didn't want to believe it, but...

88
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,024
That's why he's able to
use the Wood Style!

89
00:09:30,343 --> 00:09:34,949
<i>And this is far different from what
Lord Orochimaru developed with Danzo.</i>

90
00:09:35,372 --> 00:09:38,458
<i>The First Hokage was more
powerful than Madara.</i>

91
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:43,958
<i>This fusion of both will be
my ultimate weapon.</i>

92
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:48,738
<i>No one can stop
this Reanimation!</i>

93
00:09:50,543 --> 00:09:52,920
You there... woman,
user of the medical ninjutsu...

94
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:58,347
You have his blood running
through your veins, don't you?

95
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:00,850
And what of it?!

96
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,104
I'll bring you down first.

97
00:10:07,071 --> 00:10:10,366
Taking out a unit's medic ninja
first is an established tactic.

98
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:15,948
Surely, you don't think we'd
let you do that so easily, do you?

99
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:17,992
You're wrong...

100
00:10:18,968 --> 00:10:22,930
It's because she's a descendant
of Hashirama Senju.

101
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,740
Your medical ninjutsu
is only strong enough

102
00:10:28,765 --> 00:10:32,311
to defer death only
for a short while.

103
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:38,780
Compared to Hashirama Senju,
your jutsu is trivial.

104
00:10:42,954 --> 00:10:47,792
He was able to heal without
even weaving signs.

105
00:10:48,102 --> 00:10:50,354
He was in another class
in every jutsu.

106
00:10:51,185 --> 00:10:54,480
Everyone called him
the most powerful shinobi.

107
00:10:56,947 --> 00:11:00,910
I fought a real death match
against him...

108
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:04,121
This is child's play.

109
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:18,386
Compared to him, what do you,
his descendant, have to offer?

110
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,764
You can't even use the Wood Style...

111
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:25,209
Your medical ninjutsu
doesn't even come close.

112
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:29,355
And most of all,
you're a weak woman!

113
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,693
Weakness disgusts me.

114
00:11:34,187 --> 00:11:36,648
And a weak Senju disgusts me
even more!

115
00:11:37,187 --> 00:11:40,232
You've gone on long enough!

116
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,121
I am a descendant of
the first Hokage Hashirama...

117
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,957
And true,
I don't use the Wood Style.

118
00:11:48,924 --> 00:11:51,836
My medical ninjutsu is pathetic
compared to the First's,

119
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,213
who didn't even
have to weave signs!

120
00:11:55,058 --> 00:11:57,310
And I am a woman...

121
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,220
But not a weak woman.

122
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,850
Simple strength isn't everything.

123
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,811
It's something passed on to me,

124
00:12:09,014 --> 00:12:10,849
and continues to flow
from the First Hokage.

125
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,304
That is my true power!

126
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:23,033
You think you can beat me
with Hashirama's will?

127
00:12:23,454 --> 00:12:25,414
Power is not will.

128
00:12:25,439 --> 00:12:27,900
Power is only the ability
to make things happen.

129
00:12:28,308 --> 00:12:29,351
You're wrong!

130
00:12:29,376 --> 00:12:32,170
The will of the dead
shows its power

131
00:12:32,277 --> 00:12:33,737
in those they left behind!

132
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,173
I used that will to develop
my medical ninjutsu.

133
00:12:37,353 --> 00:12:39,813
From there, medic ninja and
Medical Laws were established!

134
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,846
Rule One! A medic ninja must
never give up on treatment

135
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,724
until their patient's dying breath.

136
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:51,228
Rule Two! A medic ninja must
never go to the frontlines!

137
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,938
Rule Three!

138
00:12:53,008 --> 00:12:56,844
A medic ninja should always be
the last of their squad to die!

139
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,488
This is what I teach my students.

140
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:04,283
But there is actually
one more rule...

141
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,288
Rule Four!

142
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,040
A medic ninja who masters

143
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:14,210
the Ninja Art of Mitotic Regeneration,
the 100 Healings...

144
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,378
may break the first three rules!

145
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,799
The 100 Healings Jutsu?

146
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,967
I've never heard of it.

147
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,887
It's a Forbidden Jutsu that
applies only to me.

148
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,623
Which means,

149
00:13:26,648 --> 00:13:28,609
I am the only medic ninja
allowed to battle!

150
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,982
The Particle Style Jutsu may
have dissipated the pollen...

151
00:13:32,007 --> 00:13:34,371
But adding one medic ninja
won't make any difference...

152
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,690
Four wasn't working,
so we'll try five!

153
00:13:37,261 --> 00:13:39,893
Don't you dare think
I'm an ordinary medic ninja!

154
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,700
<i>She's not as fast as the Raikage...</i>

155
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:47,743
Let's go!

156
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:55,605
<i>But her power is greater than his!</i>

157
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,586
<i>Fire Style:</i>

158
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,421
<i>Majestic Demolisher Flame!</i>

159
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,967
<i>Water Style: Water Pillar!</i>

160
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,887
<i>Water Style:
Water Dragon Missile!</i>

161
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:10,724
<i>Weighted Boulder!</i>

162
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,727
<i>Lateral Bolt of Pain! Chop!</i>

163
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:29,869
I admit...
You're not weak, woman.

164
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:31,620
However...

165
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,748
If you step in and die here,

166
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,709
all the other Kage will die.

167
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,546
Since you're the only one
who can heal them.

168
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,252
That's if I die.

169
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,219
Hashirama...

170
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,889
I don't know what
you left behind...

171
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,100
But this falls far short
of your abilities.

172
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,561
If you were going to let
your underlings take over,

173
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:59,148
you should have taught them
how to resurrect you too...

174
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:06,155
All that's left of you is the life
force of your cells that cling to me.

175
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:12,202
All that's left of
my little brother is

176
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,080
the visual prowess of his eyes,
which are now mine.

177
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,665
That's why...

178
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,836
I said you're wrong!

179
00:15:22,813 --> 00:15:25,649
The only thing that is
passed down...

180
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,087
is hatred.

181
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,641
<i>You're already dead!</i>

182
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:37,603
<i>So don't spread any more hate!</i>

183
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,356
Kazekage! Now!

184
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,450
<i>Grand Sand Mausoleum!</i>

185
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:56,664
He's been sealed!

186
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,207
All right!

187
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,493
The one you sealed away
is a Wood Style Clone

188
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,436
that Hashirama used to use.

189
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,313
It is well-made...

190
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:25,842
My visual prowess made me the only shinobi
who was able to see the ruse...

191
00:16:26,857 --> 00:16:28,696
in the past.

192
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:31,991
Now then...

193
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,994
It's over for the rest of you Kage...

194
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,730
How can you move?

195
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:07,651
Like I told you, I'm different!

196
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,823
Regeneration without weaving signs...

197
00:17:13,338 --> 00:17:19,204
So that's the real power of your jutsu
mentioned in Rule Four.

198
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,620
It's just like Hashirama's power.

199
00:17:23,181 --> 00:17:26,601
I wanted to catch you off guard
with this, but...

200
00:17:27,184 --> 00:17:29,937
You can't kill me with
my own jutsu.

201
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,196
<i>I can kill you, with my jutsu!</i>

202
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,873
Have you gone senile, Ohnoki?

203
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,850
The Rinnegan can absorb
all jutsu.

204
00:17:40,502 --> 00:17:43,631
Ninjutsu like that will
not work against me!

205
00:17:43,956 --> 00:17:47,775
To kill me, you need to hit me
hard physically and seal me.

206
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,735
You know that.

207
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,072
My Particle Style grazed
your chest earlier...

208
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,825
There's no way that the Atomic
Dismantling Jutsu failed!

209
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,368
Oh that...

210
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,915
I just wanted to show you
all Hashirama's face.

211
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:07,211
I wanted to reduce your morale...

212
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,798
But it seems it had the opposite effect...
It boosted your morale instead.

213
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,092
Let me ask you a question.

214
00:18:15,058 --> 00:18:17,071
While it doesn't change the fact

215
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,598
that you outwitted us with
the Wood Style Clone...

216
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,350
But from another angle,

217
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:24,061
you could say we managed
to corner you

218
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:26,527
into having to substitute
a clone for yourself.

219
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:27,864
Am I wrong?

220
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,701
It is five against one, after all...

221
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,913
Even if it is five-to-one,
we must win, no matter what.

222
00:18:42,938 --> 00:18:44,690
Don't call it unfair!

223
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:48,919
In truth, it is a testament
to your might!

224
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,839
You are Madara Uchiha!

225
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,757
It's not unfair.

226
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,363
Five-to-one... It's just the right ratio
for playing games.

227
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,109
Now it's five-to-one.

228
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,944
Don't say this is unfair.

229
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,029
You are the Five Kage.

230
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,950
So now I've got
a question for you...

231
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:25,080
Would you like these clones
to use Susano'o or not?

232
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,790
Your choice.

233
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,178
Answer me.

234
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:42,514
Would you like these clones
to use Susano'o or not?

235
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:43,557
Your choice.

236
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:49,188
The likes of you have no answer.

237
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,985
Well, I'll answer for you.

238
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,576
Impossible...

239
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,994
T-There are so many...

240
00:20:11,846 --> 00:20:13,264
They'll use it.

241
00:20:17,976 --> 00:20:18,977
This guy...

242
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:21,050
Five against one for each of us?

243
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,763
Let's go!

244
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,487
The Five Kage are struggling
against Madara.

245
00:20:39,127 --> 00:20:40,420
There's unbelievable chakra!

246
00:20:41,068 --> 00:20:44,488
He's not just a legendary shinobi...
He's been reanimated.

247
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,247
He's immortal,
so he has infinite chakra.

248
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,625
It's no wonder the Five Kage
are having a hard time.

249
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:55,170
We must do something about
the user of this Reanimation Jutsu.

250
00:20:55,581 --> 00:20:57,291
Any word from the Investigative Unit?

251
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:02,302
Nothing. They've been searching
every spot thought to be a hideout.

252
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,389
And not one sign of Kabuto.

253
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:06,556
And the Sensory Unit?

254
00:21:07,135 --> 00:21:09,137
We're getting no response.

255
00:21:10,126 --> 00:21:12,294
He's probably put up a barrier.

256
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,314
Shall I send out more shinobi?

257
00:21:14,739 --> 00:21:16,491
We've sent every man available.

258
00:21:16,948 --> 00:21:18,992
Anymore will weaken the front.

259
00:21:21,804 --> 00:21:24,306
Who would have imagined that
Kabuto could do so much?

260
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,181
They're too strong!

261
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:50,996
How are we supposed to...?

262
00:21:52,155 --> 00:21:54,736
You're right. At this rate...

263
00:22:02,817 --> 00:22:05,820
Hokage, your fighting
is getting sloppy!

264
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,859
It might not kill you, but keep fighting
like that and you'll only exhaust yourself.

265
00:22:11,884 --> 00:22:13,928
I'm putting my life on the line
for this battle!

266
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,126
There is no other way!

267
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,212
Hokage!

268
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,179
<i>No...</i>

269
00:22:26,472 --> 00:22:28,891
<i>Damn! How could I...</i>

270
00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:32,164
<i>have fallen prey to
Sharingan genjutsu?</i>

271
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,033
<i>Release!</i>

272
00:22:48,878 --> 00:22:50,380
Thanks, Tsuchikage.

273
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,788
Damn that Ohnoki...

274
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,832
His wisdom in battle is
beginning to show...

275
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:59,815
<i>He stopped Susano'o with
the Weighted Boulder Jutsu...</i>

276
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,800
<i>and saved the Raikage.</i>

277
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,549
Stand, my fellow Kage!

278
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,488
No more weakness!

279
00:23:06,513 --> 00:23:08,207
Let us look death in
the face together!

280
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,625
We are the Five Kage!

281
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:17,279
So choose final words that
will not shame your title!

282
00:23:18,127 --> 00:23:20,964
Remember the battle that
we entrusted to Naruto!

283
00:23:21,613 --> 00:23:26,726
He entrusted this battle to us and we
swore that we would win, no matter what!

284
00:23:27,582 --> 00:23:29,084
And there is one more thing...

285
00:23:29,695 --> 00:23:33,699
We cannot betray the trust of
each and every shinobi.

286
00:23:40,215 --> 00:23:43,218
We must be worthy
of the title of Kage!

287
00:23:51,504 --> 00:23:54,865
So the problem is...
Ohnoki, after all.

288
00:23:55,258 --> 00:23:57,927
<i>I have no choice
but to break his will.</i>

289
00:23:59,348 --> 00:24:01,016
More, Princess!

290
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,525
You don't have to tell me!

291
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:05,819
There's not much chakra left!

292
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,196
We must consider this
our last stand.

293
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,367
<i>Particle Style:
Boundary Dismantling Jutsu!</i>

294
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:21,629
<i>Releasing Susano'o kept me
from absorbing the Particle Style...</i>

295
00:24:27,756 --> 00:24:30,884
I told you the only thing that will
work against me are physical attacks.

296
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:36,308
<i>You think you've eliminated the clones,
and distracted me with the Particle Style?</i>

297
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:44,024
It's not just sand!

298
00:24:48,459 --> 00:24:51,628
<i>If you don't like the sand,
just stop absorbing the jutsu!</i>

299
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:56,328
<i>But then, the Lightning Water Dragon
will paralyze you.</i>

300
00:24:57,072 --> 00:24:59,741
<i>And I'll use that moment to
wedge him in with my Particle Style!</i>

301
00:24:59,852 --> 00:25:03,147
<i>That will give us enough time
to seal him away!</i>

302
00:25:03,861 --> 00:25:04,862
Do you see this?

303
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:08,048
This is the full power
of the Five Kage!

304
00:25:08,313 --> 00:25:09,689
<i>I see...</i>

305
00:25:10,173 --> 00:25:13,927
<i>This truly is worthy of the shinobi
who bear the name Kage.</i>

306
00:25:14,594 --> 00:25:18,890
<i>Then I, Madara Uchiha,
shall also respond with full power!</i>

307
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:25,688
The Five Kage are nothing
compared to me.

308
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:32,809
This is...

309
00:25:33,193 --> 00:25:35,487
my Perfect Susano'o!

310
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:42,290
It's massive.

311
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,258
Is this...

312
00:25:52,278 --> 00:25:54,029
the True Susano'o?

313
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,351
Not quite yet...

314
00:25:58,533 --> 00:25:59,534
Settle down!

315
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,248
The big one's chakra
has settled down...

316
00:26:25,537 --> 00:26:27,330
I can't believe the difference
in power...

317
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,297
I can't believe Grandfather
fought someone like him!

318
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,842
I already told you...

319
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,303
Hashirama was the only one
who could stop me.

320
00:26:36,391 --> 00:26:39,394
But he's no longer here.

321
00:26:41,128 --> 00:26:45,925
Though you could say that
actually works in your favor.

322
00:26:46,667 --> 00:26:48,002
That's because...

323
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,891
It's just me...

324
00:27:23,627 --> 00:27:27,131
so the maps will only need
to be redrawn a little.

325
00:27:28,315 --> 00:27:31,693
Impossible! He split the mountain!

326
00:27:32,723 --> 00:27:35,601
This is... Madara Uchiha...

327
00:27:36,797 --> 00:27:39,133
Then why back then...?

328
00:27:47,429 --> 00:27:49,640
Why did you hold back against us?

329
00:27:50,691 --> 00:27:53,861
What adult goes full force
when fighting mere children?

330
00:27:54,104 --> 00:27:57,273
Besides... Are you finished now?

331
00:28:05,967 --> 00:28:09,470
We may be stumbling in the dark,

332
00:28:09,495 --> 00:28:12,331
but we're close to the light
at the end of the tunnel!

333
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,694
Here, of all places...

334
00:28:19,513 --> 00:28:22,307
This Susano'o is destruction incarnate.

335
00:28:23,114 --> 00:28:25,381
A single stroke of the blade
contains enough power

336
00:28:25,406 --> 00:28:27,408
to smash all things in this universe.

337
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:30,500
It rivals even the Tailed Beasts!

338
00:28:31,137 --> 00:28:33,264
Take your philosophy, Five Kage,

339
00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:35,624
and be crushed and be gone!

340
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:45,890
I see...

341
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,352
Lots and lots of shinobi?

342
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:52,564
According to these birds...

343
00:28:52,589 --> 00:28:54,215
It's a war, right?

344
00:28:57,652 --> 00:29:01,906
We should find Sasuke before
we get mixed up in this war.

345
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:08,304
You're so handsome!

346
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:15,587
But how dare you try to kill me!

347
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,547
Why that—!

348
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,722
Idiot! But I still want you!

349
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:33,021
No... He tried to kill me!
No forgiveness!

350
00:29:33,046 --> 00:29:34,715
But he's so handsome!

351
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,066
What has she been doing?!

352
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:39,402
It's a hand-drawn picture.

353
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:43,281
She keeps talking to it.
Poor thing...

354
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,075
She must've gone through hell.

355
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:48,995
Oh... that picture of Sasuke?

356
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:54,068
Aren't we supposed
to confiscate that?

357
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,988
I tried to.
That's when she went nuts.

358
00:29:58,693 --> 00:30:00,945
She'll stay calm if
we let her keep it.

359
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,343
It's just a picture. That's all.

360
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:07,514
Okay then, why don't we play
a nice, quiet game of cards?

361
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:08,765
Sure.

362
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,582
It'd be great if Sasuke
were here at this hideout.

363
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:38,044
This place is special, after all.

364
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,130
Orochimaru's favorite spot.

365
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:48,429
Hey, Sasuke... Are you here?

366
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,315
The size of this hideout
is ridiculous.

367
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,071
What's wrong?

368
00:31:05,898 --> 00:31:08,776
Nothing. My head just started hurting.

369
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:12,745
<i>Is he going to go on
a rampage again?</i>

370
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,772
<i>Sasuke, Karin and Jugo...</i>

371
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,001
<i>Hebi, Taka or whatever...</i>

372
00:31:18,254 --> 00:31:21,062
<i>I'm the only normal one among us.</i>

373
00:31:21,191 --> 00:31:22,401
Suigetsu...

374
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:23,631
What is it?

375
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,968
Something's always bothered me
about you.

376
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,511
Oh yeah?!

377
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,670
Well, I'm always concerned
about you.

378
00:31:30,695 --> 00:31:32,197
You keep me on pins and needles.

379
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:35,393
I'm here because I made
a promise to Kimimaro.

380
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,353
Why are you here?

381
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:40,023
Are you in Team Taka just to
cause trouble with Sasuke and Karin?

382
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,232
Why?

383
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,484
Yeah, why?

384
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:49,282
I would love to break those
two losers up for good!

385
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,367
I can't help it!

386
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:55,999
I just want to break everything in two!

387
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:59,292
You really are the worst,
you know that?

388
00:32:02,122 --> 00:32:06,543
On that scale,
Sasuke is the worst of all.

389
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,218
I hate all of you!

390
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:11,496
I lead you idiots to water,

391
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,015
and you just splash it in
my face instead of drinking it.

392
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,266
That's why...

393
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:26,486
I hate you most of all!

394
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:31,824
Huh?!

395
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:34,994
This is...

396
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,664
I've been here lots of times...

397
00:32:38,201 --> 00:32:39,327
I never knew this existed.

398
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:45,252
Is this one of...
Orochimaru's secret rooms?

399
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:57,934
Huh?

400
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,151
<i>What?</i>

401
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:11,572
<i>This is... Orochimaru planned
all of this?</i>

402
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:16,911
<i>If so, this intel could change
the outcome of this entire war!</i>

403
00:33:19,508 --> 00:33:22,803
This might be a very nice present
for Sasuke.

404
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:26,546
We found something incredible
by chance!

405
00:33:29,595 --> 00:33:32,348
Jugo... that punch is
water under the bridge...

406
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,600
Snap out of it, Jugo.

407
00:33:40,401 --> 00:33:42,278
We've got to find Sasuke quick!

408
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,448
You didn't waste any time
coming after me.

409
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:55,491
What are you doing here?!

410
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,410
Or not... it seems...

411
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,999
I passed by two towns
on my way here,

412
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,625
but they were deserted.

413
00:34:05,089 --> 00:34:07,383
I thought something
wasn't quite right outside.

414
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:08,880
Do you know anything about it?

415
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:10,757
We asked you a question first!

416
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,695
How come you're outside?!

417
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,806
What happened to the one of us
that was with you?

418
00:34:15,927 --> 00:34:18,412
If you don't like the fact
that I'm out,

419
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,183
why don't you catch me?

420
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,560
Especially since you
outnumber me this time.

421
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,730
You didn't kill our original,
did you?!

422
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:27,558
With this many of you,

423
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:29,669
I hope it's more of
a challenge this time.

424
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,242
<i>Susano'o!</i>

425
00:34:57,589 --> 00:34:58,882
<i>Sharingan!</i>

426
00:35:00,851 --> 00:35:02,227
It's a war...

427
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:06,145
Take down the enemy.

428
00:35:06,496 --> 00:35:09,249
Looks like Madara's started things.

429
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:15,238
Capture Killer Bee and
Naruto Uzumaki.

430
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:19,200
If you don't hurry...

431
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:22,161
More and more of his friends
will join up with him...

432
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,996
one after another.

433
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:29,043
<i>You're someone who knows
the pain of solitude like I do.</i>

434
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:32,547
<i>And that pain makes people stronger.</i>

435
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:35,341
<i>And for that very reason,
by cutting that bond,</i>

436
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,677
<i>I will be able to obtain
even greater strength.</i>

437
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,263
Have you forgotten, Naruto...

438
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,723
What real power is?

439
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:54,277
I'm going to where you are...

440
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,071
To cut you down.

441
00:36:02,816 --> 00:36:05,402
You're not Hidden Leaf shinobi.

442
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:07,707
You're not part of the promise.

443
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,981
These are good eyes.

444
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,216
I'm quickly getting used
to them, brother.

445
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:22,180
<i>When you have the same eyes
as me, come before me.</i>

446
00:36:23,405 --> 00:36:27,326
<i>The scenes burned into these eyes...
that once belonged to my brother...</i>

447
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:31,314
<i>are disgustingly sad...
They weigh me down.</i>

448
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:36,652
<i>But that's only fitting.
Just you watch, brother!</i>

449
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,318
Wait!

450
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,280
Is that you, Itachi?!

451
00:37:24,528 --> 00:37:26,488
I said... wait!

452
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,001
This Susano'o...

453
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,087
So you are Itachi!

454
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:42,093
I'm surprised that you've been
able to master it too...

455
00:37:43,388 --> 00:37:45,182
What are you doing here?!

456
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,806
You're supposed to be dead!

457
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,225
This is Kabuto's jutsu...

458
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,766
I am reanimated now.

459
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:58,109
I can't stop now.
There's something I have to do.

460
00:37:58,643 --> 00:37:59,978
I don't care!

461
00:38:00,417 --> 00:38:05,172
You're here before me and
I have a lot of questions!

462
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:09,120
Ask me later... But I guess
that's not going to happen.

463
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:11,400
You said so yourself!

464
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,667
To come find you once
I had the same eyes as you!

465
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,794
So why are you running?

466
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,171
To avoid admitting
that you lied to me?!

467
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:22,273
Or don't you have
the courage to tell the truth?!

468
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:27,263
I already know...
everything about you!

469
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:31,225
That's why I decided to destroy
the Hidden Leaf!

470
00:38:32,163 --> 00:38:34,582
I told you when we fought...

471
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:39,025
That people live
under false assumptions...

472
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:41,527
I asked if you could think
about it that way.

473
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:46,115
And how one's reality
might be an illusion.

474
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,277
Is my truth really—

475
00:38:49,302 --> 00:38:51,596
I no longer live
inside an illusion!

476
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:53,914
And I can see through
your genjutsu!

477
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,376
These are your eyes!

478
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,089
You're as confident as ever,

479
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:05,092
but I've heard about you
from others.

480
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,636
That you've changed a lot...

481
00:39:08,037 --> 00:39:11,708
No! You changed everything
about me!

482
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,770
I was supposed to die!

483
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:19,857
You were supposed to kill me
along with our parents.

484
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:24,363
But...

485
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:25,863
Why me?!

486
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,407
How was I different from
mother and father?

487
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,368
Why just me?

488
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,537
Because you didn't know anything.

489
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,582
You had no part in
the Uchiha Clan's folly.

490
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:38,751
You were just a child.

491
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:42,254
Also, do you think
I did it just for you?

492
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:47,593
I wanted to be judged and
dealt with only by another Uchiha.

493
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:52,932
So I took advantage of
the hatred inside you.

494
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:55,559
That's why I failed.

495
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:02,400
Ultimately, I filled you with hatred
and made you go rogue.

496
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,652
And turned you into a criminal!

497
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:10,491
All I wanted was for you
to walk the right path.

498
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:21,085
Before I died, I tried to lead you

499
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:24,505
down that one path
without any forks or turns...

500
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,262
I changed the signposts

501
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:33,305
on that path with lies
and my visual prowess.

502
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:36,392
I was supposed to happily walk
that one path,

503
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,185
ignorant of everything?!

504
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:47,111
I... don't care for such a path!

505
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,156
Yeah...

506
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:51,699
You're absolutely right.

507
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:54,952
You must decide your own journey.

508
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,914
No matter how much you try
to rewrite the signposts,

509
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,292
my eyes can strip away
the top layer!

510
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,754
What's so funny?!

511
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:07,840
Nothing...

512
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,675
I'm just realizing that

513
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:12,094
the signposts were
not your only guides.

514
00:41:16,221 --> 00:41:18,140
I'm a dead man.

515
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,274
There's no point in
talking any further.

516
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,528
When you were alive,
you never paid any attention to me.

517
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:33,157
Always flicking my forehead,
saying "forgive me" and running off.

518
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:37,161
Now you're dead, and
you're still running away from me?!

519
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:39,205
I'm not running away.

520
00:41:40,021 --> 00:41:41,022
I told you.

521
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:43,375
There's something I must do.

522
00:41:44,995 --> 00:41:46,102
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

523
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,131
Damn it!

524
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,175
You stay here.

525
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,309
<i>There, huh?</i>

526
00:42:00,394 --> 00:42:01,906
<i>What a useless barrier.</i>

527
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,491
I'm impressed you were able
to pass through my barrier,

528
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,159
and find this place.

529
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,787
When you were controlling me,

530
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:23,249
I was able to pinpoint where
your chakra was coming from.

531
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,834
That's another risk of this jutsu.

532
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:28,921
Though you won't need to
remember that for next time.

533
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,090
Thanks for the tip.

534
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:35,469
I didn't expect any shinobi
to counter this jutsu,

535
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:38,138
so I didn't even worry about it.

536
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:42,518
By the way, there's something
I'd like you to know as well.

537
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:47,314
This Reanimation Jutsu
will not come undone

538
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:49,275
even if you kill me.

539
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:52,695
But I am the only one
who can stop it.

540
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:54,530
In other words...

541
00:42:54,762 --> 00:42:56,889
You can't kill me.

542
00:42:57,491 --> 00:43:01,495
If I die, you'll never be able
to stop this jutsu.

543
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:11,380
I guess my luck
hasn't run out yet!

544
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:15,134
Things are not always as
we wish them to be, damn it!

545
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:16,468
I caught up to you!

546
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:18,345
What the hell are you doing here?

547
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,183
Is that... Orochimaru?

548
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:25,978
You're a little off...

549
00:43:26,809 --> 00:43:28,352
That voice...

550
00:43:28,521 --> 00:43:29,522
Kabuto!

551
00:43:30,443 --> 00:43:33,419
It's perfect timing that my compensation
for participating in this war

552
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,447
would show up, on his own,
at this particular moment...

553
00:43:36,811 --> 00:43:38,511
I am so lucky.

554
00:43:40,008 --> 00:43:41,510
What are you talking about?

555
00:43:41,676 --> 00:43:43,762
It's rather complicated...

556
00:43:44,184 --> 00:43:46,660
Let me try to explain.

557
00:43:46,685 --> 00:43:48,353
Go ahead.

558
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,045
And in the meantime,
I'll stop the Reanimation.

559
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:53,231
Sasuke...

560
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:57,301
You want to bring down Itachi, the
bane of the Uchiha, once again, don't you?

561
00:43:57,623 --> 00:44:00,376
Since I brought him back
to this realm.

562
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:05,893
In short, Itachi is a nuisance
to both you and me.

563
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:12,775
Well? Shall we team up and
take Itachi down together?

564
00:44:13,863 --> 00:44:16,629
We share the same power of
the snake and the same Master—

565
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,697
I have no intention of calling
that thing my Master!

566
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:22,534
Besides, it seems like
you don't know anything, do you?

567
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:27,081
I chased Itachi all the way here
to talk to him.

568
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:31,460
Well then... whose side
are you on right now?

569
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:35,255
Why?!

570
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:37,299
He's just like Orochimaru!

571
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,009
Which means he's my enemy!

572
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:41,929
And right now,
he's your enemy too, right?!

573
00:44:43,011 --> 00:44:45,472
All right, we'll talk later.

574
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,310
First things first,
let's take him down.

575
00:44:48,779 --> 00:44:50,072
But don't kill him.

576
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:54,024
If you kill the caster
of the Reanimation,

577
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:55,943
the jutsu can never be undone.

578
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:59,363
We'll put him under
my Tsukuyomi,

579
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:01,907
then we'll make him tell us
how to stop this jutsu.

580
00:45:02,643 --> 00:45:06,105
And while he's still under
the Tsukuyomi,

581
00:45:06,546 --> 00:45:09,007
I'll control him and...
I'll break this jutsu.

582
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,800
Thanks for the play-by-play.

583
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:22,261
I hope it goes as smoothly
as you say.

584
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:23,529
But I told you earlier,

585
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,222
this jutsu has neither weakness
nor risks—

586
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:27,933
Every jutsu has a weakness.

587
00:45:29,427 --> 00:45:31,513
This jutsu's weakness and risk...

588
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:33,981
is my existence!

589
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:40,497
Itachi... you've kept lying to me,

590
00:45:40,522 --> 00:45:44,442
telling me "next time"
or "later," then you died on me...

591
00:45:47,889 --> 00:45:49,974
So this time for sure...

592
00:45:49,999 --> 00:45:51,793
I'm holding you to your promise.

593
00:45:52,441 --> 00:45:55,210
They say you take
your personality to the grave.

594
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:57,171
Well, I've already died once.

595
00:45:58,494 --> 00:45:59,871
I intend to honor it.

596
00:46:00,556 --> 00:46:03,392
The estranged brothers
come together to gang up on me?

597
00:46:05,065 --> 00:46:06,316
How fun!

598
00:46:08,362 --> 00:46:12,617
Bookish types like me
aren't used to being stared at.

599
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:16,607
Countermeasures for genjutsu, huh?

600
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:21,278
Judging from their movements,

601
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,614
those snakes can sense
exactly what we're doing.

602
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:26,950
Snakes perceive their surroundings
through body heat

603
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,744
and smell through their tongues.

604
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:30,829
You've done your research!

605
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:32,950
You're like a snake expert now.

606
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:36,584
Naturally. In order
to take down Orochimaru!

607
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:38,280
However...

608
00:46:38,305 --> 00:46:41,558
You can't beat me by just
being a snake expert.

609
00:46:42,305 --> 00:46:46,017
This is my field.
Nature is on my side.

610
00:46:48,591 --> 00:46:50,050
<i>The snakes have gotten bigger!</i>

611
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,666
Does this terrain give him
an advantage?

612
00:46:51,691 --> 00:46:53,776
Be wary of traps, Sasuke.

613
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:55,979
Traps?

614
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:57,856
Oh, that's not what I meant!

615
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,004
That's the Susano'o, right?

616
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:26,885
Don't get too violent, Sasuke!

617
00:47:27,195 --> 00:47:28,874
Remember, I told you
not to kill him!

618
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:32,307
It seems he's acquired
Orochimaru's power.

619
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,685
He won't die so easily!

620
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:38,814
Sasuke!

621
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,232
The hood!

622
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,026
What?!

623
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:48,949
Why that—!

624
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:59,376
You're taking
the shyness thing too far.

625
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:02,963
First, you hide your face,
and now your entire body?

626
00:48:04,525 --> 00:48:06,527
Did you just molt
to make a getaway?

627
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,553
All you have is what
you took from Orochimaru.

628
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,013
You're still nothing!

629
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:15,851
Sasuke... You underestimate me.

630
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:18,729
Well, then again,
I was listed lower than you

631
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:20,731
on the danger scale
in the Bingo Book...

632
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:24,109
And of course, I'm nothing
compared to Lord Orochimaru.

633
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,070
That's for sure.

634
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:29,823
Especially if you consider
this hiding.

635
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,700
Sasuke, watch out!

636
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:34,202
There's chakra everywhere...

637
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:38,498
It's hard to tell which
is the real one.

638
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:46,410
It's the ability to transform
one's flesh into liquid.

639
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:49,635
To detach and separate
using one's own life substance.

640
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:51,803
That's why it looks like a shedding.

641
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:54,740
I've researched and applied

642
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:58,477
the Hozuki Clan's Flesh Transforming
ability to this technique.

643
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:01,980
You know him, don't you? Suigetsu.

644
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:06,401
He can transform from human
to water, and back to human again.

645
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:11,506
Plus, I have the amazing ability
to recuperate quickly.

646
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:15,494
I admit it's a healing technique
that I studied

647
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:18,747
from the body of a woman
originally from the Uzumaki Clan...

648
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,751
Someone you're quite familiar
with... Karin.

649
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:26,338
Karin's from the Uzumaki Clan?

650
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:31,218
A special trait of those with
Uzumaki blood is their red hair.

651
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:34,388
And their life force is
as tenacious as a cockroach.

652
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:37,182
Now then, you must be thinking

653
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:40,268
about the last member
of your team.

654
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,772
Or perhaps he's no longer
your comrade?

655
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:50,612
You have a discerning eye
since you chose those three.

656
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:58,328
In the shinobi World,
those without talent are nothing.

657
00:49:58,399 --> 00:50:03,696
But those who lack talent
can just steal it from those who do.

658
00:50:05,144 --> 00:50:08,313
Seems like you have
Jugo's ability too...

659
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:11,719
Did you receive a Curse Mark
from Orochimaru?!

660
00:50:11,744 --> 00:50:12,954
No!

661
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:17,514
That is just a temporary boost.

662
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:21,560
That memento is something
I actually cultivated myself...

663
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:24,563
at Ryuchi Cave!

664
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:25,814
Ryuchi Cave?!

665
00:50:26,181 --> 00:50:28,350
Yes, I found it!

666
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:34,156
A place as legendary as Mt. Myoboku,
and the Shikkotsu Woods!

667
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,409
Lord Orochimaru is not
the only one to have reached it.

668
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:39,036
I went there...

669
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:44,708
and trained under the guidance
of the White Snake Sage.

670
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:49,046
And I was able to surpass
Lord Orochimaru at long last.

671
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,383
I did it!

672
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,783
Don't be impatient, Sasuke!

673
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,585
He dodged... that arrow?

674
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:32,589
My sensory ability is better
than it used to be.

675
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:35,912
Nature Energy is my ally now.

676
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:38,512
Nature Energy?

677
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,139
<i>I knew it. So he does have...</i>

678
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,100
Listen...

679
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:46,645
The members of Jugo's clan
have always had

680
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:49,773
special bodies that
absorbed Nature Energy.

681
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:52,482
That's the secret behind
those rampages.

682
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:55,695
The ability causes them to suddenly
become more wild and powerful.

683
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:59,741
Lord Orochimaru wasn't interested
in Jugo's rampages...

684
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:03,453
so much as the origin
of his clan's power.

685
00:52:10,234 --> 00:52:13,737
And he finally found the source...

686
00:52:14,412 --> 00:52:16,372
It was Ryuchi Cave.

687
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:22,722
Lord Orochimaru immediately
tried to acquire that power.

688
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:27,894
But, he didn't yet possess a body
that could tolerate it.

689
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:29,896
That's why...

690
00:52:37,012 --> 00:52:41,141
He couldn't become the perfect Sage...

691
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:44,369
that I have become!

692
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:49,124
Just as I thought...
you're using Sage Mode.

693
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,294
You're just like Orochimaru!

694
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,129
A disgusting snake!

695
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:58,550
You ought to know better,
you snake expert...

696
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:01,511
I'm no longer a snake.

697
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:05,765
With my perfect Sage power,
I've shed my snakeskin...

698
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:09,144
I am now a dragon!

699
00:53:15,328 --> 00:53:17,830
<i>Sage Art: White Extreme Attack!</i>

700
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:35,462
<i>My ears...</i>

701
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:38,131
<i>And my bones... They feel like
they're being grated.</i>

702
00:53:38,156 --> 00:53:39,741
<i>It's a jutsu that uses
light and sound</i>

703
00:53:39,766 --> 00:53:41,684
<i>to impair vision and hearing...</i>

704
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:46,202
<i>A jutsu that causes the air to oscillate...
to paralyze the senses, freezing movement.</i>

705
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:54,314
<i>A snake's cornea can
block out the light</i>

706
00:53:54,628 --> 00:53:56,374
<i>and by turning my flesh
into fluid,</i>

707
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:58,902
<i>I can easily absorb
the sound and vibration.</i>

708
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:02,030
<i>The only one who can move
freely under these conditions...</i>

709
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,365
<i>is me in Sage Mode!</i>

710
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:05,975
<i>It's no use!</i>

711
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,668
<i>We can't maintain Susano'o!</i>

712
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:10,247
<i>Yes, I should go for Itachi.</i>

713
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:12,624
<i>I'll rewrite the Paper Seal
in his head</i>

714
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:14,084
<i>and turn him into my pawn again.</i>

715
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:17,212
<i>Or even better...</i>

716
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,137
Itachi...

717
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:29,683
It seems you always
end up finding me.

718
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,144
Can you sense my chakra?

719
00:54:33,782 --> 00:54:36,117
I never said I was the one

720
00:54:36,142 --> 00:54:38,019
who was able to sense
your chakra.

721
00:54:39,521 --> 00:54:42,816
Only Nagato could do that,
and I was with him.

722
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:44,973
I have no such ability.

723
00:54:48,935 --> 00:54:53,356
Besides, even now, I know
what your target is anyway.

724
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:56,876
I merely move to protect that which
I think you'll most want to attack.

725
00:54:58,051 --> 00:55:01,638
If a man as cautious and
opportunistic as you wants Sasuke...

726
00:55:01,663 --> 00:55:03,582
you will go for him first.

727
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:07,637
Your best chance to
capture Sasuke is now,

728
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:09,764
before either of us figures
out your jutsu.

729
00:55:09,789 --> 00:55:13,626
And after that, you could use
Sasuke to manipulate me.

730
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:20,291
What sets you apart from
the rest of the Uchiha Clan

731
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:22,526
is that you have true visual prowess...

732
00:55:23,262 --> 00:55:26,307
You have the ability to peer into
and read people's souls.

733
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:29,326
And use what you learn in battle.

734
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:33,705
That is why you are so good
at deceiving people...

735
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:36,024
You died lying in the first place,

736
00:55:36,049 --> 00:55:38,718
that makes you a lying ninja
through and through!

737
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:45,800
<i>He's on the ceiling!</i>

738
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:51,598
You think a makeshift team of two

739
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:55,477
can outwit my perception skills?

740
00:55:56,490 --> 00:55:58,742
And because your brother
lied so much,

741
00:55:58,993 --> 00:56:01,955
you know nothing about each other...

742
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:07,197
Sasuke...

743
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:10,158
Do you remember that time

744
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,160
you tagged along with me
on my mission?

745
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:14,871
The wild boar?

746
00:56:19,683 --> 00:56:20,684
That's it, right?

747
00:56:21,351 --> 00:56:22,352
Don't kill it.

748
00:56:22,644 --> 00:56:23,183
Huh?

749
00:56:23,208 --> 00:56:25,126
Just hurt it, and it will return
to the mountain.

750
00:56:26,251 --> 00:56:27,252
Let's go.

751
00:56:27,277 --> 00:56:28,278
Yeah.

752
00:56:30,341 --> 00:56:31,550
Don't hit a vital spot.

753
00:56:35,714 --> 00:56:37,048
I know!

754
00:56:58,929 --> 00:56:59,930
– Now!
– Now!

755
00:57:14,006 --> 00:57:15,716
He's going to steal my blade

756
00:57:15,741 --> 00:57:17,367
and cut off his own tail
to escape!

757
00:57:29,938 --> 00:57:32,900
<i>That's why he told you
not to be so impatient.</i>

758
00:58:01,652 --> 00:58:04,446
Oh that's right, I'd forgotten.

759
00:58:04,717 --> 00:58:08,470
I have horns here now.

760
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:55,990
Big brother...

761
00:59:00,813 --> 00:59:02,398
You completely missed.

762
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:04,707
Sorry, big brother...

763
00:59:05,173 --> 00:59:06,891
You need more training.

764
00:59:10,075 --> 00:59:11,326
Let's go home, Sasuke.

765
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:15,755
I'll help you train
when we return.

766
00:59:17,959 --> 00:59:18,918
Okay!

767
00:59:22,971 --> 00:59:26,292
Looks like you might be able to
take down that giant wild boar now.

768
00:59:30,999 --> 00:59:35,111
Instead of that giant wild boar,
we've got to take down that snake.

769
00:59:35,136 --> 00:59:36,203
Yeah...

770
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,494
It's so funny...

771
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:44,330
What is?

772
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:47,125
Right now, you two look like

773
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:49,377
you're quite friendly
with each other.

774
00:59:50,044 --> 00:59:53,798
What happened to those brothers
who fought and hated each other?

775
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:58,511
It's not hard to guess that something
happened between you two,

776
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:00,680
back when you took him down...

777
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:04,684
But what is it that you want to ask
of a once-dead man?

778
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:09,522
The truth.

779
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:13,860
Oh really?

780
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:17,947
Could it be?
With the way you're talking...

781
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:22,160
you don't really trust
Itachi, after all?

782
01:00:23,971 --> 01:00:24,972
Sasuke...

783
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:29,626
Maybe you already know
the truth about Itachi?

784
01:00:33,774 --> 01:00:36,735
No wonder you didn't return
to the Leaf

785
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,845
after defeating Itachi.

786
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:42,680
That's why you joined the Akatsuki
who plotted the Leaf's destruction!

787
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,100
I see now...

788
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:50,063
It all makes so much sense
to me now.

789
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:53,983
That's why you intend to
destroy the village

790
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:56,235
that caused your brother
so much pain.

791
01:01:00,075 --> 01:01:02,453
As expected.
You're not denying it.

792
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:05,703
So you followed your brother,
who you happened across,

793
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:08,122
all the way here to find out
the truth once and for all.

794
01:01:08,891 --> 01:01:13,395
Like "Is this what happened then?"
and "What about that time?"

795
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:14,879
in complete detail...

796
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:21,111
Like I said,
your brother is a liar!

797
01:01:21,914 --> 01:01:22,915
I know.

798
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:25,973
So isn't it odd?

799
01:01:27,922 --> 01:01:31,952
Itachi was willing to kill his
own family to protect the village.

800
01:01:32,677 --> 01:01:35,597
Isn't that the opposite of
what you're trying to do?

801
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:37,944
Well...

802
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:42,532
I'm the one who wants
what you want, Sasuke!

803
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:46,828
After all, Lord Orochimaru could not
complete Leaf Destruction.

804
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:49,497
And it is I who inherited that task.

805
01:01:51,807 --> 01:01:53,892
So think carefully...

806
01:01:55,002 --> 01:01:59,507
Now's the time to stab Itachi
in the back and join me.

807
01:02:00,021 --> 01:02:02,899
What? You don't have to feel guilty.

808
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:08,725
He's already dead.
He's just an imitation.

809
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:17,984
We received intel that
Itachi Uchiha of the Akatsuki is dead.

810
01:02:18,778 --> 01:02:22,903
Put a mark on his image and
remove him from your Bingo Book.

811
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:25,950
So that traitor is dead at last.

812
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:32,665
But Captain,
who was able to kill him?

813
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:35,835
Looks like it was
his kid brother, Sasuke.

814
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:40,423
How ironic... His own brother killed
the one who slaughtered his family.

815
01:02:40,792 --> 01:02:44,045
Serves him right!
After the atrocities he committed!

816
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:48,139
Not only that, he joined up with the
Akatsuki and came after the Leaf Village!

817
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:52,226
He's the most notorious villain
in Hidden Leaf history!

818
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:55,772
Damn it, I wish we got
our hands on him first!

819
01:02:57,356 --> 01:03:00,777
Since he took down such
a special S-Class criminal,

820
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:03,212
his little brother will probably
receive many decorations

821
01:03:03,237 --> 01:03:05,364
and a large bounty from
the nation and village, right?

822
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:07,283
I wonder how much?

823
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:10,203
It's not a question of money.
You're out of line.

824
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:12,079
Well... I know, but...

825
01:03:13,932 --> 01:03:15,851
They don't know the truth...

826
01:03:16,357 --> 01:03:18,359
Besides, there are
too many people around.

827
01:03:19,110 --> 01:03:20,904
I'll teach them the truth!

828
01:03:20,996 --> 01:03:22,039
Don't...

829
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:26,511
Even if they try to confirm the truth
about Itachi with their superiors,

830
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:29,372
the Leaf's elders will
deny it vehemently.

831
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:33,146
Even the current Hokage
doesn't know the facts.

832
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,164
Furthermore...

833
01:03:35,555 --> 01:03:39,976
Itachi did slaughter the Uchiha,
and he joined the Akatsuki

834
01:03:40,001 --> 01:03:41,961
on the pretense of attacking
the Hidden Leaf.

835
01:03:42,443 --> 01:03:44,403
No one will believe the truth...

836
01:03:45,446 --> 01:03:47,949
Look how long it took you.

837
01:03:50,012 --> 01:03:51,931
For bastards like them...

838
01:03:52,993 --> 01:03:56,329
For these bastards
who easily brand him a traitor...

839
01:03:56,457 --> 01:03:57,917
my brother...

840
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:00,584
This is exactly what
Itachi wanted.

841
01:04:00,609 --> 01:04:04,029
If you don't like it,
what is it that you want?

842
01:04:06,474 --> 01:04:07,933
We're not the same.

843
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:12,306
My Leaf Destruction is mine alone!

844
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:16,936
I understand very well
why Itachi chose that life.

845
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,772
I was just like him...

846
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,362
It was nice being found
by a Leaf shinobi,

847
01:04:23,387 --> 01:04:25,628
but because my background
was a mystery,

848
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:27,530
I was raised to be a spy.

849
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:29,945
In order to become someone
who could be trusted,

850
01:04:29,970 --> 01:04:31,805
medical ninjutsu was
drilled into me.

851
01:04:33,328 --> 01:04:36,665
I went from village to
village spying...

852
01:04:37,595 --> 01:04:41,766
I pretended to be someone else,
living a life of lies.

853
01:04:42,259 --> 01:04:44,595
With no place for the real me.

854
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:47,592
I had no friends
who knew the real me.

855
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:49,760
I continued to work
on suppressing myself.

856
01:04:50,383 --> 01:04:53,678
And around the time I stopped knowing
who I even was anymore...

857
01:04:53,703 --> 01:04:56,498
the Hidden Leaf Village
stopped trusting me

858
01:04:56,523 --> 01:04:58,317
and I was relieved of my mission.

859
01:05:00,354 --> 01:05:03,983
Both Itachi and I worked for
the good of the Leaf Village,

860
01:05:04,483 --> 01:05:07,612
but in return, all we got
was dishonor and disgrace!

861
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:12,283
What in the world has
the Leaf Village ever done for us?

862
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:18,164
How Itachi lived is what led to
the creation of the current you.

863
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:20,999
And though I am still alive,

864
01:05:21,024 --> 01:05:23,444
something similar to you
was born from me too.

865
01:05:24,363 --> 01:05:28,033
No one understands you
better than I.

866
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:32,720
Thus, I will be your big brother
and stick by your side.

867
01:05:33,261 --> 01:05:35,096
Now... join me...

868
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:37,767
Don't listen to him, Sasuke.

869
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:40,853
He was an even better spy
than I was.

870
01:05:41,059 --> 01:05:43,979
Which means, he's even better
than me at lying.

871
01:05:44,564 --> 01:05:45,606
And...

872
01:05:46,074 --> 01:05:49,578
No matter what darkness or
contradictions lie within the village,

873
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:52,323
I am still Itachi Uchiha of the Leaf!

874
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:59,622
Sasuke... It's my fault
you're like this right now.

875
01:06:00,247 --> 01:06:04,126
I know I have no right
to advise you in any way.

876
01:06:04,717 --> 01:06:07,636
But I hope you'll hear me out

877
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:10,257
because I have to
tell you something.

878
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,971
But first, let's take care
of business...

879
01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:17,474
and stop this guy.

880
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:22,228
You cannot kill me

881
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:24,689
as long as I am the user
of the Reanimation Jutsu.

882
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:28,943
And I can instantly recover
from any injury you inflict.

883
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,569
It's meaningless.

884
01:06:31,414 --> 01:06:33,624
I shut down my eyesight.

885
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:37,618
So the much-touted genjutsu of
your visual prowess won't work on me...

886
01:06:38,465 --> 01:06:40,842
You, brothers, can't beat me!

887
01:06:41,534 --> 01:06:43,373
Because I cast it,

888
01:06:43,398 --> 01:06:46,067
this Reanimation Jutsu
is invincible!

889
01:06:47,587 --> 01:06:50,298
It's a pain listening to him.

890
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:53,092
But he explained
the situation perfectly.

891
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:55,136
I don't need you to tell me that.

892
01:06:55,302 --> 01:06:56,721
So... what should we do?

893
01:06:57,346 --> 01:07:00,266
He doesn't know the true power
of the Uchiha.

894
01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:06,678
The Uchiha have a visual jutsu that can
be used on an opponent without eyesight...

895
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:09,984
In exchange for losing the light
in one's eyes.

896
01:07:10,609 --> 01:07:11,819
Izanagi...?

897
01:07:12,486 --> 01:07:13,863
You know about Izanagi?

898
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:17,700
Danzo used it when I fought him.

899
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:20,286
You're lucky to be alive.

900
01:07:21,495 --> 01:07:22,788
Never mind about that...

901
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:24,498
How do we use Izanagi?

902
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:26,500
I'm not talking about Izanagi.

903
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:29,336
Another Forbidden Jutsu that
is considered its other half.

904
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,047
Another?!

905
01:07:31,672 --> 01:07:33,299
I've already laid the plan.

906
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:37,511
An Ultimate visual jutsu that
holds his fate within its grasp.

907
01:07:39,870 --> 01:07:40,996
<i>Izanami!</i>

908
01:07:41,316 --> 01:07:42,396
<i>Izanami?!</i>

909
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:48,939
If Izanagi is a jutsu
that changes one's fate,

910
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:51,984
then Izanami is a jutsu
that decides it!

911
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:55,821
Sasuke... Do not leave my side.

912
01:07:55,988 --> 01:07:57,948
<i>A jutsu that decides one's fate?</i>

913
01:07:57,990 --> 01:08:00,534
<i>So there's another jutsu
similar to Izanagi?!</i>

914
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:05,623
I don't know what you're up to...

915
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:08,918
but nothing will work against me.

916
01:08:09,376 --> 01:08:14,006
It seems you still don't
understand just who I am!

917
01:08:14,983 --> 01:08:17,360
<i>Sage Art: Inorganic Animation!</i>

918
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:22,932
Itachi!

919
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:26,166
This jutsu brings
the lifeless to life

920
01:08:26,191 --> 01:08:29,278
and allows me to control them.

921
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:32,900
It's different from a jutsu that
simply manipulates with chakra...

922
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:34,819
A bit extreme, don't you think?

923
01:08:37,164 --> 01:08:40,501
Protecting Sasuke with
your Susano'o slowed you down.

924
01:08:40,946 --> 01:08:44,450
Well, don't worry.
I would never harm Sasuke.

925
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:47,164
He's my precious test subject.

926
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:49,158
Now then...

927
01:08:49,183 --> 01:08:51,978
Time to rewrite your mind with this.

928
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:54,255
You know what will happen, right?

929
01:08:57,336 --> 01:08:58,337
<i>Amaterasu!</i>

930
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:14,906
So the ultimate offensive 
visual jutsu

931
01:09:14,931 --> 01:09:17,392
is also the ultimate defense...

932
01:09:18,445 --> 01:09:22,158
It's so hot, the limestone cave
went back to being just a cave.

933
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:28,080
I'm sorry... Sasuke...

934
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:31,292
Sorry, but this is my win.

935
01:09:31,578 --> 01:09:36,046
I am so near the point where I
can achieve and control everything...

936
01:09:36,088 --> 01:09:39,341
I can't imagine myself failing.

937
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:43,388
All the laws and principles
of nature,

938
01:09:43,413 --> 01:09:47,292
which Lord Orochimaru researched
and compiled for so long...

939
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:51,020
are now stored and
being used inside of me.

940
01:09:51,163 --> 01:09:54,125
I have evolved from human
to snake to dragon.

941
01:09:55,056 --> 01:09:59,626
I am the closest thing in this
world to the Sage of Six Paths.

942
01:10:00,569 --> 01:10:03,114
Compared to me, the Uchiha are...

943
01:10:03,139 --> 01:10:04,224
Shut up!

944
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:06,146
What would you know...
about the Uchiha?!

945
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:07,494
Listen...!

946
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:10,748
Kabuto...

947
01:10:11,092 --> 01:10:12,551
When I look at you,

948
01:10:12,631 --> 01:10:15,050
it's like looking at my former self.

949
01:10:15,669 --> 01:10:18,339
And that is why you will lose...

950
01:10:22,968 --> 01:10:26,597
Listen... I'm not on
the sidelines anymore.

951
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:29,975
You could say I'm a central figure
in this war!

952
01:10:30,326 --> 01:10:32,143
I had the Akatsuki twisted
around my little finger,

953
01:10:32,168 --> 01:10:34,003
and manipulated this war
to my advantage...

954
01:10:34,145 --> 01:10:36,355
and I even pushed
the Uchiha brothers into a corner.

955
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:42,446
I hate you,
but I understand you.

956
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:47,901
We were both spies who
lived false lives in this world.

957
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:51,872
I didn't know who I really was
at one point either.

958
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:55,793
I finally understand that
to know oneself

959
01:10:55,834 --> 01:10:59,213
is not to achieve everything
and become perfect.

960
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:04,185
It's knowing what you can
and cannot do.

961
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:07,179
Sounds like the words of a loser.

962
01:11:07,554 --> 01:11:10,055
Acknowledging what
you cannot do...

963
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,581
Isn't that the same as giving up?

964
01:11:11,810 --> 01:11:12,853
No.

965
01:11:12,878 --> 01:11:16,740
It is to be able to forgive oneself for
the things one cannot do by themselves.

966
01:11:18,156 --> 01:11:20,283
You can't do everything yourself.

967
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:23,153
That's why you have comrades
who can help you.

968
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:27,616
And it also makes sure that you don't miss
the things that you can still accomplish.

969
01:11:29,137 --> 01:11:31,681
If you want to know
who you are...

970
01:11:31,943 --> 01:11:35,613
You must reexamine and
acknowledge your true self.

971
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:38,314
I failed to do that.

972
01:11:39,164 --> 01:11:43,710
I lied to everyone and I lied to myself...
and I deluded myself.

973
01:11:45,254 --> 01:11:49,216
Those who cannot acknowledge
themselves will fail...

974
01:11:50,294 --> 01:11:52,129
Just like I did.

975
01:11:52,827 --> 01:11:56,122
And what would you two
really know about me?

976
01:11:56,812 --> 01:12:01,358
I have been pursuing who
and what I am in my own way.

977
01:12:02,018 --> 01:12:03,144
My whole life...

978
01:12:06,136 --> 01:12:07,929
I bet he's from that city...

979
01:12:08,102 --> 01:12:10,313
Where that recent battle was!

980
01:12:10,498 --> 01:12:11,750
What'll we do, Sis?

981
01:12:12,226 --> 01:12:14,478
He's bleeding from the head.

982
01:12:14,883 --> 01:12:16,343
He's going to die soon.

983
01:12:16,533 --> 01:12:17,534
Are you going to take him?

984
01:12:18,357 --> 01:12:19,483
Urushi...

985
01:12:19,639 --> 01:12:21,808
His injuries are less severe
than yours were.

986
01:12:23,028 --> 01:12:24,196
Don't worry.

987
01:12:24,715 --> 01:12:27,760
I may not look it,
but I know some medical ninjutsu.

988
01:12:29,227 --> 01:12:30,395
Where are your parents?

989
01:12:32,852 --> 01:12:34,312
What's your name?

990
01:12:38,312 --> 01:12:40,939
Man... Don't you understand anything?!

991
01:12:41,135 --> 01:12:42,679
Urushi, lend him your shoulder.

992
01:12:45,585 --> 01:12:47,212
You're lucky, kid!

993
01:12:47,431 --> 01:12:49,349
Come on, grab my shoulder!

994
01:12:52,075 --> 01:12:53,869
<i>That's my first memory...</i>

995
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,466
<i>I was a nobody</i>

996
01:12:58,457 --> 01:13:00,626
<i>and had nothing from
the very beginning.</i>

997
01:13:01,126 --> 01:13:03,337
Your wound seems
to be healing nicely.

998
01:13:04,254 --> 01:13:06,590
Hey, at least say, "thank you"!

999
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:08,384
Don't you have any manners?!

1000
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:12,304
Hey, we don't want anything to
happen to you again, so put this on!

1001
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:13,347
Ow...

1002
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:16,046
You don't have manners,
you don't have parents...

1003
01:13:16,071 --> 01:13:18,990
you don't even know your name.
That's a first for me!

1004
01:13:21,688 --> 01:13:24,149
You'll be living here
with us now.

1005
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:28,612
In other words, I am your mother,
starting now.

1006
01:13:29,154 --> 01:13:31,448
You can always ask me
for whatever you need.

1007
01:13:32,154 --> 01:13:35,657
It's inconvenient that
he doesn't have a name...

1008
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,496
You're right...

1009
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:42,167
What would be a good name?

1010
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:49,719
How about...
"Kabuto" like the helmet?

1011
01:13:50,002 --> 01:13:51,920
– Sounds simple.
– That was quick.

1012
01:13:52,143 --> 01:13:53,561
Just based on looks.

1013
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:55,982
It's best not to overthink things.

1014
01:13:56,007 --> 01:13:59,435
– I'll think of something.
– Not you!

1015
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:00,503
What would be a good name?

1016
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:04,815
Hey, he smiled!

1017
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:07,443
I think he likes that name!

1018
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:09,403
Oh good...

1019
01:14:19,485 --> 01:14:23,437
<i>At least say, "thank you"!
Don't you have any manners?!</i>

1020
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:30,703
Hmm... What to do...?

1021
01:14:32,092 --> 01:14:36,144
We can't get by with just subsistence
aid from the village or nation anymore.

1022
01:14:37,894 --> 01:14:41,898
We have to talk to them once more!

1023
01:14:42,177 --> 01:14:45,096
Neither the village nor
the nation will give us a cent more.

1024
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:48,775
But we're barely scraping by.

1025
01:14:48,775 --> 01:14:51,778
And we just took another one in...

1026
01:14:52,519 --> 01:14:56,564
I understand.
I'll do something about it, so...

1027
01:14:57,051 --> 01:14:58,052
Oww!

1028
01:15:00,954 --> 01:15:03,081
What are you doing at this hour?!

1029
01:15:03,123 --> 01:15:04,833
You should be in bed!

1030
01:15:08,601 --> 01:15:10,478
He just got here and

1031
01:15:10,586 --> 01:15:12,839
doesn't know about
our curfews and rules!

1032
01:15:13,329 --> 01:15:14,831
Please give him another chance!

1033
01:15:16,374 --> 01:15:19,174
You're too indulgent, Mother.

1034
01:15:20,385 --> 01:15:22,763
Come here and look at the clock!

1035
01:15:23,144 --> 01:15:25,814
It's already 20 minutes
past lights-out time!

1036
01:15:26,233 --> 01:15:28,361
Which makes lights-out
what time?

1037
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:31,151
Let's learn it right now!

1038
01:15:34,470 --> 01:15:37,723
Well, what time is it?
You must learn it yourself!

1039
01:15:43,742 --> 01:15:45,535
He's still young.

1040
01:15:46,189 --> 01:15:49,734
He doesn't know arithmetic
or how to tell time.

1041
01:15:50,128 --> 01:15:51,783
Let's just call it a night.

1042
01:15:51,808 --> 01:15:52,809
Nine o'clock.

1043
01:15:54,814 --> 01:15:56,148
That's correct.

1044
01:15:58,707 --> 01:16:01,174
It seems it was just bad vision!

1045
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:02,700
He's smart for his age!

1046
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:04,560
We must get him glasses!

1047
01:16:04,736 --> 01:16:07,778
Huh? And where are we going
to get money for that?

1048
01:16:08,043 --> 01:16:12,255
Seriously! If you couldn't see,
you should have spoken up.

1049
01:16:20,868 --> 01:16:23,412
From now on,
you'll be able to be on time.

1050
01:16:24,199 --> 01:16:27,160
I just hope the lenses
are right for you.

1051
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:45,142
Thank... you...

1052
01:16:46,945 --> 01:16:48,947
<i>My name is symbolic.</i>

1053
01:16:49,313 --> 01:16:51,189
<i>My eyeglasses, a tool...</i>

1054
01:16:52,107 --> 01:16:53,056
Thank you...

1055
01:16:53,081 --> 01:16:54,207
<i>From the very beginning,</i>

1056
01:16:54,318 --> 01:16:56,570
– <i>I was a nobody...</i>
– Thank you...

1057
01:16:57,174 --> 01:16:58,675
Thank you...

1058
01:16:59,814 --> 01:17:00,899
Thank you...

1059
01:17:01,683 --> 01:17:02,768
That's enough.

1060
01:17:07,664 --> 01:17:09,166
Kabuto, are you able
to keep going?

1061
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:10,959
Yes, Mother!

1062
01:17:13,472 --> 01:17:15,195
I know it's for the sake
of the orphanage,

1063
01:17:15,220 --> 01:17:17,555
but why do we have
to help shinobi like them?

1064
01:17:19,419 --> 01:17:22,464
Doing nothing doesn't
bring in money...

1065
01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:24,890
Urushi, could you get more bandages?

1066
01:17:25,182 --> 01:17:26,183
Yeah, sure!

1067
01:17:30,771 --> 01:17:32,481
You're not a shinobi,

1068
01:17:32,579 --> 01:17:36,166
but you're quite skilled
at medical ninjutsu...

1069
01:17:37,152 --> 01:17:39,071
Mother taught me.

1070
01:17:39,863 --> 01:17:42,282
You said your name was Kabuto?

1071
01:17:43,116 --> 01:17:44,993
Why don't you become a shinobi?

1072
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:48,205
You'd make a good one...

1073
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:49,873
I'm sure of it.

1074
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:52,668
I'm not interested in that.

1075
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:56,546
I just want to help raise money
for the orphanage

1076
01:17:56,588 --> 01:17:59,549
and help Mother there.

1077
01:18:00,592 --> 01:18:02,427
She's done so much for me...

1078
01:18:02,469 --> 01:18:05,764
but I've only been able to repay her
with a pair of eyeglasses...

1079
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:10,352
Really? What a shame.

1080
01:18:14,064 --> 01:18:17,192
You were known
as the Wandering Nun,

1081
01:18:17,424 --> 01:18:19,551
and now you're just a babysitter.

1082
01:18:20,649 --> 01:18:23,276
It's been a while
since I last saw you,

1083
01:18:23,490 --> 01:18:26,284
but you're looking a little tired, Nonou.

1084
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:29,329
I cast aside that name long ago.

1085
01:18:30,267 --> 01:18:34,814
Talks with the Leaf for
monetary aid were concluded.

1086
01:18:35,637 --> 01:18:37,055
So why are you here now?

1087
01:18:37,548 --> 01:18:40,551
It seems the Espionage Unit's
former top spy

1088
01:18:40,576 --> 01:18:44,121
stopped knowing things after
she left the Foundation.

1089
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:47,514
We did not come here only
in regard to the aid money.

1090
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,392
In this time of war,

1091
01:18:50,434 --> 01:18:52,936
we have obtained intel that
the Hidden Stone are plotting

1092
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:54,584
some sort of large-scale operation.

1093
01:18:56,030 --> 01:18:58,956
We want you to infiltrate
the Hidden Stone

1094
01:18:58,981 --> 01:19:01,732
and verify the validity of this intel.

1095
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:05,073
And if it does turn out to be true,

1096
01:19:05,115 --> 01:19:07,451
you are to investigate what
this operation entails

1097
01:19:07,492 --> 01:19:11,997
and where it will occur
and report back to us.

1098
01:19:13,424 --> 01:19:15,426
This will likely be
a long-term mission.

1099
01:19:16,301 --> 01:19:17,969
Then you've come
to the wrong person.

1100
01:19:18,806 --> 01:19:20,099
I'm no longer...

1101
01:19:20,124 --> 01:19:23,513
You people don't understand
just how essential Mother is

1102
01:19:23,682 --> 01:19:26,685
to this orphanage and
to the children!

1103
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:30,515
She has done her utmost
to protect this orphanage.

1104
01:19:30,974 --> 01:19:32,350
Such a dangerous task!

1105
01:19:32,392 --> 01:19:34,519
You Foundation people ought
to do it yourselves.

1106
01:19:35,354 --> 01:19:37,272
Why must you come
and bother her?

1107
01:19:37,297 --> 01:19:40,214
The Wandering Nun is the only one

1108
01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:42,908
we can entrust
this long-term mission to.

1109
01:19:43,366 --> 01:19:48,579
Currently, no one in the Foundation
has her espionage skills.

1110
01:19:49,421 --> 01:19:52,835
Most would likely break or
end up switching allegiances.

1111
01:19:54,289 --> 01:19:58,210
I know that she's a Kunoichi who
would never sell out the Hidden Leaf...

1112
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:01,701
From that expression,

1113
01:20:01,726 --> 01:20:05,105
I can tell you've already
guessed it, Nonou.

1114
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:08,929
Yes, if you refuse,
this clinic will stop receiving funding.

1115
01:20:09,199 --> 01:20:10,158
That's not fair!

1116
01:20:10,416 --> 01:20:13,502
This was already settled
with the Third Hokage!

1117
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:15,936
You cannot do this!

1118
01:20:16,427 --> 01:20:19,497
This orphanage looks easy
to break into and rob...

1119
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:24,152
You should hire bodyguards to
prevent robbers from stealing your money.

1120
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:27,139
That is, if you can afford any.

1121
01:20:27,709 --> 01:20:32,263
While you're at it, take care that
your children don't get snatched either.

1122
01:20:32,744 --> 01:20:37,123
Children with no past or family
are worth something.

1123
01:20:37,165 --> 01:20:38,834
You're all rotten!

1124
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:40,335
How dare you call
yourselves shinobi?!

1125
01:20:40,737 --> 01:20:43,365
You're the ones
who don't understand!

1126
01:20:45,799 --> 01:20:49,052
It's a small price to pay
to protect the Hidden Leaf!

1127
01:20:51,710 --> 01:20:52,572
I understand.

1128
01:20:52,597 --> 01:20:53,974
Wait, Mother...!

1129
01:20:54,057 --> 01:20:57,894
It's come to this because
you couldn't kill your emotions.

1130
01:20:57,936 --> 01:21:00,856
You weren't suited for
the Foundation, after all.

1131
01:21:00,897 --> 01:21:03,149
How dare you...!

1132
01:21:04,901 --> 01:21:10,156
Also, I've already lost a subordinate
obtaining this intel...

1133
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:13,368
I'll be taking one of the children here
to replace him.

1134
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:14,703
How far will you go?

1135
01:21:14,744 --> 01:21:16,746
I said I'd accept the mission!

1136
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:19,249
This is a separate matter.

1137
01:21:19,452 --> 01:21:21,746
Your mission shall cover
subsequent payments.

1138
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:25,338
But this current one is
in exchange for the child.

1139
01:21:25,922 --> 01:21:32,387
Some children actually wish to
become a Leaf shinobi, after all.

1140
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:34,973
You should ask them
to choose for themselves.

1141
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:38,143
There may just be one such child.

1142
01:21:56,068 --> 01:21:57,653
Why, Kabuto?

1143
01:21:59,956 --> 01:22:01,708
I think I'm suited to be a ninja.

1144
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:04,169
Besides, I want to hone
my medical ninjutsu.

1145
01:22:04,628 --> 01:22:07,797
Kabuto! You're just going to throw away
the three years you spent with us?!

1146
01:22:08,048 --> 01:22:09,215
Come back here!

1147
01:22:11,217 --> 01:22:13,762
Have you forgotten
the house rules, everyone?

1148
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:16,681
It's way past lights-out.

1149
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:55,345
<i>It's no use. I'm surrounded.</i>

1150
01:22:59,963 --> 01:23:04,301
<i>If I hadn't messed up,
I'd be in bed by now.</i>

1151
01:23:06,289 --> 01:23:08,500
<i>It's been five years since
I left the orphanage.</i>

1152
01:23:09,332 --> 01:23:12,335
<i>I wish I could've seen Mother and
everyone else one last time...</i>

1153
01:23:29,337 --> 01:23:30,588
Mother!

1154
01:23:31,258 --> 01:23:33,636
No! Why are you here?

1155
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:42,391
<i>We want you to infiltrate
the Hidden Stone...</i>

1156
01:23:43,059 --> 01:23:45,877
<i>The Wandering Nun is the only one</i>

1157
01:23:45,902 --> 01:23:48,488
<i>we can entrust this
long-term mission to.</i>

1158
01:23:49,399 --> 01:23:53,194
<i>Don't tell me... you were still
on that last mission?!</i>

1159
01:23:54,821 --> 01:23:57,449
Why are you healing my wounds?

1160
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:00,452
Who are you...?

1161
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:02,829
It's me, Mother!

1162
01:24:06,624 --> 01:24:10,420
It's Kabuto!
Don't worry, I'll save you.

1163
01:24:21,431 --> 01:24:22,682
Who... are you...?

1164
01:24:39,032 --> 01:24:40,033
This way!

1165
01:24:43,286 --> 01:24:45,580
Damn it! Nanigashi's been killed!

1166
01:24:56,716 --> 01:24:59,552
<i>Mother didn't know me? Why?</i>

1167
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:04,557
<i>Why didn't she remember me?
Why?</i>

1168
01:25:05,989 --> 01:25:08,783
<i>If she doesn't remember me,
then who was I all this time?</i>

1169
01:25:09,966 --> 01:25:12,802
<i>What were all those things
I received from Mother?</i>

1170
01:25:13,988 --> 01:25:17,866
<i>My name, that I was
one of Mother's children,</i>

1171
01:25:18,113 --> 01:25:19,739
<i>even these glasses...</i>

1172
01:25:25,161 --> 01:25:26,412
Who...

1173
01:25:27,997 --> 01:25:29,040
are you?

1174
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:33,002
<i>It seems you no longer
see yourself clearly.</i>

1175
01:25:41,469 --> 01:25:43,596
You've become a fine shinobi.

1176
01:25:44,303 --> 01:25:47,556
I remember you... Kabuto.

1177
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:52,564
A-Aren't you...?!

1178
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:55,949
I've been watching you
this whole time.

1179
01:25:57,467 --> 01:25:59,344
Along with Nonou.

1180
01:25:59,631 --> 01:26:01,550
Come with me.

1181
01:26:02,073 --> 01:26:05,201
Then I'll tell you everything
you want to know.

1182
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:08,705
What I want to know?
What does that mean?

1183
01:26:09,639 --> 01:26:12,600
Why Mother targeted you...

1184
01:26:12,625 --> 01:26:15,795
and why she didn't
remember you at all.

1185
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:21,134
Don't you want to know... all that?

1186
01:26:30,768 --> 01:26:34,272
This is my hideout.
No one knows about it.

1187
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:38,193
Which means you are
my very first visitor.

1188
01:26:38,790 --> 01:26:40,792
Why did you bring me here?!

1189
01:26:41,295 --> 01:26:42,672
What are you going to do with me?

1190
01:26:42,697 --> 01:26:46,743
You are becoming
more and more curious.

1191
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:48,995
That's a good thing.

1192
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:52,999
People can never escape
their curiosity.

1193
01:26:53,791 --> 01:26:56,836
Which is why you followed me here.

1194
01:26:57,315 --> 01:26:59,484
Then tell me quickly!

1195
01:26:59,905 --> 01:27:02,658
You know what I want to know,
don't you?

1196
01:27:03,392 --> 01:27:09,849
To be frank, the Foundation had
decided to dispose of both you and Mother.

1197
01:27:11,478 --> 01:27:12,688
What do you mean?!

1198
01:27:13,267 --> 01:27:16,896
You both were too brilliant
as spies.

1199
01:27:19,848 --> 01:27:22,059
You ended up knowing too much.

1200
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:23,988
What?!

1201
01:27:24,030 --> 01:27:28,076
We risked our lives for so long, gathering
intel for the sake of the village...

1202
01:27:28,117 --> 01:27:29,118
And this is what we get?

1203
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:32,580
At times, intel becomes
even more powerful

1204
01:27:32,622 --> 01:27:35,124
than the mightiest jutsu or weapon.

1205
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:38,795
You are seen as a very dangerous
person right now.

1206
01:27:39,879 --> 01:27:44,367
Well, your fate had been decided
from the very beginning...

1207
01:27:45,426 --> 01:27:50,139
It was written in the scenario for you
to take each other out.

1208
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:53,476
Right after you left the orphanage,

1209
01:27:53,518 --> 01:27:58,481
Danzo revealed to Mother
the real reason why you had left.

1210
01:27:59,649 --> 01:28:04,404
That you sacrificed yourself and joined
the Foundation to secure funding for the orphanage.

1211
01:28:05,456 --> 01:28:09,251
Mother wished to liberate you
from the Foundation.

1212
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:14,163
As a condition of accepting her wish,
Danzo ordered the assassination

1213
01:28:14,281 --> 01:28:17,409
of a certain person
several years ago.

1214
01:28:18,584 --> 01:28:20,593
Ironically...

1215
01:28:21,045 --> 01:28:25,550
The target of the assassination...
was you.

1216
01:28:26,175 --> 01:28:28,803
I thought it was the condition
for my release!

1217
01:28:29,554 --> 01:28:31,723
Why didn't Mother realize
it was me?!

1218
01:28:32,515 --> 01:28:33,725
I told you...

1219
01:28:34,065 --> 01:28:38,354
The Foundation intended for the
two of you to take each other out.

1220
01:28:39,105 --> 01:28:41,357
And there was other trickery afoot.

1221
01:28:42,275 --> 01:28:43,484
Trickery?

1222
01:28:47,739 --> 01:28:50,533
You and Mother were sent into
separate enemy territories

1223
01:28:50,575 --> 01:28:52,453
so that you two would never meet,

1224
01:28:52,478 --> 01:28:58,011
and Mother was kept informed of your
well-being and progress through photos.

1225
01:28:59,208 --> 01:29:02,003
The photos of you
were skillfully replaced

1226
01:29:02,045 --> 01:29:04,255
with those of another
without her noticing it.

1227
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:09,218
Over time, Mother was made
to think someone else was you.

1228
01:29:11,156 --> 01:29:13,104
Gradual brainwashing.

1229
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:16,059
A common practice used
by the Foundation.

1230
01:29:16,684 --> 01:29:18,811
That's the other Kabuto.

1231
01:29:20,188 --> 01:29:23,775
And so, Nonou tried to kill you,

1232
01:29:23,816 --> 01:29:26,319
never in her wildest dreams
imagining that you were Kabuto...

1233
01:29:26,819 --> 01:29:31,032
She thought you were a double agent
who betrayed the village.

1234
01:29:32,658 --> 01:29:38,831
And the Foundation dispatched you
to deal with whoever was left...

1235
01:29:38,873 --> 01:29:40,166
Is that it?

1236
01:29:41,042 --> 01:29:43,795
For someone who knows
nothing about himself...

1237
01:29:43,961 --> 01:29:45,671
You're very perceptive.

1238
01:29:52,762 --> 01:29:55,765
I always wanted...
an explanation about who I was!

1239
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:58,601
And I thought
I had finally found it!

1240
01:29:58,785 --> 01:30:00,787
But thanks to you
Foundation bastards,

1241
01:30:00,812 --> 01:30:02,980
I've lost myself again!

1242
01:30:03,731 --> 01:30:06,651
These glasses were
what linked me to Mother!

1243
01:30:07,251 --> 01:30:09,879
The name she gave me
was mine and mine alone!

1244
01:30:10,043 --> 01:30:12,789
Mother was supposed
to be the parent

1245
01:30:13,056 --> 01:30:14,967
that didn't forget me,
no matter what!

1246
01:30:14,992 --> 01:30:16,744
But everything's wrong!

1247
01:30:17,002 --> 01:30:18,712
Then who in the world...

1248
01:30:19,247 --> 01:30:20,581
am I?!

1249
01:30:34,053 --> 01:30:38,391
You merely lack sufficient intel
with which to define yourself.

1250
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:42,395
It's just that neither the glasses, your
name, nor the fact that you're her child

1251
01:30:42,478 --> 01:30:45,481
were things that denote
who you really are.

1252
01:30:45,815 --> 01:30:47,567
And that's fine.

1253
01:30:48,049 --> 01:30:50,760
If you're not satisfied with
what you've had so far...

1254
01:30:51,112 --> 01:30:55,992
Just find other things and add
them onto yourself, one by one.

1255
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:58,411
If you plan on killing me...

1256
01:30:58,844 --> 01:31:01,096
why are you telling me all this?

1257
01:31:01,664 --> 01:31:05,710
I also want to know who or what I am.

1258
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:08,354
And I've been collecting
all sorts of things.

1259
01:31:13,217 --> 01:31:15,887
I repeatedly experiment on
and inspect these many things

1260
01:31:15,928 --> 01:31:18,446
I've accumulated bit by bit...

1261
01:31:18,471 --> 01:31:22,016
and store the gained knowledge
and abilities within myself.

1262
01:31:23,712 --> 01:31:26,757
And then, I undergo rebirth,

1263
01:31:26,782 --> 01:31:28,867
ever evolving toward
a more perfect me.

1264
01:31:29,442 --> 01:31:33,821
Afterward, I again obtain
even newer items.

1265
01:31:34,363 --> 01:31:35,656
This time...

1266
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:38,493
it's you.

1267
01:31:41,287 --> 01:31:46,083
There's no way you couldn't derive
who you are and what you are

1268
01:31:46,292 --> 01:31:51,964
by gathering all the intel and
things that exist in this world.

1269
01:31:52,632 --> 01:31:56,636
Why am I one of those things
to you?

1270
01:31:59,347 --> 01:32:03,437
Because I recognize your talent
more than anyone else in this world.

1271
01:32:04,003 --> 01:32:05,880
It would be a waste to kill you.

1272
01:32:06,771 --> 01:32:11,400
Besides, this medical research facility
was prepared just for you.

1273
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:13,653
What are you plotting?

1274
01:32:14,088 --> 01:32:16,423
Instead of the Foundation
which erases individuality...

1275
01:32:16,448 --> 01:32:19,050
I will create an organization
that guides individuality.

1276
01:32:19,075 --> 01:32:20,660
I will create a village.

1277
01:32:21,035 --> 01:32:24,789
The Village of the Hidden Sound...
that does not belong to any nation.

1278
01:32:25,039 --> 01:32:28,709
From this moment, you and I will
desert the Hidden Leaf's Foundation.

1279
01:32:28,793 --> 01:32:34,173
From this moment, I shall be your
superior, your brother, and your parent.

1280
01:32:34,919 --> 01:32:37,797
I will protect you from Danzo.

1281
01:32:38,928 --> 01:32:40,251
From this moment,

1282
01:32:40,276 --> 01:32:42,737
this will be your
new personal history:

1283
01:32:43,727 --> 01:32:46,271
When you were very young,
you were found and raised

1284
01:32:46,310 --> 01:32:50,731
by a Medical Corps Captain
following the Battle at Kikyo Pass.

1285
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:53,753
After returning to work under Danzo,

1286
01:32:53,778 --> 01:32:59,158
Nonou Yakushi kept her cover
as a captain of the Medical Unit...

1287
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:06,372
and you shall be reborn today
as her son, Kabuto Yakushi.

1288
01:33:11,127 --> 01:33:13,045
I am Orochimaru.

1289
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:17,040
If you want to know
who and what you are...

1290
01:33:17,592 --> 01:33:20,803
Come... be by my side.

1291
01:33:39,338 --> 01:33:42,550
There's another organization
I want to look into...

1292
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:44,410
Please leave it to me.

1293
01:33:45,143 --> 01:33:47,020
What is this organization?

1294
01:33:47,747 --> 01:33:48,789
The Akatsuki.

1295
01:33:57,214 --> 01:34:00,968
Bring me Orochimaru's human
experimentation data

1296
01:34:01,181 --> 01:34:05,331
and any intel on
the Reanimation Jutsu.

1297
01:34:06,098 --> 01:34:08,809
Understood, Lord Sasori.

1298
01:34:09,268 --> 01:34:11,646
You are useful.

1299
01:34:11,914 --> 01:34:16,835
You can erase your sound,
your scent, even yourself.

1300
01:34:17,223 --> 01:34:20,435
You're just like one of my puppets.

1301
01:35:07,661 --> 01:35:10,395
<i>If you're not satisfied with
what you've had so far...</i>

1302
01:35:11,789 --> 01:35:13,958
<i>Just find other things...</i>

1303
01:35:14,170 --> 01:35:17,132
<i>and add them onto yourself,
one by one.</i>

1304
01:35:22,591 --> 01:35:25,566
It's still... not enough...

1305
01:35:27,430 --> 01:35:31,100
This is... still not me...!

1306
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:39,108
That's why...
I've kept adding onto myself.

1307
01:35:42,010 --> 01:35:44,971
That's why I don't need
your lectures.

1308
01:35:45,108 --> 01:35:47,527
I need your abilities and intel.

1309
01:35:48,281 --> 01:35:52,644
Not only are you a Leaf shinobi,
you're of the famed Uchiha bloodline.

1310
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:55,791
You possess the Sharingan that
has awakened the Mangekyo...

1311
01:35:56,159 --> 01:35:59,037
You bore many secrets
and stopped a war...

1312
01:35:59,336 --> 01:36:02,006
You had many jutsu
and much power.

1313
01:36:02,756 --> 01:36:07,970
Itachi, you possessed many things
that made you who you are.

1314
01:36:08,345 --> 01:36:12,433
There is no finer Reanimation
out there of mine than you.

1315
01:36:13,684 --> 01:36:16,812
And my pawns are
part of my power!

1316
01:36:17,229 --> 01:36:18,314
You exaggerate...

1317
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:21,317
The reality is, I failed.

1318
01:36:23,325 --> 01:36:29,832
No, even though I mocked
the Uchiha name in front of you earlier,

1319
01:36:30,075 --> 01:36:32,578
I'm still quite envious
of that name.

1320
01:36:33,162 --> 01:36:36,865
The Uchiha name merely identifies
one's bloodline and clan membership.

1321
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:39,794
So it's meaningless for you
to claim it.

1322
01:36:40,169 --> 01:36:43,214
No... It does hold meaning.

1323
01:36:44,924 --> 01:36:47,551
Are you sure we can't kill him?

1324
01:36:47,823 --> 01:36:49,324
We're stuck playing catch-up!

1325
01:36:49,637 --> 01:36:51,472
I told you no!

1326
01:36:51,682 --> 01:36:53,392
He controls the battlefield right now.

1327
01:36:53,682 --> 01:36:54,683
Be patient.

1328
01:36:54,683 --> 01:36:56,685
Is the Izanami still not ready?

1329
01:36:56,710 --> 01:36:58,211
He's about to come after us!

1330
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:04,527
I'm already on him.

1331
01:37:05,274 --> 01:37:07,276
It's just going to take
a little more time.

1332
01:37:07,780 --> 01:37:10,658
Lord Orochimaru once said...

1333
01:37:10,762 --> 01:37:12,929
<i>Sakon! Demon Twin Jutsu!</i>

1334
01:37:15,704 --> 01:37:18,624
<i>Jirobo! Earth Style:
Terra Shield!</i>

1335
01:37:26,423 --> 01:37:29,343
"If you want to know who
and what you are,

1336
01:37:29,552 --> 01:37:32,429
"all you need to do is gather
every single thing

1337
01:37:32,454 --> 01:37:35,665
"and piece of information
that exists in this world!"

1338
01:37:36,725 --> 01:37:37,852
<i>Kidomaru!</i>

1339
01:37:37,977 --> 01:37:39,353
<i>Spiral Web!</i>

1340
01:37:42,439 --> 01:37:44,441
These threads can't be cut
with a blade!

1341
01:37:44,692 --> 01:37:45,818
– <i>Amaterasu!</i>
– <i>Amaterasu!</i>

1342
01:37:50,364 --> 01:37:51,574
<i>Kimimaro!</i>

1343
01:37:52,992 --> 01:37:55,578
<i>Macabre Bone Pulse!
Bracken Dance!</i>

1344
01:37:57,982 --> 01:38:00,776
He's laid down the spider silk
all the way to the back.

1345
01:38:00,875 --> 01:38:03,085
I'll get the one behind us!
Take the front, brother!

1346
01:38:03,230 --> 01:38:04,690
Can you still use the Susano'o?

1347
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:05,671
Yeah.

1348
01:38:05,713 --> 01:38:07,673
<i>Inferno Style: Flame Control!</i>

1349
01:38:17,099 --> 01:38:19,018
Running away to the back?

1350
01:38:20,644 --> 01:38:22,271
Well, it's no use!

1351
01:38:22,897 --> 01:38:25,816
<i>Tayuya! Demon Flute:
Chains of Fantasia!</i>

1352
01:38:30,279 --> 01:38:31,488
Are you okay, Sasu—?!

1353
01:38:36,869 --> 01:38:38,162
A genjutsu, huh?

1354
01:38:39,079 --> 01:38:42,833
Even your specialty, Susano'o,
cannot stifle sound...

1355
01:38:43,083 --> 01:38:44,335
I knew it...

1356
01:38:45,613 --> 01:38:47,699
Now you're immobilized.

1357
01:38:48,130 --> 01:38:49,423
All that's left is...

1358
01:38:51,583 --> 01:38:53,960
to take you into me
using Lord Orochimaru!

1359
01:38:59,183 --> 01:39:00,976
Well, Sasuke...

1360
01:39:01,018 --> 01:39:04,939
Do you recognize
this current form of mine?

1361
01:39:05,623 --> 01:39:06,624
<i>That's...!</i>

1362
01:39:06,649 --> 01:39:07,816
Kabuto...

1363
01:39:08,108 --> 01:39:09,902
You are not Orochimaru.

1364
01:39:10,527 --> 01:39:13,030
It's fine to imitate someone
you respect...

1365
01:39:13,811 --> 01:39:17,095
But don't remake yourself
into him, to that extent.

1366
01:39:20,287 --> 01:39:25,167
The majority of people start out
by mimicking someone.

1367
01:39:26,085 --> 01:39:29,171
Like how Sasuke mimicked you.

1368
01:39:32,383 --> 01:39:36,053
Such behavior is merely a process
to help one mature!

1369
01:39:36,178 --> 01:39:39,848
Don't use it as a cloak to
deceive yourself, like you've done!

1370
01:39:41,896 --> 01:39:45,733
You gain nothing when
you attach your self-value

1371
01:39:45,813 --> 01:39:50,318
to something external that's admirable
and praiseworthy to you.

1372
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:54,738
I'll say this one last time.

1373
01:39:55,814 --> 01:39:58,275
Don't mislead yourself with lies.

1374
01:39:58,617 --> 01:40:02,413
Those who cannot acknowledge
themselves will invariably fail.

1375
01:40:04,164 --> 01:40:08,335
Fail? The way I am now?

1376
01:40:09,336 --> 01:40:10,629
How?!

1377
01:40:11,630 --> 01:40:13,674
Sasuke... Look into my eyes!

1378
01:40:15,576 --> 01:40:16,885
I understand!

1379
01:40:17,094 --> 01:40:18,762
<i>Genjutsu... Sharingan!</i>

1380
01:40:18,804 --> 01:40:19,847
<i>Tsukuyomi!</i>

1381
01:40:34,095 --> 01:40:35,805
I shall now engage the Izanami.

1382
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:39,783
You have already... failed.

1383
01:40:45,330 --> 01:40:46,331
Is it over?

1384
01:40:52,550 --> 01:40:56,095
A genius that had everything
would never understand...

1385
01:40:57,134 --> 01:41:00,596
I just want to be who
and what I am!

1386
01:41:02,014 --> 01:41:03,891
I won't let anyone stop me.

1387
01:41:06,274 --> 01:41:08,137
Sa... suke...

1388
01:41:16,149 --> 01:41:18,113
<i>Fire Style: Fireball jutsu!</i>

1389
01:41:18,614 --> 01:41:20,741
<i>Water Style: Giant Waterfall!</i>

1390
01:41:55,317 --> 01:41:57,027
The same moves.

1391
01:41:57,361 --> 01:41:59,363
As expected...
It makes it easy for me to counter.

1392
01:42:00,405 --> 01:42:04,618
I already told you that as long as
I have my power of recovery,

1393
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:06,995
wounding me is meaningless.

1394
01:42:08,455 --> 01:42:12,376
Since I shut off my vision,
genjutsu won't work on me.

1395
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:15,203
You have no chance of winning.

1396
01:42:15,774 --> 01:42:18,860
Your fate is already in my hands.

1397
01:42:19,895 --> 01:42:23,148
Thanks to the Uchiha's other
Forbidden Jutsu.

1398
01:42:23,262 --> 01:42:24,638
That is...

1399
01:42:28,083 --> 01:42:32,612
Well then...
Shall we put that to the test?!

1400
01:42:35,354 --> 01:42:36,452
... the Izanami!

1401
01:42:40,612 --> 01:42:42,865
Sasuke, do not leave my side.

1402
01:42:45,989 --> 01:42:48,158
Why this is just like déjà vu.

1403
01:42:50,122 --> 01:42:51,415
I'm bored...

1404
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:54,459
Let's end this fight already.

1405
01:42:56,108 --> 01:42:58,652
Your fate may be in my hands now...

1406
01:42:59,117 --> 01:43:01,994
but you're the only one
who can truly decide

1407
01:43:02,019 --> 01:43:03,479
how that fate shapes your destiny.

1408
01:43:04,877 --> 01:43:06,921
Remember what I've told you.

1409
01:43:08,125 --> 01:43:09,710
And think hard.

1410
01:43:11,226 --> 01:43:14,563
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

1411
01:43:15,696 --> 01:43:18,115
Enough of your word games.

1412
01:43:18,280 --> 01:43:21,783
I will have everything...
I am the strongest of all!

1413
01:43:22,529 --> 01:43:24,656
That is fact!

1414
01:43:25,908 --> 01:43:29,828
He who forgives oneself,
who can acknowledge one's true self...

1415
01:43:31,496 --> 01:43:33,707
is the most powerful of all!

1416
01:43:36,084 --> 01:43:37,461
Losers...

1417
01:43:38,629 --> 01:43:39,713
should be quiet!

1418
01:43:46,970 --> 01:43:48,013
<i>This is...</i>

1419
01:43:50,799 --> 01:43:53,635
<i>What's... going on?</i>

1420
01:44:06,073 --> 01:44:09,493
<i>Why? That horn's already
been cut off!</i>

1421
01:44:10,827 --> 01:44:13,997
<i>How? I have no sight...</i>

1422
01:44:14,122 --> 01:44:16,333
<i>I should be invulnerable to genjutsu.</i>

1423
01:44:16,375 --> 01:44:18,085
<i>But this is clearly a...!</i>

1424
01:44:37,562 --> 01:44:39,273
What did you do to me?!

1425
01:44:40,315 --> 01:44:43,068
You're in my visual jutsu.

1426
01:44:45,275 --> 01:44:46,527
Impossible!

1427
01:44:48,206 --> 01:44:49,239
It's the Izanami!

1428
01:44:52,661 --> 01:44:53,704
How...?

1429
01:44:54,246 --> 01:44:57,040
No matter.

1430
01:44:57,416 --> 01:44:59,543
No one can stop me!

1431
01:45:00,002 --> 01:45:02,045
There's nothing I can't do!

1432
01:45:20,539 --> 01:45:21,832
I told you...

1433
01:45:22,196 --> 01:45:24,615
I hold your fate in my hands.

1434
01:45:25,402 --> 01:45:27,529
Itachi Uchiha!

1435
01:45:36,805 --> 01:45:39,266
<i>If this is a genjutsu...</i>

1436
01:45:42,002 --> 01:45:43,211
<i>Release!</i>

1437
01:46:09,839 --> 01:46:11,090
<i>Calm down...</i>

1438
01:46:11,382 --> 01:46:13,050
<i>This is an Uchiha genjutsu.</i>

1439
01:46:13,265 --> 01:46:17,644
<i>Moreover, Itachi cast it,
so it won't be easy to undo.</i>

1440
01:46:17,721 --> 01:46:21,350
<i>But there are many ways
to undo a genjutsu!</i>

1441
01:46:21,375 --> 01:46:22,376
It's useless.

1442
01:46:22,584 --> 01:46:24,503
Recall my words to you.

1443
01:46:25,337 --> 01:46:29,508
Fine! I'll use the same trick
you two used!

1444
01:46:35,013 --> 01:46:37,265
<i>Tayuya! Demon Flute:
Chains of Fantasia!</i>

1445
01:46:41,311 --> 01:46:43,438
<i>This will switch from Itachi's control
over genjutsu</i>

1446
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:46,024
<i>to Tayuya's control.</i>

1447
01:46:58,120 --> 01:46:59,413
Then, I'll do this!

1448
01:46:59,621 --> 01:47:01,957
<i>Sage Art: Inorganic Animation!</i>

1449
01:47:13,068 --> 01:47:15,320
This area is under my control!

1450
01:47:15,788 --> 01:47:17,623
I'll retreat for now...

1451
01:47:30,485 --> 01:47:31,445
<i>Damn it!</i>

1452
01:47:31,818 --> 01:47:33,470
Don't mess with me!

1453
01:47:43,415 --> 01:47:47,669
He cannot escape
this samsara, this loop.

1454
01:47:49,421 --> 01:47:53,884
This is the other Forbidden Jutsu...
the companion to Izanagi.

1455
01:47:56,386 --> 01:47:58,180
The jutsu that decides one's fate...

1456
01:47:59,723 --> 01:48:01,391
This is the Izanami.

1457
01:48:03,101 --> 01:48:05,395
It makes it easier to cast
my real visual genjutsu on him

1458
01:48:05,437 --> 01:48:08,148
by keeping him trapped in
a small loop like this.

1459
01:48:09,232 --> 01:48:13,069
So Kabuto's trapped in
your loop now?

1460
01:48:14,070 --> 01:48:15,655
And that's the Izanami?

1461
01:48:16,615 --> 01:48:17,616
When did you cast it?

1462
01:48:19,242 --> 01:48:22,454
The first time Kabuto stabbed me
with that blade.

1463
01:48:27,834 --> 01:48:29,127
Back then, huh?

1464
01:48:30,587 --> 01:48:31,922
But how?

1465
01:48:32,756 --> 01:48:36,635
You mentioned a visual jutsu
that is possible without sight.

1466
01:48:37,724 --> 01:48:40,268
How can visual jutsu work
without eyesight?

1467
01:48:41,055 --> 01:48:43,767
Izanami is a visual jutsu that
works with the physical senses

1468
01:48:43,808 --> 01:48:46,603
of both yourself and your opponents.

1469
01:48:47,967 --> 01:48:51,137
As you are battling your opponent,
you take a record, like a photograph,

1470
01:48:51,344 --> 01:48:54,619
of the physical senses that
both you and your opponent

1471
01:48:54,644 --> 01:48:56,854
experiencing during that instant,
with your visual jutsu.

1472
01:48:57,906 --> 01:48:59,616
We'll call that A.

1473
01:49:01,025 --> 01:49:02,735
As time progresses,

1474
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:04,929
you find "B" is a more
important moment,

1475
01:49:05,121 --> 01:49:08,458
then you record "C" and
so on with Sharingan.

1476
01:49:09,876 --> 01:49:12,170
Then you recreate
those exact physical senses.

1477
01:49:12,212 --> 01:49:16,967
So you use your visual prowess to
create an exact copy of A.

1478
01:49:16,967 --> 01:49:18,718
We'll call this A.

1479
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:22,697
By overlaying and connecting A to A,

1480
01:49:22,722 --> 01:49:26,101
the Izanami also links
a path for B and C

1481
01:49:26,357 --> 01:49:29,068
to create an infinite loop within
a fixed time.

1482
01:49:29,646 --> 01:49:32,315
In other words, it's the power
to create an infinite loop.

1483
01:49:33,524 --> 01:49:36,360
Naturally, all in exchange for
one's own sight of course,

1484
01:49:36,486 --> 01:49:38,113
exactly like Izanagi.

1485
01:49:39,447 --> 01:49:42,200
So Kabuto's consciousness
is trapped inside

1486
01:49:42,242 --> 01:49:47,330
fighting a phantom you and
a phantom me for all eternity.

1487
01:49:48,432 --> 01:49:49,474
No.

1488
01:49:49,499 --> 01:49:52,627
The Izanami was developed
to admonish

1489
01:49:52,898 --> 01:49:55,567
and save an Izanagi user.

1490
01:49:56,381 --> 01:49:57,674
What does that mean?

1491
01:49:58,406 --> 01:50:01,201
You know a little about
the Izanagi already.

1492
01:50:02,387 --> 01:50:06,600
It's called the perfect Uchiha visual
jutsu, designed to change destiny.

1493
01:50:08,143 --> 01:50:10,687
If something does not go
the way you want it to,

1494
01:50:10,729 --> 01:50:13,398
you can just erase that outcome
and start all over.

1495
01:50:13,982 --> 01:50:18,194
Ultimately, you can pick and
choose the most desirable end result.

1496
01:50:18,847 --> 01:50:20,964
What was created

1497
01:50:20,989 --> 01:50:25,243
in order to stop this inter-clan
rivalry over the Izanagi...

1498
01:50:25,285 --> 01:50:27,162
is the Izanami.

1499
01:50:28,413 --> 01:50:32,584
In the first place, reality is a
product of chance that we call fate.

1500
01:50:33,001 --> 01:50:34,794
We can't predict it.

1501
01:50:35,629 --> 01:50:39,007
But Izanagi can twist around
an inconvenient reality

1502
01:50:39,032 --> 01:50:40,658
and lead it to a new fate.

1503
01:50:41,977 --> 01:50:46,330
At a whim, the user can change
the original reality into a new one.

1504
01:50:47,121 --> 01:50:51,308
To the enemy, a fallen opponent
will revive, so it's a terrifying jutsu.

1505
01:50:52,437 --> 01:50:55,023
The Izanami is set up to take someone
who is using the Izanagi

1506
01:50:55,023 --> 01:50:57,942
to change the outcome
to benefit oneself,

1507
01:50:57,942 --> 01:51:01,029
and cause them to endlessly
circle around in a loop.

1508
01:51:02,419 --> 01:51:05,672
I believed that Izanagi was
the ultimate visual jutsu.

1509
01:51:06,826 --> 01:51:09,579
But that means the Izanami is
a far superior visual jutsu.

1510
01:51:10,622 --> 01:51:13,416
Izanami forms a loop

1511
01:51:13,752 --> 01:51:16,580
around the physical sensation
of Izanagi twisting reality.

1512
01:51:17,453 --> 01:51:20,540
The Izanami is a jutsu meant
for stopping the Izanagi.

1513
01:51:21,101 --> 01:51:24,187
There's an escape route built
into the loop.

1514
01:51:24,844 --> 01:51:30,038
Originally, it was a jutsu to save Uchiha
comrades from arrogance and negligence.

1515
01:51:30,684 --> 01:51:34,813
It's to stop you from taking
the easy way out with jutsu.

1516
01:51:35,271 --> 01:51:38,775
Once one accepts the original outcome
and stops trying to run from it,

1517
01:51:38,775 --> 01:51:40,985
the loop will stop.

1518
01:51:42,487 --> 01:51:45,365
This jutsu guides you toward
accepting your fate,

1519
01:51:45,407 --> 01:51:47,492
instead of relying on jutsu
to change it.

1520
01:51:48,451 --> 01:51:51,538
But a jutsu that has an escape
is too dangerous to use in actual combat.

1521
01:51:52,706 --> 01:51:55,500
That's why Izanami is
a Forbidden Jutsu.

1522
01:51:56,316 --> 01:52:00,529
If Kabuto stops trying
to transform himself,

1523
01:52:00,907 --> 01:52:02,549
he can stop the loop.

1524
01:52:07,053 --> 01:52:10,515
The strife-filled history
of the Uchiha...

1525
01:52:10,994 --> 01:52:16,207
The arrogance and recklessness
of those who used Izanagi...

1526
01:52:17,522 --> 01:52:22,318
and how they clashed and
were stopped by Izanami...

1527
01:52:23,420 --> 01:52:25,338
I understand now

1528
01:52:25,363 --> 01:52:27,725
why both Izanagi and Izanami
came to be Forbidden Jutsu.

1529
01:52:28,402 --> 01:52:30,862
And I see how one must learn
from the past

1530
01:52:30,887 --> 01:52:34,224
and accept one's fate
and move on.

1531
01:52:36,666 --> 01:52:41,546
But... why bother
casting this on Kabuto?

1532
01:52:42,424 --> 01:52:44,385
If there's a way to escape...

1533
01:52:44,410 --> 01:52:47,163
He reminds me of the old me.

1534
01:52:48,303 --> 01:52:52,599
He thinks by acquiring all there is,
he can accomplish whatever he wants.

1535
01:52:53,475 --> 01:52:58,952
He makes himself believe that
he can't fail, and lies to himself.

1536
01:53:00,291 --> 01:53:05,838
I stopped listening to anyone else.
I stopped trusting anyone.

1537
01:53:07,046 --> 01:53:09,924
In Kabuto's case,
he is so deluded

1538
01:53:10,454 --> 01:53:13,948
that he thinks all these powers
are his and his alone.

1539
01:53:15,872 --> 01:53:17,582
I empathize with him.

1540
01:53:18,333 --> 01:53:21,252
We were both used by
the shinobi world...

1541
01:53:21,419 --> 01:53:25,465
He can neither forgive himself
nor accept himself as he truly is.

1542
01:53:26,633 --> 01:53:29,511
What he is doing is certainly wrong.

1543
01:53:30,178 --> 01:53:34,057
But he's not completely to blame
for not being able to realize that.

1544
01:53:36,159 --> 01:53:38,286
My chance has passed,

1545
01:53:38,311 --> 01:53:40,605
but he can still forgive himself
before he dies.

1546
01:53:41,523 --> 01:53:46,110
Why would you ever feel
like you need to help him do that?

1547
01:53:46,361 --> 01:53:50,156
He is not like you.
You were perfect!

1548
01:53:50,240 --> 01:53:51,574
Sasuke...

1549
01:53:52,408 --> 01:53:56,120
I tried to control you
with the visual jutsu

1550
01:53:56,162 --> 01:53:59,040
called Koto Amatsukami.

1551
01:54:00,291 --> 01:54:03,127
I treated you like a child

1552
01:54:03,169 --> 01:54:05,588
because I thought you
needed my protection.

1553
01:54:05,630 --> 01:54:07,841
I didn't trust your strength.

1554
01:54:09,425 --> 01:54:14,138
It may be that a perfect being
does not exist at all in the world.

1555
01:54:15,431 --> 01:54:19,394
Sometimes two who seem to be opposites
are actually two sides of the same coin.

1556
01:54:19,908 --> 01:54:24,360
They can only succeed when
they actually work together.

1557
01:54:25,522 --> 01:54:28,008
Like the Izanagi and Izanami.

1558
01:54:28,987 --> 01:54:32,991
Look at me, and find in yourself
what I was unable to find in myself.

1559
01:54:34,492 --> 01:54:38,288
Do not say I was perfect.

1560
01:54:39,415 --> 01:54:40,372
First...

1561
01:54:49,568 --> 01:54:51,069
Impossible!

1562
01:54:51,603 --> 01:54:53,761
I will be a perfect being!

1563
01:54:55,680 --> 01:54:58,683
This is... not me!

1564
01:54:59,491 --> 01:55:01,618
How long will you imitate Orochimaru?

1565
01:55:04,939 --> 01:55:08,359
If you want to exit this loop,
acknowledge your mistakes!

1566
01:55:08,597 --> 01:55:09,581
Shut up!

1567
01:55:10,325 --> 01:55:12,702
<i>I know he's going to come at me
with a Fire Style Jutsu.</i>

1568
01:55:12,994 --> 01:55:14,495
<i>Water Style: Water Dragon—</i>

1569
01:55:14,530 --> 01:55:16,073
<i>Water Style: Water Dragon Missile!</i>

1570
01:55:20,830 --> 01:55:23,166
<i>He anticipated that jutsu
with Sharingan!</i>

1571
01:55:32,216 --> 01:55:34,636
How did I get this wrong?

1572
01:55:34,802 --> 01:55:38,056
Where did I...
make a mistake?

1573
01:55:40,266 --> 01:55:44,729
All I ever wanted
was someone... to appreciate...

1574
01:55:44,729 --> 01:55:47,023
who I was!

1575
01:55:48,149 --> 01:55:50,652
All I wanted was to
be acknowledged!

1576
01:55:52,612 --> 01:55:56,407
Where is the mistake in that?!

1577
01:55:59,452 --> 01:56:00,578
First...

1578
01:56:00,578 --> 01:56:04,457
you had to accept yourself
as you were.

1579
01:56:05,084 --> 01:56:08,629
Then you wouldn't have
had to lie to anyone.

1580
01:56:09,321 --> 01:56:11,489
To you... or to me.

1581
01:56:12,215 --> 01:56:14,717
If you lie to yourself,
how can you have friends?

1582
01:56:14,759 --> 01:56:17,136
How can you trust or
be trustworthy?

1583
01:56:17,637 --> 01:56:20,765
Lies will keep you from
ever seeing your true self.

1584
01:56:24,227 --> 01:56:27,897
<i>If I wasn't trapped here...</i>

1585
01:56:28,088 --> 01:56:30,191
<i>I'd have won this war by now.</i>

1586
01:56:30,608 --> 01:56:33,152
<i>I'd be sleeping by now.</i>

1587
01:56:36,030 --> 01:56:38,074
Damn you, Itachi!

1588
01:56:52,669 --> 01:56:54,004
It's 9 o'clock already?

1589
01:56:54,449 --> 01:56:55,492
Something wrong?

1590
01:56:55,925 --> 01:56:56,926
No...

1591
01:56:57,499 --> 01:57:01,806
I just wish we could wrap this up quickly
so I could get a good night's sleep.

1592
01:57:02,390 --> 01:57:08,563
They never tell us lackeys
what's going on.

1593
01:57:09,022 --> 01:57:10,148
That's true.

1594
01:57:11,274 --> 01:57:13,735
So, what are you going to do
when this war is over?

1595
01:57:14,819 --> 01:57:17,071
Well, I'll start by going home.

1596
01:57:17,822 --> 01:57:22,243
If the war ends and the Five
Great Nations continue to be allies...

1597
01:57:22,535 --> 01:57:25,496
then maybe my little brother who's been
on a mission for a long time,

1598
01:57:25,538 --> 01:57:26,789
can finally come home.

1599
01:57:28,499 --> 01:57:31,210
I envy those who have
a home to return to...

1600
01:57:32,419 --> 01:57:35,297
You want to come with me?

1601
01:57:35,381 --> 01:57:36,299
Huh?

1602
01:57:36,299 --> 01:57:38,926
My home is an orphanage.

1603
01:57:39,469 --> 01:57:42,221
And if my kid brother's back,
he can take a look at your wounds.

1604
01:57:43,890 --> 01:57:46,100
I appreciate that, Urushi!

1605
01:57:47,147 --> 01:57:50,150
<i>I really hope
you come back this time...</i>

1606
01:57:53,483 --> 01:57:54,609
<i>Kabuto.</i>

1607
01:58:03,201 --> 01:58:05,661
I'll stop the Reanimation Jutsu now.

1608
01:58:11,167 --> 01:58:14,170
And... all the reanimated dead
will fade away.

1609
01:58:16,567 --> 01:58:18,945
That should end the war.

1610
01:58:20,176 --> 01:58:21,594
But...

1611
01:58:23,036 --> 01:58:24,537
you'll be gone too, brother.

1612
01:58:25,756 --> 01:58:31,646
I have protected my village as
Itachi Uchiha of the Leaf once again.

1613
01:58:32,897 --> 01:58:34,982
I have no more regrets.

1614
01:58:35,253 --> 01:58:36,546
Why?!

1615
01:58:36,692 --> 01:58:40,905
Why help the very village that
put you where you are now?

1616
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:44,075
You may be able to forgive,
but I cannot!

1617
01:58:44,450 --> 01:58:46,285
You have no more regrets?

1618
01:58:46,828 --> 01:58:50,373
What about what
you've made me become?!

1619
01:58:54,752 --> 01:58:57,630
I'm not the one who can
change you, Sasuke.

1620
01:58:59,634 --> 01:59:04,680
But I can stop this jutsu.

1621
01:59:05,447 --> 01:59:09,034
That will fulfill my promise
to Naruto, at least.

1622
01:59:12,145 --> 01:59:13,980
I will stop the Reanimation Jutsu!

1623
01:59:14,897 --> 01:59:16,315
Tell me the signs!

1624
01:59:17,817 --> 01:59:18,856
<i>Tsukuyomi!</i>

1625
01:59:30,710 --> 01:59:32,420
<i>I kept my promise.</i>

1626
01:59:32,665 --> 01:59:35,418
<i>I leave the rest to you... Naruto.</i>

1627
01:59:37,494 --> 01:59:38,912
<i>That's it, huh...</i>

1628
01:59:39,706 --> 01:59:41,082
All right... Rat

1629
01:59:44,417 --> 01:59:45,418
Ox...

1630
01:59:47,770 --> 01:59:48,761
Monkey...

1631
01:59:54,353 --> 01:59:57,773
I guess...
it won't matter what I say, will it?

1632
02:00:01,609 --> 02:00:03,444
When I saw you...

1633
02:00:03,696 --> 02:00:05,489
I followed you in order
to confirm

1634
02:00:05,531 --> 02:00:08,659
whether or not Tobi and Danzo
spoke the truth.

1635
02:00:08,949 --> 02:00:12,077
But that wasn't all I confirmed.

1636
02:00:14,335 --> 02:00:16,713
When I'm with you,
the past comes flooding back.

1637
02:00:17,630 --> 02:00:20,675
The feelings I had as a child,
of adoration for my big brother.

1638
02:00:26,719 --> 02:00:28,679
That's why...

1639
02:00:28,679 --> 02:00:33,601
the closer I get to you and
how we used to be back then,

1640
02:00:34,185 --> 02:00:35,895
the more I understand you.

1641
02:00:37,063 --> 02:00:41,776
And the more I hate the Leaf Village
for causing you so much pain!

1642
02:00:42,026 --> 02:00:44,946
I hate it more than ever!

1643
02:00:46,530 --> 02:00:49,116
I know what you want me to do.

1644
02:00:50,201 --> 02:00:53,579
And because you're my big brother,
you'll disapprove.

1645
02:00:54,205 --> 02:00:57,300
It's because I'm your brother that,
no matter what you say,

1646
02:00:57,325 --> 02:00:59,036
you're not going to stop me!

1647
02:00:59,919 --> 02:01:05,299
Even if you protect the village now...
I will still destroy it someday.

1648
02:01:06,497 --> 02:01:07,294
Tiger...

1649
02:01:10,386 --> 02:01:11,387
Dragon...

1650
02:01:14,678 --> 02:01:15,721
Goodbye.

1651
02:01:16,811 --> 02:01:17,812
Boar...

1652
02:01:19,645 --> 02:01:21,731
<i>Reanimation Jutsu... Release!</i>

1653
02:01:25,987 --> 02:01:27,238
<i>Big brother...</i>

1654
02:02:12,742 --> 02:02:13,868
Lord Tsuchikage...

1655
02:02:14,744 --> 02:02:17,663
It's unfortunate...
But I think this is the end.

1656
02:02:17,747 --> 02:02:19,540
Silence, Mizukage!

1657
02:02:20,041 --> 02:02:22,752
I'm not giving up yet!

1658
02:02:32,386 --> 02:02:33,846
What's going on?

1659
02:02:40,019 --> 02:02:42,313
Did something happen
to the jutsu user?

1660
02:02:50,654 --> 02:02:52,740
There's still time...

1661
02:03:00,808 --> 02:03:03,895
I feel like my consciousness
is slowly fading...

1662
02:03:05,805 --> 02:03:10,601
I need to tell you everything
before we part.

1663
02:03:12,176 --> 02:03:13,969
There's no need to lie anymore.

1664
02:03:16,601 --> 02:03:18,436
The night I left you,

1665
02:03:20,226 --> 02:03:25,189
I did do everything Danzo
and Tobi told you.

1666
02:03:27,525 --> 02:03:30,820
I'll show you... the whole truth.

1667
02:03:41,732 --> 02:03:44,652
<i>These are...
Itachi's memories!</i>

1668
02:03:46,335 --> 02:03:49,463
It no longer looks like the Uchiha
coup d'état can be prevented.

1669
02:03:50,256 --> 02:03:54,176
And if civil war erupts in the Leaf,
other nations are certain to invade.

1670
02:03:54,635 --> 02:03:56,345
Real war will break out.

1671
02:03:56,971 --> 02:04:00,558
When I tried to stop the coup d'état
with the Kotoamatsukami,

1672
02:04:00,876 --> 02:04:03,087
Danzo stole my right eye.

1673
02:04:03,936 --> 02:04:05,855
He doesn't trust me.

1674
02:04:06,564 --> 02:04:08,858
He intends to protect
the village his way,

1675
02:04:08,899 --> 02:04:10,651
no matter what it takes
or how it looks.

1676
02:04:11,110 --> 02:04:13,112
I suspect he'll come after
my left eye as well.

1677
02:04:13,237 --> 02:04:15,781
So I want to give it to you
before he has a chance.

1678
02:04:17,158 --> 02:04:18,200
<i>Shisui...</i>

1679
02:04:19,326 --> 02:04:21,704
You're the only person I can count on,
my best friend.

1680
02:04:22,163 --> 02:04:26,292
Please protect this village...
and the honor of the Uchiha name.

1681
02:04:28,294 --> 02:04:30,963
We cannot allow such a thing!

1682
02:04:31,338 --> 02:04:35,676
If they are going to start a revolution
and usurp our power,

1683
02:04:35,877 --> 02:04:40,073
we have no choice but to brand
the Uchiha as traitors of the Leaf!

1684
02:04:40,098 --> 02:04:41,474
Wait, Koharu.

1685
02:04:42,110 --> 02:04:43,736
Don't rush to such a decision.

1686
02:04:44,101 --> 02:04:48,606
But Hiruzen, the Uchiha Clan
will not be dissuaded.

1687
02:04:49,106 --> 02:04:53,944
We must take measures
to avoid mayhem.

1688
02:04:56,512 --> 02:04:59,181
And that includes innocent children.

1689
02:05:00,296 --> 02:05:02,882
Do not say such things
before Itachi.

1690
02:05:03,454 --> 02:05:08,083
Besides, taking on the Uchiha
will be no easy task.

1691
02:05:08,542 --> 02:05:11,128
There's got to be some sort
of strategy we can use!

1692
02:05:11,378 --> 02:05:13,339
We have no time to waste.

1693
02:05:13,766 --> 02:05:17,954
We must strike preemptively.

1694
02:05:18,498 --> 02:05:22,043
If we join forces with
our respective ANBU Black Ops

1695
02:05:22,068 --> 02:05:23,991
and launch a surprise attack
from behind,

1696
02:05:24,016 --> 02:05:25,518
it will be over in no time.

1697
02:05:26,644 --> 02:05:28,687
The Uchiha are old
comrades in arms.

1698
02:05:29,897 --> 02:05:32,691
I want to settle this
with words first before force.

1699
02:05:33,655 --> 02:05:35,657
I will come up with a strategy.

1700
02:05:37,014 --> 02:05:38,265
Itachi...

1701
02:05:38,524 --> 02:05:42,528
Buy me some time,
however little it may be.

1702
02:05:45,176 --> 02:05:47,178
Despite what Lord Third said,

1703
02:05:47,203 --> 02:05:50,122
he will move to protect the Leaf
if push comes to shove.

1704
02:05:50,266 --> 02:05:52,101
That's the kind of man he is.

1705
02:05:53,921 --> 02:05:56,882
In which case even Hiruzen,
as Hokage,

1706
02:05:56,907 --> 02:05:59,910
will have no choice
but to take decisive measures.

1707
02:06:00,412 --> 02:06:04,249
Whether it results in war or not,
the moment the coup d'état happens,

1708
02:06:04,274 --> 02:06:07,361
the Uchiha will seal their fate
of annihilation.

1709
02:06:08,143 --> 02:06:11,647
Including your innocent
little brother.

1710
02:06:12,523 --> 02:06:16,610
However, there is a way to spare just your
little brother prior to the coup d'état.

1711
02:06:17,439 --> 02:06:18,774
If things come to pass,

1712
02:06:18,799 --> 02:06:21,426
your brother will likely come
to know the truth.

1713
02:06:22,032 --> 02:06:26,370
And if he witnesses Leaf shinobi
slaughter his entire clan,

1714
02:06:26,412 --> 02:06:29,039
it will give him a vengeful heart
towards the Leaf.

1715
02:06:29,873 --> 02:06:33,919
And then unfortunately,
he will have to die as well.

1716
02:06:35,105 --> 02:06:36,369
Is that a threat?

1717
02:06:36,783 --> 02:06:39,702
No, I just want you
to make a choice.

1718
02:06:43,429 --> 02:06:45,347
Either align with the Uchiha,

1719
02:06:45,347 --> 02:06:49,810
launch the coup d'état,
and die along with your clan...

1720
02:06:50,394 --> 02:06:52,229
Or side with the Leaf,

1721
02:06:52,271 --> 02:06:54,982
save your little brother
before the coup d'état

1722
02:06:55,100 --> 02:06:57,644
and then help us eliminate
all other Uchiha.

1723
02:06:58,485 --> 02:07:00,195
No matter what,

1724
02:07:00,716 --> 02:07:04,700
things must be quelled before any mayhem
can arise in order to protect the village.

1725
02:07:05,534 --> 02:07:08,495
And the only shinobi who can be
entrusted with this mission...

1726
02:07:08,537 --> 02:07:11,332
is you, a double agent
for both the Uchiha and the Leaf.

1727
02:07:11,373 --> 02:07:14,752
There is no one else... Itachi.

1728
02:07:17,626 --> 02:07:22,005
This will be the most
painful mission for you.

1729
02:07:22,134 --> 02:07:23,470
But in exchange,

1730
02:07:23,495 --> 02:07:27,415
it will allow your little brother
to be spared.

1731
02:07:28,223 --> 02:07:31,644
I know you care about the village
as much as I...

1732
02:07:31,935 --> 02:07:34,855
Will you accept this mission?

1733
02:07:49,620 --> 02:07:51,413
How do you know about me?

1734
02:07:52,452 --> 02:07:55,872
You slipped through
extra tight Leaf Security

1735
02:07:56,001 --> 02:07:58,671
and went to examine
Nakano Shrine's secret stone tablet.

1736
02:07:59,213 --> 02:08:02,132
Only the Uchiha know its location.

1737
02:08:03,509 --> 02:08:06,011
Since then, I've kept an eye
on your movements,

1738
02:08:06,036 --> 02:08:09,539
and looked into what kind of character
you are and what your ideology is.

1739
02:08:10,683 --> 02:08:12,518
Well then, that saves me time.

1740
02:08:13,640 --> 02:08:16,397
For you already know
that I bear hatred

1741
02:08:16,438 --> 02:08:20,609
towards both the Leaf
and my own clan...

1742
02:08:21,443 --> 02:08:22,653
I have terms.

1743
02:08:23,278 --> 02:08:25,656
I will help you exact revenge
upon the Uchiha Clan.

1744
02:08:26,490 --> 02:08:28,659
But you are not to harm
the village itself.

1745
02:08:29,618 --> 02:08:32,913
Nor... Sasuke Uchiha.

1746
02:08:35,675 --> 02:08:40,000
<i>I regret now, not telling you
everything before it had come to this.</i>

1747
02:08:48,972 --> 02:08:50,072
I see...

1748
02:08:50,704 --> 02:08:52,908
So you've aligned with the other side?

1749
02:08:54,476 --> 02:08:56,795
Father, Mother...

1750
02:08:58,154 --> 02:08:58,738
I...

1751
02:08:58,856 --> 02:09:00,858
I know, Itachi.

1752
02:09:01,649 --> 02:09:04,252
Itachi, just promise me this.

1753
02:09:07,060 --> 02:09:08,728
Take care of Sasuke.

1754
02:09:15,164 --> 02:09:16,415
I will.

1755
02:09:18,514 --> 02:09:19,765
Do not fear.

1756
02:09:20,419 --> 02:09:22,463
This is the path you have chosen.

1757
02:09:23,584 --> 02:09:27,463
Compared to you,
our pain will be over in an instant.

1758
02:09:28,427 --> 02:09:32,473
Even if our philosophies differ,
I am proud of you.

1759
02:09:35,580 --> 02:09:38,291
You are truly a kind child.

1760
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:48,593
There's nothing more to say.

1761
02:09:52,284 --> 02:09:57,488
I have told you the whole truth.
I won't have to ever again...

1762
02:09:59,708 --> 02:10:04,463
I always lied to you and
asked you to forgive me.

1763
02:10:04,630 --> 02:10:07,716
Deliberately keeping you at
a distance.

1764
02:10:09,510 --> 02:10:11,970
All because I didn't want you
to get caught up in any of this.

1765
02:10:13,013 --> 02:10:15,140
But now, I believe...

1766
02:10:15,557 --> 02:10:18,519
that perhaps you could
have changed

1767
02:10:18,560 --> 02:10:22,689
Father, Mother,
and the rest of the Uchiha.

1768
02:10:24,066 --> 02:10:27,069
If I had treated you as an equal
from the start...

1769
02:10:27,110 --> 02:10:30,489
and looked you in the eye
to share the truth,

1770
02:10:31,615 --> 02:10:33,784
then I wouldn't have
to stand before you now...

1771
02:10:33,826 --> 02:10:36,578
from above, as a failure,
trying to reach you.

1772
02:10:37,850 --> 02:10:42,730
So this time, I want to convey
this truth to you...

1773
02:10:48,760 --> 02:10:51,763
You don't ever have to forgive me.

1774
02:10:52,970 --> 02:10:55,889
And no matter what becomes of you
from here on out, know this...

1775
02:10:59,434 --> 02:11:01,967
I will always love you.
