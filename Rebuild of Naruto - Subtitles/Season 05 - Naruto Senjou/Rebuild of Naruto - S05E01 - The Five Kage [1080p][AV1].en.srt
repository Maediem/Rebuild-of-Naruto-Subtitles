1
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:11,594
<i>Iruka.</i>

2
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:13,179
<i>Yes, Lord Hokage?</i>

3
00:00:15,532 --> 00:00:21,396
<i>The Fourth Hokage wanted the
villagers to regard Naruto as a hero.</i>

4
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:25,734
<i>He placed the seal
and died hoping for that.</i>

5
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:52,177
<i>Third Hokage... Fourth Hokage...</i>

6
00:00:57,182 --> 00:01:01,352
<i>There is a hero
right before our eyes.</i>

7
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:32,509
<i>I never imagined
that Pain would be defeated.</i>

8
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:36,346
<i>We must notify Tobi. Let's go.</i>

9
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,051
All right. No one's around.

10
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:23,184
<i>For something I came up with
in the spur of the moment,</i>

11
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,727
<i>that was a good plan!</i>

12
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,564
<i>What do you mean "good plan"?</i>

13
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,900
<i>You sacrificed one of my tentacles.</i>

14
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,570
Now, now, don't get mad, Eight-o.

15
00:02:33,764 --> 00:02:37,560
Ya know they'll regrow,
and ya know I was right-o.

16
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:41,627
<i>Will you stop that annoying rapping
when you're in my presence?</i>

17
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:42,996
<i>You suck!</i>

18
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,417
I know, I know.

19
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,796
Since I'm the one who owns ya,
I know best of all, ha!

20
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,842
That's why this time...

21
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,888
<i>What? Don't start saying
weird stuff again.</i>

22
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:08,062
It will be enka!

23
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,527
Anyway, now I can finally
escape Brother's bossy ways

24
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,362
and get away from the village.

25
00:03:16,622 --> 00:03:17,623
I'm free!

26
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:21,993
As far as he knows,
the Akatsuki's captured me.

27
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:25,330
<i>Raikage is probably on a rampage now.</i>

28
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,831
<i>Are you sure about this?</i>

29
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,293
I've been imprisoned in
the village as a weapon

30
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,754
all because I'm a Jinchuriki.

31
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,965
I need to get out for
some fresh air once in a while, right?

32
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,760
<i>So? What are you going to do?</i>

33
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,430
When it comes to enka,
Kin-sensei is the man!

34
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:43,640
<i>Who is that?</i>

35
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:44,766
Huh?

36
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,685
Don't be lame and remember the name, fool!

37
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,104
He's the King of the enka ninja.

38
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,192
<i>How can you be so carefree?
The Akatsuki won't sit still for long.</i>

39
00:03:54,861 --> 00:03:57,238
<i>Not only that, since you summoned me,</i>

40
00:03:57,263 --> 00:03:59,056
<i>you don't have much stamina left.</i>

41
00:04:00,806 --> 00:04:05,352
<i>Did you really have to call on me
when you had the advantage?</i>

42
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,456
<i>Among all the guys
I've faced in battle,</i>

43
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:12,669
<i>that Sharingan has to rank
in the top two in strength.</i>

44
00:04:13,029 --> 00:04:15,386
<i>I got carried away.</i>

45
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,968
<i>Times may be changing soon.</i>

46
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,012
Huh? Through my enka?

47
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:37,193
I heard, Konohamaru.
You took down one of the Pains!

48
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,155
I wasn't determined to catch up
to you just for fun, you know!

49
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:46,202
But that was nothing compared to
how you saved the entire village.

50
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,121
That's not true.

51
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:51,958
Besides, there were
many things I couldn't protect.

52
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,168
Big Bro Naruto...

53
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:58,381
There's something
I want to show you!

54
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,841
Hey!

55
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:01,843
Where are you going?

56
00:05:01,908 --> 00:05:03,993
Just follow me!

57
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,473
Here!

58
00:05:08,363 --> 00:05:10,157
Why'd you bring me to
the evacuation shelter?

59
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,562
We're going just up further!

60
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,361
The valuables warehouse?

61
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,530
And...
this is my family's storage space.

62
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,661
Ta-dah!

63
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,250
This...

64
00:05:34,506 --> 00:05:35,883
... it's my jacket...

65
00:05:37,221 --> 00:05:39,098
It's a precious treasure.

66
00:05:39,435 --> 00:05:41,687
So I brought it here just in case.

67
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,385
I kept my promise!

68
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:49,011
Konohamaru... You're a great kid!

69
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,698
I know!

70
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:55,271
One day, I'm going to challenge you
for the Hokage's seat!

71
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:59,150
So, from now on,
consider me your rival!

72
00:05:59,246 --> 00:06:00,247
All right!

73
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,411
<i>And that's the whole story.</i>

74
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,039
I never expected Pain to be defeated.

75
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,541
This is unexpected.

76
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,544
Konan isn't coming back here anymore.

77
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:22,298
What should we do?
We have so many vacant positions.

78
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:26,552
We need another pawn who can
synchronize with the Gedo Statue.

79
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,139
Kisame...

80
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,141
You go look for the Eight-Tails.

81
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,851
What about you?

82
00:06:34,536 --> 00:06:36,705
I have slightly different
business to attend to.

83
00:06:49,565 --> 00:06:52,693
This is... I wasn't expecting this.

84
00:06:53,894 --> 00:06:55,395
You're late.

85
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,792
Did Naruto do it?

86
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:00,775
No, it was Pain's doing.

87
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,130
Pain?!

88
00:07:02,564 --> 00:07:06,735
But Naruto handled it.
He defeated Pain.

89
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,470
Naruto did that?!
What about the Nine-Tails?

90
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,181
He was able to control it on his own.

91
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,393
I see...

92
00:07:16,315 --> 00:07:18,817
What? Naruto controlled
the Nine-Tails on his own?!

93
00:07:19,788 --> 00:07:22,040
There's no time to be surprised.

94
00:07:22,299 --> 00:07:24,676
Rebuilding the village
is going to be hard work.

95
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,739
Yamato, we're going to need your help.

96
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:29,852
Okay!

97
00:07:32,457 --> 00:07:33,458
What is it?

98
00:07:33,483 --> 00:07:35,068
An emergency council has been called.

99
00:07:35,762 --> 00:07:36,722
As Jonin squad leader,

100
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:39,625
your presence is also required
at the Feudal Lord's palace, Lord Shikaku.

101
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,088
Already? All right.

102
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,145
What'll I do?

103
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,688
Huh?!

104
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:06,527
Well, the Hidden Leaf Village
has tons of pretty women.

105
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:10,114
And what if all those women
declared their love for me?

106
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:12,945
I was wondering what I'd do.

107
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,578
Oh yes, I see.

108
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,122
Well, why don't you
go out with them?

109
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,874
With as many as you can
get your hands on!

110
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,753
But... when the time comes
to leave the Hidden Leaf

111
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:29,592
and they say they can't bear
to part with me, what'll I do?

112
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,929
I'd be so scared if they suggest
something like a lover's suicide.

113
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:39,727
So are you happy or scared?
What are you trying to say?!

114
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,604
We haven't even reached
the Hidden Leaf Village yet.

115
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,481
Don't get so carried away!
It's creepy!

116
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:47,151
But maybe some handsome guy
with a super-good looking face

117
00:08:47,176 --> 00:08:48,804
might come on to you too.

118
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:50,333
Why can't you just
say handsome guy?

119
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:56,786
Although a rich, tall, famous ninja
in addition to being super-handsome

120
00:08:56,811 --> 00:08:59,064
wouldn't be farfetched.

121
00:08:59,347 --> 00:09:01,140
No, you're letting
your imagination run wild.

122
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,417
No way that would happen!
Absolutely no way!

123
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,505
I didn't ask...

124
00:09:09,051 --> 00:09:10,928
for your opinion!

125
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:21,894
What would we do if that stone
hits a boulder and it crumbles

126
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:25,391
and the falling rocks hit
another bigger boulder

127
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:28,961
that causes an even bigger rock slide
that falls over

128
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,195
the Hidden Leaf Village
and destroys it?

129
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,240
Who's over-imagining things now?!
Idiot!

130
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:39,021
She used Lady Katsuyu's jutsu
to protect everyone.

131
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:43,332
She's been unconscious ever since.

132
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:48,462
We honestly don't know when
she'll regain consciousness.

133
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:51,757
Granny...

134
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,059
Regarding the Akatsuki,

135
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:06,355
we intend to continue pursuing them
with assistance from our allied nations.

136
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,692
With everything that's happened
to your village,

137
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:14,780
we of the Land of Fire shall also provide
full support in rebuilding the village.

138
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,491
First, we need to put together a budget.

139
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,535
Then, we need to ease tensions
between other nations.

140
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,661
More importantly...

141
00:10:22,368 --> 00:10:24,161
There's something
we must attend to first.

142
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:27,810
The selection of a new Hokage.

143
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:31,141
<i>I knew it would come to this.</i>

144
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:36,052
Don't you think we should just
wait until Tsunade recovers?

145
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:41,296
Lord... Tsunade remains in
a comatose state.

146
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:48,648
The village is in ruins, and we don't know
when Tsunade will awaken.

147
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:52,486
We're having a difficult time deciding
what line of action to take.

148
00:10:54,652 --> 00:10:58,489
Besides, she is responsible for bringing about
the destruction of the Leaf Village!

149
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:02,286
I always thought that Jiraiya
would be next.

150
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:06,916
I liked him,
but he's no longer here.

151
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:11,128
So, who else is there?

152
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,922
In that case, I...

153
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,965
I recommend Kakashi Hatake!

154
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:21,639
The son of the White Fang, huh?

155
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,975
Yes! Why not?

156
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,202
What do the rest of you think?

157
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:31,273
Indeed... He's renowned, powerful,
and virtuous.

158
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,360
But perhaps a bit too young?

159
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:38,572
I believe Minato, the Fourth Hokage,
was younger.

160
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,992
Who was Kakashi Hatake's master?

161
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,328
The Fourth Hokage.

162
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:49,542
Is that so? If I'm not mistaken...

163
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,086
Jiraiya was
the Fourth Hokage's master and

164
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,922
the Third Hokage was Jiraiya's master!

165
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,592
There seems to be no problem at all,
is there?

166
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,027
All right! Well then...

167
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:05,182
The Third Hokage's teachings are
practically what annihilated the village!

168
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,937
Akatsuki's leader,
the one who destroyed the village,

169
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,149
was once Jiraiya's student.

170
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,627
This is what happens when
one sympathizes with foreigners

171
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,362
and teaches them ninjutsu!

172
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:22,199
They're naïve! All of them!

173
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:27,514
That naïveté throughout the ages allowed
our ally, the Sand Village, to betray us

174
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:30,959
and allowed Orochimaru to lead
a campaign to destroy the Hidden Leaf.

175
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:36,172
It allowed the rise of the Akatsuki and
allowed Sasuke, a survivor of the Uchiha,

176
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:39,341
to go rogue and work underground!

177
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,470
What sort of Hokage
do we need now?!

178
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,264
Someone who can handle the aftermath
of this terrible situation,

179
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:50,352
and change the ninja world
by enforcing ninja laws.

180
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:56,984
I will become a Hokage
like no other!

181
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:05,075
Lord... Why don't we allow Danzo to
handle this for the time being?

182
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:13,083
A rigid and one-sided way
of doing things is not-

183
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,127
Yes, I've made up my mind.

184
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:16,962
Danzo...

185
00:13:17,885 --> 00:13:21,305
I appoint you as Sixth Hokage!

186
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,686
Hey, over here.

187
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,188
Don't you think we can still
use this timber?

188
00:14:58,433 --> 00:14:59,393
I think you're right.

189
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,400
But...

190
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:06,572
There's nothing left of what was built
by generations of Hokage.

191
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,675
Who could have imagined
this would happen?

192
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,621
This village isn't the only thing
the Hokage left us.

193
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,164
You're absolutely right.

194
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:17,666
Yamato...

195
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,002
We're all still here!

196
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:23,047
<i>Wood Style: Row Houses jutsu!</i>

197
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,974
At this rate, the Leaf Village
will be rebuilt in no time!

198
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,481
Easy for you to say.

199
00:15:44,493 --> 00:15:47,455
Is Granny Tsunade still in a coma?

200
00:15:48,463 --> 00:15:49,104
Yes.

201
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:54,643
I have so many things
I want to tell her.

202
00:15:55,275 --> 00:15:58,987
Don't worry.
Lady Tsunade will wake up soon!

203
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,378
She's a strong woman.
Our Hokage!

204
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,921
She'll be all right!

205
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:07,049
<i>What am I encouraging Naruto for?</i>

206
00:16:07,344 --> 00:16:10,431
<i>I'm the one
who needs convincing... Naruto.</i>

207
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,183
It's been a super-long time,
Naruto! Sakura!

208
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:20,020
It's great to see our hero again, Naruto!

209
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,064
Is that...?

210
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,693
Inari and Old Man Tazuna?!

211
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,323
Inari, you've grown up!

212
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,450
Old man, you've gotten even older.

213
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,827
Shut it...

214
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,537
I'm a carpenter now.

215
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:40,541
That's why I've come here,
at the request of the Hidden Leaf.

216
00:16:40,886 --> 00:16:44,180
And I thought I'd say hello
to you guys.

217
00:16:44,658 --> 00:16:46,826
Sakura, you're so pretty.

218
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,799
You think so?

219
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,343
Man, how long has it been?

220
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,846
Two years? Three? Longer?

221
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,474
Imagine, that little kid is now...

222
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,938
Akane and the others too.

223
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,648
They're carpenters like me.

224
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,317
See? They're working over there.

225
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,448
What a surprise.

226
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,826
Back then, and that time with Gato.

227
00:17:15,851 --> 00:17:17,561
Thank you for everything.

228
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:22,166
Because of you, the Land of Waves
has become very prosperous.

229
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,961
So this time,
we're going to return the favor!

230
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:31,341
First, for you... it'll be Ichiraku!
Just you watch...

231
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,343
I'll build an amazing one!

232
00:17:34,536 --> 00:17:35,537
Inari...

233
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,058
Thanks.

234
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,978
Huh? You're already here?

235
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,271
Kakashi!

236
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,106
Oh, Kakashi!

237
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:49,902
We rushed over after hearing
the Hidden Leaf Village was in a crisis!

238
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,196
I see.

239
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:53,756
Huh?

240
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:55,949
What is it?

241
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,813
Where is Sasuke?

242
00:17:57,838 --> 00:18:00,132
I want to talk to him too.

243
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:01,503
Oh...

244
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,503
Well, actually...

245
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,838
Sasuke is... you see...

246
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:16,428
Sasuke and I had a small fight and
he's out of the village right now.

247
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,348
Don't worry,
I'll go bring him back right away!

248
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,892
When I do, please say hello to him.

249
00:18:22,088 --> 00:18:24,466
I know Sasuke would be happy.

250
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:25,938
Right, Sakura?

251
00:18:25,963 --> 00:18:27,465
U-Uh-huh.

252
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:31,401
Don't tell me...
It's over some love triangle, eh?

253
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:35,697
No, that's not it!

254
00:18:35,971 --> 00:18:37,765
<i>Thank you, Naruto.</i>

255
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,458
<i>Sasuke... Where are you right now?</i>

256
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,551
<i>You have no siblings, or parents!</i>

257
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,511
<i>How can you understand
anything about me?!</i>

258
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,180
<i>You've been alone from the start!</i>

259
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,142
<i>What can you understand
about me?!</i>

260
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,811
<i>Having a bond is what
makes it painful!</i>

261
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:10,482
<i>And how could you know what it feels
like to lose that bond?!</i>

262
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,698
I thought I knew Sasuke.

263
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,826
But I didn't understand him at all.

264
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:25,664
No matter what I said to him back
in the Valley of the End,

265
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,291
it wouldn't have reached Sasuke.

266
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,625
Naruto...

267
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:32,504
I didn't know Sasuke's pain,
so how could I laugh with him?

268
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,133
Why should he give me the time
of day, let alone fight with me?

269
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,847
It'll probably hurt like hell,

270
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,558
but next time, I want to have
a serious fight with him.

271
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:45,909
Because some day,

272
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:50,147
I want Team 7 to laugh together again,
with Sasuke back where he belongs!

273
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,367
N-No way...

274
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:06,997
It can't be! I didn't mean to do this!
I mean, how could a rock that size...

275
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:09,757
K-Karui, what have you done?

276
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,085
There's no way.

277
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,338
Anyway, let's look for someone.

278
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,590
Who are you three?!

279
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,718
I'm Samui from the Hidden Cloud.

280
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:23,138
I am a messenger for the Raikage,
the leader of the Hidden Cloud.

281
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,474
Lord Raikage?

282
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,147
Please pardon our run-in earlier.

283
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,608
We're all on edge lately.

284
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,861
There weren't any guards
from the Leaf around

285
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,696
and finding the village
in such a state...

286
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,782
We were shocked and
wondered what had happened.

287
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,983
- It was the work of the Akatsuki
- Here's your stone.

288
00:20:44,008 --> 00:20:46,005
- that destroyed the village.
- Precautionary measures...

289
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,829
Are being taken immediately
and security will be tightened.

290
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,164
- We would like an audience
- That's got nothing to do with it!

291
00:20:49,189 --> 00:20:50,649
With your Hokage.

292
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,878
I am here to deliver a letter
from the Raikage to Lady Hokage.

293
00:20:55,868 --> 00:20:57,244
Actually...

294
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,508
Is something the matter?

295
00:21:00,782 --> 00:21:02,618
Oww!

296
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,930
Don't tell me
this lump on my head...

297
00:21:04,955 --> 00:21:05,956
Enough!

298
00:21:09,792 --> 00:21:12,795
Talk about bad timing.

299
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:17,124
A sealed tube never
contains any good news.

300
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:20,153
It's a letter calling for an emergency
Five Kage Summit Conference.

301
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,488
You see?

302
00:21:21,752 --> 00:21:23,187
A Five Kage Summit Conference?!

303
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,659
Lady Hokage is in a coma?

304
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:30,122
I am her aide, so I will accept
the letter on her behalf.

305
00:21:33,963 --> 00:21:36,549
If it's uncertain when
she will regain consciousness,

306
00:21:36,836 --> 00:21:38,713
the interim Hokage will do.

307
00:21:38,765 --> 00:21:41,601
Someone must read the letter
and give me a reply!

308
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,760
The Raikage cannot wait.

309
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:45,597
But...

310
00:21:50,486 --> 00:21:53,072
That woman is
no longer the Hokage.

311
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:58,025
I am the new Sixth Hokage.

312
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,652
I will look at the letter.

313
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,323
<i>Don't tell me that Danzo has...</i>

314
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,782
What is it?

315
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,785
Doesn't Lord Raikage
want a reply?

316
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:29,765
Sasuke...
So it has come to this.

317
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,019
And your reply?

318
00:22:39,164 --> 00:22:40,832
Ow! Hey!

319
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,656
What's wrong, Kiba?

320
00:22:46,938 --> 00:22:48,982
Now stay calm and listen!

321
00:22:49,904 --> 00:22:52,073
Lady Tsunade has been
removed as Hokage!

322
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,358
- What?!
- Huh?

323
00:22:54,459 --> 00:22:56,962
It seems someone named Danzo
is the Sixth Hokage!

324
00:22:57,597 --> 00:22:58,905
I don't know too much,

325
00:22:59,131 --> 00:23:00,653
but apparently he's been
active behind the scenes!

326
00:23:00,717 --> 00:23:01,718
Danzo?!

327
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,940
<i>I have a bad feeling about this.</i>

328
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,842
And that's not
the only shocking thing!

329
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:09,096
The Sixth Hokage declared
Sasuke as a rogue ninja,

330
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,873
and has given the order
to dispose of him!

331
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,642
What the hell's going on?!

332
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,936
Even I don't understand.

333
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:18,939
They couldn't wait until
Lady Tsunade recovered.

334
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,500
It makes sense in a way.

335
00:23:21,353 --> 00:23:22,520
Kakashi-sensei...

336
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:25,070
Sasuke is indeed a rogue ninja.

337
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,656
Normally, he would have
been eliminated long ago.

338
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:31,451
It's only because of Lady Tsunade
that he's been allowed to live.

339
00:23:32,898 --> 00:23:34,983
I'm going to see this Danzo!

340
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:36,456
Wait, Sakura!

341
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,687
Storming into his office
will solve nothing.

342
00:23:39,712 --> 00:23:42,506
Lady Tsunade isn't even conscious yet!
How could they do this to her?!

343
00:23:42,568 --> 00:23:44,236
And what about Sasuke?

344
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,800
You can't expect me
to keep quiet!

345
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,844
I'm coming with you.

346
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,720
Calm down, you two.

347
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:55,117
At a time like this, staying calm
is crucial or things won't work out.

348
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,269
How can I stay calm?!

349
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,354
I won't let them lay
a hand on Sasuke!

350
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,148
I said wait!

351
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:04,995
Danzo has already figured out
that this is how you'll react.

352
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,070
So you'll go see him, then what?

353
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,864
I won't do anything violent!

354
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:12,617
I just want to talk to him and ask him
to change his mind about Sasuke!

355
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:17,956
I hardly think that he'll go along with
whatever you have to say...

356
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,625
Danzo has been appointed
by the Feudal Lord.

357
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,752
While he has yet to win
a vote of confidence from the Jonin,

358
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,087
he is the Hokage.

359
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:27,674
If you make a wrong move,
you'll be thrown into jail.

360
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,176
That's fine with me!

361
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:30,677
I'm going!

362
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,429
Me too!

363
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,764
H-Hey guys...

364
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,851
Naruto, you possess
the Nine-Tails.

365
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:40,688
What about it?

366
00:24:41,143 --> 00:24:45,410
Danzo would like nothing better
than to confine you in this village.

367
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,236
Do you want to
be locked up in jail?

368
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,655
That's exactly what he wants.

369
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:54,576
Then you won't be
able to look for Sasuke.

370
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,245
Don't make a scene right now.

371
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,084
You wanted to see me?

372
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,253
Keep an eye on Naruto.

373
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,277
If you notice anything amiss,
inform me immediately.

374
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,426
Yes sir.

375
00:25:14,245 --> 00:25:18,120
Umm... May I ask you a question?

376
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:20,143
What is it?

377
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:24,272
What do you plan
to do with Naruto?

378
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:26,609
Do not worry.

379
00:25:26,846 --> 00:25:29,182
Naruto is the village hero
right now.

380
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,072
Everyone trusts him.

381
00:25:32,819 --> 00:25:36,197
Even more than they trust me,
the Sixth Hokage.

382
00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:39,380
If I do anything to Naruto now,

383
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,979
it will affect my reputation
as the Hokage.

384
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:45,796
This is a crucial time,
right before the vote of confidence.

385
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,297
Still, Naruto is a Jinchuriki.

386
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:53,952
As the Hokage, I must keep
the Jinchuriki under surveillance.

387
00:25:55,293 --> 00:25:58,087
I cannot be lax like Tsunade was.

388
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:01,685
I understand.

389
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,731
You're excused.

390
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,991
<i>Should I be relieved?</i>

391
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:17,647
Sai!

392
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,537
We were just looking for you!

393
00:26:20,793 --> 00:26:22,331
We need to talk to you.

394
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:23,965
What is it?

395
00:26:26,728 --> 00:26:29,356
Tell us what you
know about Danzo.

396
00:26:32,264 --> 00:26:33,086
Sai!

397
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:34,759
That's impossible.

398
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,052
Why?!

399
00:26:36,335 --> 00:26:38,891
Don't tell me you're
working for him again!

400
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,057
No... It's nothing like that.

401
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:45,687
It's not possible for me to
say a word about Lord Danzo.

402
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,231
Due to this.

403
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,655
What the hell is that?

404
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,655
Is it a Curse Mark?

405
00:26:57,862 --> 00:27:01,699
Yes, it's a Curse Mark
placed by Lord Danzo.

406
00:27:02,261 --> 00:27:04,764
If I start to talk about Lord Danzo,

407
00:27:05,015 --> 00:27:09,598
my entire body will become numb
and I won't be able to move or talk.

408
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:13,256
This is true of all who
belong to the Foundation.

409
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,467
He's a cautious man.

410
00:27:16,151 --> 00:27:18,695
Lord Danzo and the Foundation
engage in espionage.

411
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:22,532
They've done a lot of dirty work behind
the scenes in order to protect the village.

412
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,064
This cannot be revealed.

413
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:33,610
So even if one is captured,
not a word will be uttered.

414
00:27:33,963 --> 00:27:35,590
But what a thing to do...

415
00:27:36,096 --> 00:27:38,565
Putting a Curse Mark on
one's own subordinate?

416
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,842
I can't accept that.

417
00:27:40,518 --> 00:27:43,880
It's what has protected Hidden
Leaf Village from the bottom up.

418
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,831
Their methods may have
been unscrupulous,

419
00:27:47,093 --> 00:27:49,868
but their love for the village
is no different from yours.

420
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,780
Then why did he overturn
Lady Tsunade's decision about Sasuke?

421
00:27:55,209 --> 00:27:58,421
Isn't he planning to dispatch
tracking ninja to go after Sasuke?

422
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:00,080
I-Is that so?

423
00:28:00,476 --> 00:28:02,511
I haven't heard anything
regarding Sasuke-

424
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:06,685
You can tell us all about
this Sasuke fellow!

425
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,319
You seem to be his friends!

426
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:17,713
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu</i>

427
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:18,905
Don't kill him!

428
00:28:19,005 --> 00:28:20,006
I know that!

429
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:27,872
Sakura!

430
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,420
Are you all right, Sakura?

431
00:28:34,043 --> 00:28:37,213
Judging from their headbands,
they're ninja from the Hidden Cloud.

432
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,217
<i>Why would they come here?</i>

433
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,637
What the hell do you guys want?

434
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,807
You were just
talking about Sasuke!

435
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,435
Tell us what you were saying!

436
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,938
It's got nothing to do
with you Cloud ninja!

437
00:28:52,212 --> 00:28:53,505
It's got everything to do with us!

438
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:57,492
Sasuke Uchiha of the Hidden Leaf
attacked our village!

439
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:03,199
Your rogue ninja kidnapped our master!

440
00:29:03,758 --> 00:29:06,177
We don't even know if our master
is dead or alive, you idiots!

441
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:08,997
Th-That's a lie!

442
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,708
Why would Sasuke
do such a thing?!

443
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,377
Like we'd know what
the Akatsuki's motives are!

444
00:29:15,576 --> 00:29:17,995
The Akatsuki?!
What do you mean?

445
00:29:18,115 --> 00:29:20,159
Huh?! Don't kid around!

446
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,827
Sasuke is a member
of the Akatsuki!

447
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,514
You guys let your
rogue ninja roam free,

448
00:29:26,716 --> 00:29:28,885
so Lord Raikage ordered us
to come here.

449
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:32,353
And we've gotten your Hokage's
permission to get rid of the Uchiha!

450
00:29:33,615 --> 00:29:36,910
<i>Sasuke...
abducted their master?</i>

451
00:29:38,554 --> 00:29:39,972
We'll get our revenge!

452
00:29:40,226 --> 00:29:42,144
The Uchiha is ours!

453
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:44,831
<i>Sasuke...</i>

454
00:29:49,542 --> 00:29:52,962
<i>What... happened to you?</i>

455
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:00,361
Hey, Sasuke.

456
00:30:05,127 --> 00:30:07,338
<i>I suddenly sensed his chakra.</i>

457
00:30:08,118 --> 00:30:09,178
<i>What's going on?</i>

458
00:30:09,412 --> 00:30:11,914
Aw man... Bad timing.

459
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,613
How did you know where to find me?

460
00:30:15,207 --> 00:30:16,792
Don't underestimate me.

461
00:30:17,116 --> 00:30:19,577
I have considerable powers.

462
00:30:19,962 --> 00:30:21,755
So what do you want with me now?

463
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:26,911
Taka left the Akatsuki.
We're done with you.

464
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,496
As it stands, you reneged
on your promise to me.

465
00:30:31,784 --> 00:30:33,202
What are you talking about?

466
00:30:33,454 --> 00:30:35,248
I'm talking about hunting
the Tailed Beast.

467
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,170
We already captured the Eight-Tails
and delivered him to you.

468
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,464
That was just a substitution.

469
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:44,172
In other words, you guys failed.

470
00:30:45,617 --> 00:30:48,579
The Eight-Tails pulled
a fast one on you.

471
00:30:50,032 --> 00:30:51,909
<i>I saw it all with my Sharingan.</i>

472
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:54,620
<i>There's no way he had
an opportunity to make a clone.</i>

473
00:30:58,347 --> 00:31:00,725
<i>The only part of his body
that I cut off!</i>

474
00:31:01,294 --> 00:31:04,756
Frankly,
I'm disappointed in you all.

475
00:31:05,004 --> 00:31:07,173
So what are you going to do?

476
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,492
It's none of our business now.

477
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:10,691
Wrong.

478
00:31:10,716 --> 00:31:13,970
You will finish whatever work you started
as members of the Akatsuki.

479
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:17,333
Having said that,
you can forget about the Eight-Tails.

480
00:31:17,695 --> 00:31:20,614
I've decided to give you
a different task.

481
00:31:21,042 --> 00:31:23,461
And if I refuse?

482
00:31:24,536 --> 00:31:26,872
We'll fight it out right here.

483
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:30,054
And you won't be able to
go to Hidden Leaf Village.

484
00:31:30,586 --> 00:31:31,712
We'll force our way through!

485
00:31:36,873 --> 00:31:39,834
It's a little too late to
go to the Hidden Leaf.

486
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,902
<i>I went right through him.</i>

487
00:31:44,114 --> 00:31:46,575
<i>Just like before.
Is this his power?</i>

488
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:51,879
Your purpose is fruitless.
Too bad.

489
00:31:51,929 --> 00:31:53,222
What do you mean?

490
00:31:54,739 --> 00:31:57,909
The Village Hidden in
the Leaves is no more.

491
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,210
What are you saying?!

492
00:32:03,633 --> 00:32:07,303
<i>I'll explain it to you.</i>

493
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:09,302
Who is he?!

494
00:32:09,655 --> 00:32:12,408
Relax. He's my partner.

495
00:32:13,338 --> 00:32:15,757
So, who is the new Hokage?

496
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,311
Someone named Danzo.

497
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,980
It's pretty much
what we expected.

498
00:32:21,329 --> 00:32:24,081
Danzo... is the Hokage?

499
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,378
Yes, one of the high-ranking elders
of the Hidden Leaf

500
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:29,656
who drove your elder brother
into a corner.

501
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:33,242
He is the new Hokage.

502
00:32:33,464 --> 00:32:36,050
What the hell happened in
the Hidden Leaf Village.!

503
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:39,540
My subordinate, Pain,
destroyed the Hidden Leaf.

504
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,961
And because both you and Pain
were a bit too reckless,

505
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:45,588
it seems the Five Kage
are going to take action.

506
00:32:46,787 --> 00:32:48,122
The Five Kage?

507
00:32:48,874 --> 00:32:50,876
There will be
a Five Kage Summit Conference.

508
00:32:51,372 --> 00:32:53,958
I'll explain from here.

509
00:32:55,582 --> 00:32:58,669
You will tell us everything
you know about Sasuke.

510
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,230
Of course,
his ninjutsu style and powers,

511
00:33:02,446 --> 00:33:05,032
but also any data
you have gathered about

512
00:33:05,178 --> 00:33:09,485
the Akatsuki and Sasuke's partners,
as well as their past actions.

513
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,346
No way! It's a lie!

514
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,783
Sasuke wouldn't join
the Akatsuki!

515
00:33:14,028 --> 00:33:15,863
Are you sure about this?

516
00:33:16,164 --> 00:33:18,458
Yes! The Uchiha family crest
was verified!

517
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:20,915
And his facial composite
matched the list.

518
00:33:21,136 --> 00:33:25,012
That's... That's not poss...

519
00:33:28,843 --> 00:33:32,096
Why are you crying?!
We're the ones who want to cry!

520
00:33:32,697 --> 00:33:35,992
Your tears won't bring back
Lord Killer Bee or Lady Yugito!

521
00:33:36,397 --> 00:33:39,484
If you have time to cry,
then start talking about Sasuke!

522
00:33:40,698 --> 00:33:42,145
Wait, guys.

523
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:43,479
Huh?!

524
00:33:43,726 --> 00:33:47,229
When the authorization to
terminate Sasuke was given,

525
00:33:47,596 --> 00:33:51,487
all Hidden Leaf data relating to him
should have been passed on to you.

526
00:33:52,193 --> 00:33:54,820
It's not necessary to
press these two any further.

527
00:33:55,429 --> 00:33:57,014
Oh, you're right!

528
00:33:57,288 --> 00:34:00,458
Our captain is now waiting for it.

529
00:34:00,483 --> 00:34:05,864
We were just trying to get whatever
other information was available!

530
00:34:05,889 --> 00:34:07,432
You can't expect us to stay still!

531
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:11,114
We don't even know
how our master's doing!

532
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,638
<i>I will avenge Pervy Sage!</i>

533
00:34:18,084 --> 00:34:20,587
<i>I can't just sit around
doing nothing!</i>

534
00:34:24,098 --> 00:34:28,102
You're not involved in this,
so you wouldn't understand how we feel!

535
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:31,819
Is your master a Jinchuriki?

536
00:34:32,893 --> 00:34:33,936
How did you know?

537
00:34:34,326 --> 00:34:36,203
I'm a Jinchuriki too.

538
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,618
The Akatsuki is after the Jinchuriki.

539
00:34:39,032 --> 00:34:41,118
So actually, I am involved.

540
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,707
The Akatsuki will always
capture a Jinchuriki alive.

541
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:48,169
That means your master
may not be dead.

542
00:34:49,437 --> 00:34:50,438
Are you serious?!

543
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:54,175
Never mind Sasuke.
You need to save your master first.

544
00:34:54,833 --> 00:34:56,084
Are you really sure about this?!

545
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:57,506
Really, really sure?

546
00:34:57,609 --> 00:34:59,069
Didn't I tell you?!

547
00:34:59,283 --> 00:35:01,828
Our master wouldn't die so easily!

548
00:35:02,103 --> 00:35:04,147
I'll help you rescue your master,

549
00:35:04,172 --> 00:35:07,759
and I'll give you whatever information
we have on the Akatsuki.

550
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:11,109
Hey blondie,
you're quick to understand!

551
00:35:12,084 --> 00:35:15,713
Come with us and
tell us about Sasuke!

552
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:17,983
Naruto...

553
00:35:19,487 --> 00:35:22,490
Leave it to me, Sakura.

554
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:25,374
What's your name?

555
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:26,916
Naruto?

556
00:35:27,129 --> 00:35:30,048
This Naruto guy defeated Pain
all by himself?

557
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,132
That's right.
He's become extremely strong.

558
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,802
I think he's stronger
than Sasuke right now.

559
00:35:39,724 --> 00:35:41,267
I don't care about that.

560
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,641
My main concern is
this Five Kage Summit.

561
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,309
What are we going to do?

562
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,228
The Leaf Village is no more.

563
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:51,566
And if this Danzo, our target, is going
to the Five Kage Summit,

564
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:53,317
shouldn't we be heading there too?

565
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,071
Wh-What? Am I wrong?

566
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:01,742
We, Taka, will take the Hokage's head
at the Five Kage Summit.

567
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,828
We're changing our destination.

568
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,414
Sounds like a plan.

569
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:11,002
So, where is this Five Kage Summit
taking place?

570
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:15,131
<i>This is becoming a really
bothersome situation.</i>

571
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:16,966
Zetsu!

572
00:36:17,055 --> 00:36:19,391
My clone will guide you.

573
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,606
Okay, follow me!

574
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,533
Can we trust them?

575
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,702
We'll wait and see for now.

576
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,455
If I sense anything suspicious,

577
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,040
I'll get rid of them with
my Amaterasu.

578
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:52,251
There's something I've been
meaning to test out anyway.

579
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,714
<i>All is going as planned.</i>

580
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:57,965
Not everything.

581
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:01,994
Nagato's Gedo Art of Rinne Rebirth
was supposed to be used for my benefit.

582
00:37:02,132 --> 00:37:04,884
I never expected he would use it
for something other than that.

583
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,016
To betray me...

584
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:11,312
Even if Sasuke should become
stronger than Nagato,

585
00:37:11,471 --> 00:37:13,765
it is meaningless if
he cannot be controlled.

586
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:18,110
It will be awhile before I consider letting
him synchronize with the Gedo Statue.

587
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,737
We need to keep an eye on him.

588
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:25,368
<i>So you had contingent plans
in case Nagato died?</i>

589
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:26,869
Somewhat.

590
00:37:27,417 --> 00:37:30,712
However, it's certainly not
what I had in mind.

591
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,709
Naruto Uzumaki...

592
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,088
He managed to put
a small dent in my plan.

593
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:40,591
<i>What next then?
Make our move?</i>

594
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:44,345
We're done moving ahead cautiously.

595
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,807
Let us push forward
on "Project Tsuki no Me."

596
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,810
You're late, Kankuro!

597
00:37:50,965 --> 00:37:53,551
Assembling my new puppets
took longer than I expected!

598
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,774
Lord Kazekage, have a safe journey.

599
00:37:57,333 --> 00:38:00,211
Lord Kankuro, Lady Temari...
We're counting on you.

600
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:01,946
We know.

601
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:05,366
But Gaara doesn't really
need bodyguards.

602
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,576
We're off.

603
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,113
Kurotsuchi, Akatsuchi,
we're counting on you two!

604
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,380
Lord Tsuchikage!

605
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:22,466
Show the other Kage
what you're made of!

606
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:26,862
Traveling to a summits
at my age is quite a chore.

607
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:30,725
Look at those young ones
romping around.

608
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,352
They don't even know what it's
like to have chronic back pain.

609
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:36,230
Then maybe it's time to retire, Gramps.

610
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,691
Why drag out the glory?

611
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:44,196
Let me carry that pack for you,
Lord Tsuchikage!

612
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,700
Hands off, Akatsuchi!

613
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,493
I don't need your help!

614
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:03,966
My back!

615
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:07,803
Well? Want to send
someone else for you?

616
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,472
Y-You idiot!

617
00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:11,662
Who do you think I am?!

618
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:13,184
I am the Tsuchikage,

619
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,686
once feared as Ohnoki of Both Scales
of the Hidden Stone!

620
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,981
Enough!
I shall carry my own packs!

621
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:22,693
Seriously... What a stubborn old geezer!

622
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:34,246
Here, you can carry
your own pack if you wish.

623
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,166
Now let's go!

624
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,671
Of all the...
Do as you please!

625
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,716
Just admit that's better, Gramps.

626
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:49,553
Have a safe journey, Lord Tsuchikage!

627
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,603
Guard Lady Mizukage well.

628
00:39:58,121 --> 00:40:00,290
Make sure Lady Mizukage
doesn't overdo things.

629
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:01,732
I know.

630
00:40:08,485 --> 00:40:09,778
Thank you.

631
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:11,659
Great Elder...

632
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:15,871
I swear upon my title of Mizukage
to carry out my duties flawlessly.

633
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,876
Chojuro, you are one of
the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist.

634
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,754
Protect our Mizukage well.

635
00:40:24,271 --> 00:40:25,773
Y-Yes sir.

636
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:29,343
We should be fine...
I think.

637
00:40:29,937 --> 00:40:31,855
Have more confidence in yourself.

638
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,305
You are strong.

639
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:37,393
That is why I chose you to
accompany me to the summit.

640
00:40:38,108 --> 00:40:39,568
Okay, Chojuro?

641
00:40:39,976 --> 00:40:41,352
Yes, ma'am.

642
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,733
I can handle it... I think.

643
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,903
<i>She's so kind.</i>

644
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,780
"Yes, ma'am" would be enough!

645
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:52,241
Such an uncertain attitude
will get you nowhere!

646
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:56,162
I swear, young people these days lack
the dedication to manage themselves.

647
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:58,664
<i>Marriage?</i>

648
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:01,709
Ao! Enough with the lecturing!

649
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,003
Get going or you'll be late!

650
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,797
<i>Late... for marriage?!</i>

651
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:11,260
It's my way of offering advice!
Why, in my day...

652
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:13,888
Shut up, or I'll kill you.

653
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:15,890
Huh?!

654
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,435
All right, Chojuro, Ao...

655
00:41:19,715 --> 00:41:20,716
Let us go!

656
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:25,983
<i>I will do everything to protect that
smile on our gentle Lady Mizukage!</i>

657
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,320
<i>I hope I can.</i>

658
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:33,782
What are you doing, Ao?

659
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:35,701
Lady Mizukage has left.

660
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:38,662
Oh, no!

661
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:41,207
Lady Mizukage, please wait for me!

662
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:51,133
Still no word from Team Samui?!

663
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:56,096
No, sir. But I do expect to
hear something soon.

664
00:41:57,139 --> 00:42:02,269
And Samui has already been given the route
you will take to the summit, Lord Raikage.

665
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:06,982
She will either rendezvous with
you directly, or send a messenger bird.

666
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:10,236
Good! Then I shall be off as well!

667
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,911
Let us go! Shee! Darui!

668
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:19,828
Yes, sir!

669
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:21,330
Right.

670
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:22,873
Follow me!

671
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,461
Not again!

672
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:29,672
Let's go, Darui.

673
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:33,342
No... I'll just use the door.

674
00:42:34,339 --> 00:42:35,882
Go on, I'll catch up.

675
00:42:38,206 --> 00:42:39,499
This should do.

676
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:44,228
All right, let's hear about Sasuke.

677
00:42:54,269 --> 00:42:56,271
Well? Start talking!

678
00:43:01,325 --> 00:43:02,997
I can't do it.

679
00:43:03,922 --> 00:43:05,966
I can't sell Sasuke out.

680
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,711
Quit playing around!

681
00:43:08,949 --> 00:43:11,077
You can't take it back now,
after all that's been done.

682
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:18,804
<i>Still, Sasuke is also a ninja
from the Hidden Leaf Village.</i>

683
00:43:19,284 --> 00:43:20,368
<i>He is a comrade!</i>

684
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:24,351
<i>We would risk our lives to save him.
That's the Hidden Leaf way.</i>

685
00:43:24,961 --> 00:43:30,300
<i>Naruto... This is a once in
a lifetime request.</i>

686
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,559
<i>Please...
Please bring Sasuke back.</i>

687
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:41,742
Well?! Say something!

688
00:43:43,503 --> 00:43:45,505
I know I'm being selfish.

689
00:43:46,266 --> 00:43:48,227
But I can't sell out Sasuke.

690
00:43:48,462 --> 00:43:49,505
Why you...

691
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:53,631
I understand your desire
for revenge.

692
00:43:53,847 --> 00:43:57,434
But if you let your hatred rule
and you kill Sasuke,

693
00:43:57,722 --> 00:44:00,891
this time, my comrades
may not put up with it!

694
00:44:01,237 --> 00:44:02,656
Eye for an eye!

695
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,826
The vicious cycle will start
all over again!

696
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:09,538
The people we want to protect
will kill each other off one after another!

697
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:13,233
Your Sasuke is the one
who started it all!

698
00:44:13,377 --> 00:44:14,670
I don't give a damn what you say!

699
00:44:14,695 --> 00:44:16,363
We're going to kill Sasuke!

700
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:21,659
Then where do you suggest
we take our hatred?

701
00:44:22,022 --> 00:44:23,940
How would you take responsibility
for that?

702
00:44:29,269 --> 00:44:32,730
Beat me up until you're satisfied.

703
00:44:33,226 --> 00:44:35,032
That's about all I can offer...

704
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:41,470
You sure know how to spit
convenient words, don't you?!

705
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,014
Let's test your theory.

706
00:44:44,468 --> 00:44:46,659
See if it would really make me
feel better, huh?!

707
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,852
How's that?! And that! And that!

708
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:50,312
Take that!

709
00:45:01,306 --> 00:45:04,976
I have Anko being followed by
Dajimu and Tera, both skilled men.

710
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:08,080
Perhaps now is the time
to dispose of her.

711
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:10,502
This is a crucial time.

712
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:14,420
I want to avoid any mishaps
that could worsen the situation.

713
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:20,175
Increase our troops.
Get Kabuto before Anko does.

714
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:26,598
<i>That man might know about
my connection to Orochimaru.</i>

715
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:31,478
Kabuto has the research data
from Orochimaru's human experiments.

716
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,648
We must get that data without fail.

717
00:45:37,928 --> 00:45:42,016
I'm certain it will be useful for
my right eye and left arm.

718
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,867
Fu and Torune,
you two stay here.

719
00:45:45,118 --> 00:45:47,537
Terai, I'll rely on you to
deal with Kabuto.

720
00:45:47,562 --> 00:45:48,146
Now go!

721
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,246
Yes sir!

722
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:55,252
Now, I must leave for
the Five Kage Summit Conference.

723
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:58,236
Except in special cases,

724
00:45:58,261 --> 00:46:00,472
we are only permitted to bring
a maximum of two retainers to the summit.

725
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,859
You are the top two in the Foundation.

726
00:46:03,884 --> 00:46:06,637
I have decided that
you shall accompany me.

727
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:10,100
Masks are forbidden.
Remove them.

728
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,608
What level of arms are
we allowed for your protection?

729
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,611
Do not concern yourself
with any limitations.

730
00:46:21,244 --> 00:46:23,079
I'll leave it to your judgment, Fu.

731
00:46:23,104 --> 00:46:23,730
Yes sir.

732
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:24,782
Torune...

733
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:27,743
Make sure your subordinates
watch Naruto.

734
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:31,872
I doubt that Sai would do
anything to betray the Foundation.

735
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,415
But it's a precaution.

736
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:34,625
Yes sir.

737
00:46:35,686 --> 00:46:40,024
They are to make certain that the
Nine-Tails does not leave the village.

738
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,561
Let me make this clear!

739
00:46:55,044 --> 00:46:57,755
No amount of pummeling is going
to make me feel better!

740
00:46:58,109 --> 00:47:01,951
I won't stop until you start
talking about Sasuke!

741
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,162
Don't interfere.

742
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:15,123
He asked for this.

743
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:20,741
Sai... Stay out of this.

744
00:47:22,516 --> 00:47:23,517
Naruto...

745
00:47:23,729 --> 00:47:27,191
You don't have to get beaten up
for Sasuke's sake.

746
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:30,764
Shut up. It's my choice.

747
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:35,102
Sasuke... keeps hurting you
over and over again.

748
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:37,104
If I were you...

749
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:40,566
If you get in the way,
we'll beat you up too.

750
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,819
Enough already, Karui.

751
00:47:44,662 --> 00:47:47,957
Beating them up won't
get us anywhere.

752
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,409
You should know that.

753
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:59,418
He promised to help us
rescue Lord Killer Bee.

754
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:04,923
What?! Where's your usual skepticism
about promises being honored?

755
00:48:05,052 --> 00:48:07,137
This isn't like you at all!

756
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:09,761
Naruto...

757
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:14,850
No matter what we do,
he refuses to sell out his friend.

758
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:17,519
He may be a foe,
but I like guys like him.

759
00:48:18,494 --> 00:48:20,996
A man shouldn't be loose with words.

760
00:48:21,931 --> 00:48:24,976
However much you thrash him,
he won't betray Sasuke.

761
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,243
He's the type who means
what he says.

762
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,158
Captain Samui.

763
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,576
Omoi, Karui.

764
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,038
How goes the intel-gathering?

765
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:41,543
I hope you haven't gotten into trouble.

766
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:44,379
Never mind that.

767
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:47,299
We've learned that
Lord Killer Bee may be alive!

768
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:48,508
Let's go and save him!

769
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,303
First, we have to find
the Akatsuki hideout!

770
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:52,971
And then what?

771
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,572
Just the three of us against a foe

772
00:48:55,597 --> 00:48:57,284
who managed to capture
Lord Killer Bee himself?

773
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:00,542
Besides, we don't even know
how many hideouts the Akatsuki have.

774
00:49:00,567 --> 00:49:01,676
Where do we start?

775
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:05,609
We need to gather intel,
and then analyze it.

776
00:49:05,834 --> 00:49:07,252
That comes first!

777
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,780
We cannot repeat what happened
back then with Yugito.

778
00:49:10,498 --> 00:49:14,127
We'll take the intel we've gathered
directly to Lord Raikage!

779
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,328
There is too much information
to sort out.

780
00:49:17,377 --> 00:49:20,714
T-Take me with you.

781
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:25,712
I want to help you guys save
your Jinchuriki.

782
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:26,847
Naruto!

783
00:49:26,917 --> 00:49:31,797
And I... have something I want to discuss
with the Raikage.

784
00:49:32,086 --> 00:49:35,104
Lord Raikage?
You've got to be kidding!

785
00:49:35,129 --> 00:49:35,952
Karui...

786
00:49:37,654 --> 00:49:38,988
<i>So this child is Naruto.</i>

787
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:44,272
<i>Naruto Uzumaki... the one everyone
in this village is talking about.</i>

788
00:49:45,206 --> 00:49:46,917
We don't know enough about you.

789
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:49,277
And with Lord Raikage on the road
under minimal guard,

790
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:52,105
there's no way I can have you meet him.

791
00:49:55,894 --> 00:49:57,563
Karui, Omoi. Let's get going!

792
00:49:57,956 --> 00:50:00,751
We have permission to inspect the intel
on Sasuke and the Akatsuki.

793
00:50:01,058 --> 00:50:04,854
It'll take time to transfer the notes
and I need your help.

794
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:08,742
Sai...

795
00:50:09,024 --> 00:50:10,025
What is it?

796
00:50:10,119 --> 00:50:14,457
Take me to Kakashi-sensei
and Captain Yamato.

797
00:50:14,779 --> 00:50:15,947
Okay. Here...

798
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:22,225
You should let Sakura take
a look at that.

799
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:23,376
No, it's okay.

800
00:50:24,032 --> 00:50:28,202
If she sees me like this,
it'll just cause more trouble.

801
00:50:28,737 --> 00:50:32,074
Besides, I heal fast.

802
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:35,423
Sai...

803
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:39,036
What you did earlier... Thanks.

804
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:42,481
No problem.

805
00:50:42,921 --> 00:50:45,090
Boy, they really worked you over.

806
00:50:46,402 --> 00:50:47,486
Oww!

807
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:48,670
Oh, I'm sorry.

808
00:50:48,733 --> 00:50:51,485
You'd better take some time
to recuperate.

809
00:50:51,718 --> 00:50:53,971
I'm going to see the Raikage!

810
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,178
What are you saying?!

811
00:50:56,663 --> 00:50:58,332
The Five Kage Summit is
about to convene!

812
00:50:58,887 --> 00:51:00,657
It is agreed that every Hidden Village
will exercise restraint

813
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:02,934
in leaving their lands and
conducting radical missions!

814
00:51:03,331 --> 00:51:04,624
What will you do by seeing him?

815
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:08,607
I'm going to convince him
to forgive Sasuke!

816
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:12,152
Right now, you don't even have
the necklace that seals the Tailed Beast!

817
00:51:12,578 --> 00:51:15,665
A Jinchuriki like you must not
leave the village!

818
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:20,964
It was bad enough that as many as eight
tails transformed during that last battle!

819
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:24,780
We were lucky that the Seal activated
in time to suppress the Nine-Tails,

820
00:51:24,805 --> 00:51:26,603
but who knows
about the next time?

821
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:29,595
Besides, I'm in charge of
the village reconstruction.

822
00:51:30,124 --> 00:51:32,293
I cannot stay by you all the time!

823
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:35,884
I met the Fourth Hokage.

824
00:51:38,916 --> 00:51:41,252
That last time,
it was the Fourth Hokage

825
00:51:41,641 --> 00:51:43,351
who stopped
my Nine-Tails transformation.

826
00:51:43,426 --> 00:51:45,219
Wh-What does he mean?

827
00:51:45,608 --> 00:51:47,277
The Fourth Hokage
passed away a long...

828
00:51:47,432 --> 00:51:50,977
There are still many mysteries to
the Sealing Jutsu, the Reaper Death Seal.

829
00:51:51,332 --> 00:51:55,544
He probably sealed his own
mental energy into the sealing spell.

830
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:59,219
That's when the Fourth Hokage
told me...

831
00:51:59,949 --> 00:52:02,076
A guy wearing the Akatsuki mask

832
00:52:02,155 --> 00:52:04,616
orchestrated the Nine-Tails incident
16 years ago.

833
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:09,584
And he was so strong, even the Fourth
Hokage was almost no match for him!

834
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:12,337
On top of that, he said this guy
was the mastermind

835
00:52:12,978 --> 00:52:15,475
that was probably using Pain.

836
00:52:16,579 --> 00:52:22,251
If Sasuke has joined the Akatsuki,
then he's also being used.

837
00:52:23,483 --> 00:52:26,152
This is just what Lord Jiraiya feared.

838
00:52:28,101 --> 00:52:29,644
That incident 16 years ago...

839
00:52:30,533 --> 00:52:33,036
To think he was behind it.

840
00:52:35,742 --> 00:52:37,703
He possessed the Sharingan.

841
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:42,576
He belonged to the Uchiha clan and
left the village harboring great hatred.

842
00:52:42,601 --> 00:52:45,896
And only he, Madara, is capable
of summoning the Nine-Tails.

843
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:52,252
Anything is possible if it
involves Madara.

844
00:52:52,972 --> 00:52:54,766
So he's still alive.

845
00:52:55,648 --> 00:52:57,150
<i>Madara...</i>

846
00:52:58,583 --> 00:53:03,546
<i>That vision and chakra more
ominous than mine...</i>

847
00:53:04,429 --> 00:53:08,809
<i>It's just like Madara Uchiha
from long ago.</i>

848
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:11,636
Who's Madara?

849
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:16,304
A man who was defeated
by the First Hokage.

850
00:53:17,147 --> 00:53:19,754
The former leader of the Uchiha Clan
of Hidden Leaf Village.

851
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:23,074
The higher-ups must be informed of this.

852
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:23,641
Sai!

853
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:24,444
Yes?

854
00:53:24,923 --> 00:53:27,301
Report this to the Hokage.

855
00:53:27,514 --> 00:53:28,681
R-Right.

856
00:53:29,597 --> 00:53:32,767
Naruto. What did the Fourth Hokage
say to you?

857
00:53:34,361 --> 00:53:37,864
Fathers like to tell their sons
all sorts of things, right?

858
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:58,777
He said... he believed in me!

859
00:54:00,011 --> 00:54:01,012
Good!

860
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:03,615
Naruto, you will go to the Raikage!

861
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:04,658
Huh?

862
00:54:04,757 --> 00:54:07,414
With Yamato and I as your escorts.

863
00:54:07,439 --> 00:54:08,440
What?!

864
00:54:08,882 --> 00:54:11,083
This is a bad idea!

865
00:54:11,108 --> 00:54:15,215
What? Can't listen to what
I have to say, Tenzo?

866
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:18,373
Hey! You're not supposed to call me
by that name, remember?!

867
00:54:18,398 --> 00:54:19,732
Now, now...

868
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:28,139
Lord Danzo...

869
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:29,474
I know.

870
00:54:31,275 --> 00:54:32,944
I haven't seen combat in a long time.

871
00:54:33,233 --> 00:54:36,027
This is the perfect opportunity
to loosen my muscles.

872
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:39,067
Do not interfere.

873
00:54:39,755 --> 00:54:41,131
I will handle them!

874
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:51,037
It hurts.

875
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:58,837
It hurts.

876
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:09,139
<i>Seven, eight, nine, ten...</i>

877
00:55:10,936 --> 00:55:12,354
<i>Seventeen total, eh?</i>

878
00:55:18,776 --> 00:55:20,778
Okay! I'm ready!

879
00:55:23,975 --> 00:55:27,812
Please don't mention Naruto's actions
when you report to the Hokage.

880
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,285
Tell him there's been no movement.

881
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:35,540
It seems you still do not trust me.

882
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:39,252
You work under Danzo and
your job is to keep an eye on Naruto.

883
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:46,843
However, you are also
a member of my Team 7.

884
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:50,055
So I do believe in you.

885
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:56,353
<i>He said... he believed in me!</i>

886
00:55:57,918 --> 00:56:00,421
<i>What is this feeling?</i>

887
00:56:01,303 --> 00:56:02,304
Catch you later!

888
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:20,279
These are remnants of the Hannya
Black Ops from the Land of Woods

889
00:56:20,304 --> 00:56:21,992
that we annihilated in the past.

890
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:24,172
It's always been like this.

891
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:26,800
Enemies looking for
the slightest opportunity to strike.

892
00:56:27,937 --> 00:56:29,772
Now that you've
come out of the shadows,

893
00:56:29,797 --> 00:56:31,799
things may become more
troublesome for you, sir.

894
00:56:32,351 --> 00:56:34,520
A ninja lives in an ascetic world.

895
00:56:34,895 --> 00:56:37,147
To remain anonymous was
a source of pride.

896
00:56:38,038 --> 00:56:40,124
But by exclusively controlling both
the surface and the underground,

897
00:56:40,149 --> 00:56:42,485
one can truly strengthen village
and nation.

898
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:45,819
I will make certain that
this summit is a success

899
00:56:45,973 --> 00:56:48,309
and that I am recognized
as the Hokage.

900
00:56:48,748 --> 00:56:52,585
Then the Jonin Council will have no choice
but to accept me as their Hokage.

901
00:56:55,797 --> 00:56:58,444
My era has finally come.

902
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,923
Finished at last!

903
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:08,216
Seriously...

904
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:11,428
Try to maintain your cool more if you
want to call yourselves ninja, got it?!

905
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:13,763
We must hurry to Lord Raikage!

906
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,515
- Gotcha!
- Right!

907
00:57:25,199 --> 00:57:27,827
<i>Sorry, but I'm planting
Signal Seeds on you.</i>

908
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:30,697
<i>I may not look it,
but tailing is my specialty.</i>

909
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:35,702
<i>Now then...</i>

910
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:38,663
<i>I should contact Kakashi
and Naruto.</i>

911
00:57:41,413 --> 00:57:43,957
I wonder if that Naruto kid is okay.

912
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:48,556
If you say another word,
I'll beat you up!

913
00:57:48,581 --> 00:57:50,250
It's been bugging you too, eh?

914
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:55,263
I told you not to talk!

915
00:57:55,756 --> 00:57:58,925
Man... Your hands move
as quick as ever.

916
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:04,589
Begin tailing.

917
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,018
Right!

918
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:16,117
Chojuro...

919
00:58:16,571 --> 00:58:19,490
Your Great Twin Sword Hiramekarei
must have been heavy during the journey.

920
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:21,456
Are you all right?

921
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:25,668
Oh... yes.
Although I feel a bit warm.

922
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:27,504
Let me see.

923
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:32,383
Lady Fifth,
you spoil Chojuro too much!

924
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:35,970
This is why youth these days
get so full of themselves!

925
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:38,890
Feeling feverish after
a short walk like that!

926
00:58:39,463 --> 00:58:40,881
In my day...

927
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:42,685
Ao...

928
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:46,596
We're no longer in the dark ages when
we were known as the Blood Mist Village.

929
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:50,443
The nightmare under
the Fourth Mizukage is over.

930
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:53,112
Please stop harping on
about the past.

931
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:55,907
P-Pardon me, I just...

932
00:58:57,408 --> 00:59:01,704
Now, let us stop such depressing talk
and have some supper instead.

933
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:04,707
I am looking forward to
the meal here.

934
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,251
Oops!

935
00:59:06,427 --> 00:59:08,596
What's for dinner?
Something engaging, I hope.

936
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:10,838
<i>Engaging?</i>

937
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:13,800
<i>Engagement!</i>

938
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:17,470
You did make arrangements
for dinner, didn't you, Chojuro?

939
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:24,018
Th-There were so many choices,
in the end, I couldn't decide.

940
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:27,522
<i>In the end, it was...</i>

941
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,274
Such indecisiveness!

942
00:59:30,668 --> 00:59:33,921
Youth these days have no ambition
in their hearts! Only voids!

943
00:59:36,207 --> 00:59:37,249
<i>Void?!</i>

944
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:40,660
I'm so sorry. I'll get on it right away!

945
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:47,083
<i>My engagement...
in the end, it was... void?!</i>

946
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:50,211
Why, back in my day...

947
00:59:52,552 --> 00:59:53,887
Shut up, or I'll kill you.

948
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:56,134
Why?!

949
01:00:07,109 --> 01:00:09,862
Man, it's getting cold.

950
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:13,318
The Land of Iron is just
a stone's throw away.

951
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:16,571
Wait, there's something up ahead.

952
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:22,660
I've never been to the Land of Iron.
I'm so excited.

953
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:25,496
There's nothing special about it.

954
01:00:25,944 --> 01:00:27,695
What's it like, Gramps?

955
01:00:29,038 --> 01:00:32,166
It lies among three mountains known
as the Three Wolves.

956
01:00:32,392 --> 01:00:35,806
It has its own culture,
its own jurisdiction,

957
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:38,231
a powerful military
and maintains neutrality.

958
01:00:40,598 --> 01:00:42,225
So it has its own culture and power.

959
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:44,085
What makes it different from
the Land of Earth?

960
01:00:45,395 --> 01:00:49,691
There is a long-standing rule
that ninja will not meddle with it.

961
01:00:49,754 --> 01:00:51,881
The Land of Iron does not
rely on ninja.

962
01:00:52,783 --> 01:00:56,078
Instead, it is protected by those
who are known as samurai.

963
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:06,496
How did it go?

964
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:10,041
The security is real tight due
to the Five Kage Summit.

965
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:15,129
Jugo, use animals to scout out
the route to the summit

966
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:16,673
where the security is the thinnest.

967
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,341
Okay.

968
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:27,141
We have been awaiting your arrival,
Lord Kazekage.

969
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:31,729
My name is Mifune,
a General of this Land of Iron.

970
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:36,693
It is a pleasure to meet you.
I am the Kazekage, Gaara.

971
01:01:37,498 --> 01:01:38,499
It's cold.

972
01:01:38,962 --> 01:01:41,506
The climate is totally different
from the Land of Wind.

973
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:44,534
Some hot tea will warm you up.

974
01:01:44,986 --> 01:01:45,987
Please come inside.

975
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:54,127
It's gotten cold all of a sudden.

976
01:01:54,168 --> 01:01:56,462
We're in the middle of tailing!
So, shh!

977
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:04,679
How is it?

978
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:07,014
We can go up a route
on the west side.

979
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,891
There aren't many guards.

980
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:12,687
Karin, keep checking
the chakra positions of the guards.

981
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:14,239
We're going to infiltrate now.

982
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:16,023
I have to come too?!

983
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:19,485
This is the time to demonstrate
your powers.

984
01:02:19,944 --> 01:02:21,154
Zetsu, was it?

985
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:22,572
Yeah?

986
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:26,967
I need you to confirm which
one is Danzo. You're coming too.

987
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:38,171
A message from Sai, it seems.

988
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:49,807
What is it?

989
01:02:51,035 --> 01:02:52,828
Just a routine report.

990
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:54,771
Let's go.

991
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:03,362
Why can't we just ambush him
before he arrives?

992
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:04,947
I'm getting tired.

993
01:03:04,972 --> 01:03:06,057
Are you stupid?!

994
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:10,703
If the Hokage is late, they're bound to
think something went wrong.

995
01:03:11,202 --> 01:03:13,704
Then samurai reinforcements
will swarm all over the place.

996
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:16,042
And what if the other Kage come too?

997
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,628
We don't know the enemy's strength.

998
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,589
So we should wait for our chance
for a surprise attack on his way home.

999
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:23,382
Right, Sasuke?

1000
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:29,055
Karin, just focus on
the enemy's chakra positions.

1001
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:32,058
Busted.

1002
01:03:32,109 --> 01:03:33,110
Shut up!

1003
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:36,145
Sasuke, it seems you have
your hands full.

1004
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:37,522
Never mind that.

1005
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:39,941
I need you to verify which one
is Danzo before the meeting.

1006
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:41,400
You better not lie.

1007
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:44,070
I am attuned to chakra.

1008
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:47,448
There's always a disturbance
in chakra when one lies.

1009
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:51,144
So just remember,
I'll be checking on you all the time.

1010
01:03:52,578 --> 01:03:54,413
I won't lie.

1011
01:03:54,833 --> 01:03:57,919
Danzo is a hindrance to us too.

1012
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:05,466
Lord Raikage, it's Team Samui.

1013
01:04:06,226 --> 01:04:07,227
Let's descend!

1014
01:04:09,491 --> 01:04:11,952
I have returned from
the Hidden Leaf Village.

1015
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:13,474
And how did it go?

1016
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:17,603
Samui, you've been tailed.

1017
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:20,439
Come out, you Hidden Leaf dogs!

1018
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:33,872
You actually tailed Samui.
You guys are pretty good.

1019
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:35,454
Y-You...

1020
01:04:35,561 --> 01:04:36,868
You're Naruto!

1021
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:39,709
You tailed us! What's the big idea?!

1022
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:45,506
Boss, the one on the right...
is Kakashi Hatake.

1023
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:47,592
I know that!

1024
01:04:48,724 --> 01:04:51,685
Did the Hokage send you,
Kakashi Hatake?

1025
01:04:52,346 --> 01:04:55,349
No, I came to ask you personally

1026
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:58,978
about a request by Naruto Uzumaki
of the Hidden Leaf.

1027
01:04:59,937 --> 01:05:01,564
Naruto Uzumaki?

1028
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:04,775
If you could hear him out
for just a while.

1029
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:09,405
Isn't this a bit rude?

1030
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:13,159
Stopping us en route to the summit
without any prior notice.

1031
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:15,745
I am fully aware of that.

1032
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:18,164
No matter.

1033
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:21,751
You there, boy! Speak!

1034
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:26,714
Sasuke...

1035
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:30,343
I want you to revoke the order
to eliminate of Sasuke Uchiha!

1036
01:05:32,386 --> 01:05:35,097
H-Hey, this isn't really the place...

1037
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:36,766
Are you still talking about that?!

1038
01:05:36,807 --> 01:05:37,808
You sure got guts.

1039
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:39,393
What are you saying?

1040
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:42,146
I know it sounds ridiculous!

1041
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:45,274
But this is the only way
I know how to say it!

1042
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:48,027
Sasuke is my friend!

1043
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:52,114
My friend's going to get killed. I
can't just stand by and let it happen!

1044
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:55,076
On top of that,
I don't want Sasuke to be

1045
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:57,495
the cause of the Leaf and
Cloud Villages killing each other.

1046
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:02,041
I don't want my friends,
or the Cloud to fight for revenge!

1047
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:28,150
I'm begging you!

1048
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:31,487
I don't want us killing each other
out of vengeance anymore!

1049
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:40,788
All Sasuke ever thought
about was revenge!

1050
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:45,209
He became obsessed with it
and that changed him.

1051
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:50,923
Vengeance makes you go mad.

1052
01:06:52,603 --> 01:06:54,730
It turns you into someone
you don't recognize anymore.

1053
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:59,932
I don't want anyone else
to become like Sasuke!

1054
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:04,103
I don't want the Leaf and Cloud Villages
to destroy each other!

1055
01:07:06,407 --> 01:07:07,408
That's why...

1056
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:22,705
We will eliminate Sasuke!

1057
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:25,499
After that, you can stop the cycle.

1058
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:28,294
What a fool.

1059
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:31,797
We are in a hurry.
We've let you have your say.

1060
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:33,549
Lord Raikage...

1061
01:07:34,967 --> 01:07:38,220
The incident in which you tried
to obtain the Hyuga Byakugan

1062
01:07:38,375 --> 01:07:40,419
is still unresolved on our side.

1063
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:45,042
The Hidden Leaf swallowed
tears of blood and

1064
01:07:45,067 --> 01:07:47,903
avoided fighting the Cloud,
who fueled the fires of war.

1065
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,818
It's thanks to those noble sacrifices
that your people still exist.

1066
01:07:53,257 --> 01:07:54,884
Please try not to forget that.

1067
01:07:56,697 --> 01:07:58,991
Right here and now,
this young ninja,

1068
01:07:58,991 --> 01:08:02,706
no matter how awkwardly,
is bowing his head in his concern

1069
01:08:02,731 --> 01:08:04,649
for the Cloud and Leaf,
village and nation.

1070
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:06,916
Lord Raikage...

1071
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:13,005
As one of the Five Kage,
what do you think of this?

1072
01:08:17,722 --> 01:08:20,307
A ninja does not bow
his head so easily!

1073
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:23,641
A ninja values action and strength!

1074
01:08:24,391 --> 01:08:27,103
Concessions are forbidden
in agreements made between ninja.

1075
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:31,023
The history of man is a history of war.

1076
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:33,567
Since the three Great Ninja Wars

1077
01:08:33,592 --> 01:08:38,013
every nation, and every land
has tried to obtain powerful ninjutsu.

1078
01:08:38,257 --> 01:08:40,259
Those without power are crushed.

1079
01:08:41,175 --> 01:08:43,052
That is the truth of the ninja world.

1080
01:08:44,578 --> 01:08:46,997
The Akatsuki will be branded
as wanted fugitives.

1081
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:51,127
Then, not only I, but the whole
world will hunt Sasuke down.

1082
01:08:52,517 --> 01:08:57,007
Yet you bow your head for this criminal
and plead for mercy for your friend.

1083
01:08:57,633 --> 01:09:00,261
In the ninja world,
that is not friendship!

1084
01:09:02,179 --> 01:09:06,475
Boy from the Hidden Leaf,
think hard on what you must do!

1085
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:10,020
The ninja world does not indulge fools!

1086
01:09:12,189 --> 01:09:13,315
Let's go!

1087
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:25,119
Naruto...

1088
01:09:25,977 --> 01:09:26,978
Enough already.

1089
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:28,706
Raise your head.

1090
01:10:12,663 --> 01:10:13,956
We have been waiting for you.

1091
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:19,131
He's the one.
The old one in the middle.

1092
01:10:22,699 --> 01:10:25,493
So that's... Danzo!

1093
01:10:33,242 --> 01:10:35,036
Please remove your Kage hats.

1094
01:10:42,863 --> 01:10:45,491
In response to Lord Raikage's request,

1095
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:48,160
the five Kage have assembled here.

1096
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:57,044
I am Mifune, your moderator.

1097
01:10:58,128 --> 01:11:01,090
The Five Kage Summit Conference
is called into order.

1098
01:11:01,632 --> 01:11:03,717
I shall speak first. Hear me.

1099
01:11:04,361 --> 01:11:08,031
There's such a difference
in Kage these days.

1100
01:11:08,657 --> 01:11:14,216
To be a Kage at your age is quite
an accomplishment, Lord Kazekage.

1101
01:11:14,882 --> 01:11:18,219
It seems your father trained you
extremely well,

1102
01:11:18,572 --> 01:11:21,324
except in the area of proper etiquette.

1103
01:11:24,029 --> 01:11:25,197
You're probably right.

1104
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:28,284
It is the reason why
I can be here as Kazekage.

1105
01:11:30,244 --> 01:11:32,204
You certainly are cocky.

1106
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:35,582
Lord Tsuchikage,
there's no need to make fun of him.

1107
01:11:36,629 --> 01:11:38,464
Continue, Lord Kazekage.

1108
01:11:39,169 --> 01:11:41,130
I am a former Jinchuriki.

1109
01:11:41,913 --> 01:11:43,665
I was captured by the Akatsuki,

1110
01:11:43,816 --> 01:11:45,859
- they took my Tailed Beast
-The nerve of that Tsuchikage!

1111
01:11:45,884 --> 01:11:47,094
- And nearly killed me.
- Quiet!

1112
01:11:47,386 --> 01:11:52,182
So I consider the Akatsuki
extremely dangerous.

1113
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:57,796
I sought the cooperation of the five
Kage many times, but was ignored.

1114
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:00,107
Except by the previous Hokage.

1115
01:12:00,891 --> 01:12:05,437
At a time when various lands
have had their Jinchuriki stolen

1116
01:12:05,792 --> 01:12:08,045
the response by this group
has been far too slow!

1117
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:12,036
How can the Hidden Villages of
the Five Great Nations serve

1118
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:15,247
as an example when they allow
their Jinchuriki to be taken?

1119
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:16,790
It is an embarrassment!

1120
01:12:17,748 --> 01:12:20,209
It is common sense to resolve this
in utmost secrecy.

1121
01:12:21,086 --> 01:12:25,132
Seeking the help of other lands
just because of that is nonsense!

1122
01:12:26,258 --> 01:12:28,844
Saving face... Prestige...

1123
01:12:29,474 --> 01:12:31,392
Such old-fashioned beliefs.

1124
01:12:32,701 --> 01:12:33,827
<i>Such a brat.</i>

1125
01:12:34,965 --> 01:12:37,467
Old-fashioned beliefs aside...

1126
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:41,815
I will acknowledge that as the
Mizukage, I have delayed action.

1127
01:12:42,549 --> 01:12:48,097
However, having our Tailed Beast
stolen is no cause for immediate fear.

1128
01:12:49,095 --> 01:12:54,100
Controlling a Tailed Beast requires
skill, knowledge and time.

1129
01:12:55,032 --> 01:12:59,792
The Jinchuriki and the Tailed Beast must
mature together and adapt to each other.

1130
01:13:00,282 --> 01:13:02,701
And still, controlling
the Tailed Beast is difficult.

1131
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:04,713
It is not a simple task.

1132
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:07,341
Isn't that so, Lord Kazekage?

1133
01:13:08,258 --> 01:13:11,345
The only ones who were capable
of controlling a Tailed Beast were

1134
01:13:11,807 --> 01:13:14,810
Madara Uchiha and
the First Hokage, Hashirama Senju.

1135
01:13:15,287 --> 01:13:17,906
Also, Fourth Mizukage Yagura,

1136
01:13:18,231 --> 01:13:22,110
and Lord Raikage's younger brother,
Killer Bee.

1137
01:13:23,008 --> 01:13:24,009
However...

1138
01:13:24,206 --> 01:13:25,586
- Chojuro!
- Right!

1139
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,905
This is a place of discussion.

1140
01:13:47,310 --> 01:13:50,671
Please refrain from disruptive actions.

1141
01:13:51,497 --> 01:13:53,666
Stand down, Fu, Torune.

1142
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:58,876
You too, Kankuro, Temari.

1143
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:02,062
Ao, Chojuro. I'm fine.

1144
01:14:02,384 --> 01:14:03,156
Yes, ma'am.

1145
01:14:19,663 --> 01:14:21,665
Let us continue our discussion.

1146
01:14:22,488 --> 01:14:25,783
The Hidden Leaf, Stone, Sand and Mist...

1147
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:30,507
rogue ninja from your villages
make up the Akatsuki!

1148
01:14:30,969 --> 01:14:32,179
And that is not all!

1149
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:36,239
From our investigations,
we know that among you,

1150
01:14:36,264 --> 01:14:39,875
including your previous Kage,
there are those who used the Akatsuki!

1151
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:41,810
Used them?!

1152
01:14:42,128 --> 01:14:44,297
I do not trust you!

1153
01:14:44,853 --> 01:14:47,230
I had no intention of even
discussing this with you.

1154
01:14:48,025 --> 01:14:54,031
But the reason I convened this summit
is to question your loyalty!

1155
01:14:55,210 --> 01:14:57,879
What do you mean, "used" the Akatsuki?

1156
01:14:58,185 --> 01:15:01,438
You are the Kazekage,
yet you have not been informed?

1157
01:15:01,870 --> 01:15:03,622
Ask the elders back home!

1158
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:07,911
You used the Akatsuki in the past war!

1159
01:15:10,485 --> 01:15:13,780
The Great Nations are heading
towards uniform stability.

1160
01:15:14,354 --> 01:15:17,324
They are moving from military expansion
to military disarmament.

1161
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:22,434
As fear and the threat of war
diminishes between nations,

1162
01:15:22,729 --> 01:15:25,845
Hidden Villages, which are
the source of its military strength,

1163
01:15:25,870 --> 01:15:28,748
become costly hindrances.

1164
01:15:29,233 --> 01:15:34,821
And yet, carelessly downsizing
the villages poses a risk.

1165
01:15:35,424 --> 01:15:37,402
What if war suddenly breaks out?

1166
01:15:37,427 --> 01:15:41,472
It would be a problem to depend on
ninja who have no experience in war.

1167
01:15:41,691 --> 01:15:43,860
It would mean certain defeat!

1168
01:15:44,397 --> 01:15:50,089
And one way to reduce that risk is
mercenary soldiers.

1169
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:53,090
Namely, the Akatsuki?

1170
01:15:53,632 --> 01:15:58,804
It takes effort and money to train
skilled ninja from your own village.

1171
01:15:59,156 --> 01:16:01,874
But the Akatsuki,
which makes war its livelihood,

1172
01:16:01,899 --> 01:16:04,193
is made up of experienced professionals.

1173
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:08,105
Furthermore, they can be hired
for cheap.

1174
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:12,901
Best of all,
they return exceptional results.

1175
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:15,737
Get serious, Tsuchikage!

1176
01:16:17,723 --> 01:16:21,853
The Sand used the Akatsuki
to destroy the Hidden Leaf.

1177
01:16:22,953 --> 01:16:24,496
I'm speaking of Orochimaru!

1178
01:16:24,955 --> 01:16:28,584
It is not clear if he had broken away
from the Akatsuki or not.

1179
01:16:29,054 --> 01:16:32,463
But as a result, your father,
the Fourth Kazekage,

1180
01:16:32,488 --> 01:16:35,324
and the Third Hokage Hiruzen, died.

1181
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:39,879
And frankly, it's hard not to
rule out the idea

1182
01:16:39,904 --> 01:16:42,573
that this was someone's scheme.

1183
01:16:44,516 --> 01:16:46,143
<i>The old fox.</i>

1184
01:16:46,977 --> 01:16:50,230
The most suspicious is the Hidden Mist!

1185
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:53,233
You Mist do not conduct diplomacy.

1186
01:16:53,514 --> 01:16:55,808
There are even rumors that
the Akatsuki originated there!

1187
01:16:57,519 --> 01:17:00,188
Since we have come this far
I will speak honestly.

1188
01:17:01,575 --> 01:17:03,577
<i>Is Lady Fifth going to reveal...</i>

1189
01:17:04,536 --> 01:17:06,042
There were suspicions that

1190
01:17:06,067 --> 01:17:12,247
someone was manipulating Yagura,
our Fourth Mizukage.

1191
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:16,465
And there was a possibility that
it was the Akatsuki.

1192
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:21,428
No one wanted this to
get blown out of proportion.

1193
01:17:22,732 --> 01:17:24,484
Each and every one of you...

1194
01:17:24,580 --> 01:17:27,077
Hold your tongue, Raikage!

1195
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:31,688
Ultimately, it is because your village
disregarded the disarmament efforts

1196
01:17:31,965 --> 01:17:35,301
and sought powerful ninjutsu.

1197
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:40,238
We had no choice but to counter
by hiring the Akatsuki!

1198
01:17:40,614 --> 01:17:41,865
What?!

1199
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:45,952
Before we start arguing
about the situation,

1200
01:17:46,107 --> 01:17:49,527
there is a statement
I have been waiting to make.

1201
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:50,666
What is it?

1202
01:17:51,725 --> 01:17:54,394
The leader of the Akatsuki is...

1203
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:57,269
probably Madara Uchiha.

1204
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:02,037
Are you sure of that?

1205
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:07,307
Hasn't he been dead for several decades?

1206
01:18:07,756 --> 01:18:09,048
He is right.

1207
01:18:09,674 --> 01:18:12,385
He died long ago.

1208
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:14,690
I do not know the details.

1209
01:18:15,827 --> 01:18:18,329
But the information is quite reliable.

1210
01:18:19,069 --> 01:18:21,113
Are you saying he is immortal?!

1211
01:18:21,677 --> 01:18:23,137
Perhaps.

1212
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:27,202
To think... that he was really a monster.

1213
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:34,589
I want to speak on behalf
of the neutral nations.

1214
01:18:35,114 --> 01:18:38,993
The leader of the Akatsuki was
able to read the times well.

1215
01:18:39,595 --> 01:18:42,818
Despite stabilization,
nations had private suspicions

1216
01:18:42,843 --> 01:18:47,264
and the Akatsuki took advantage
of that weakness to amass its power.

1217
01:18:48,598 --> 01:18:50,100
What are you trying to say?!

1218
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:51,601
Calm down.

1219
01:18:52,837 --> 01:18:55,214
Turn calamity into good fortune.

1220
01:18:56,064 --> 01:19:00,193
It is extremely rare for all
five Kage to assemble.

1221
01:19:01,476 --> 01:19:02,894
What do you say?

1222
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,771
Until the Akatsuki is eliminated,
why not establish

1223
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:12,122
the world's first Allied Shinobi Forces
of the Five Hidden Villages?

1224
01:19:13,135 --> 01:19:14,720
An allied force?

1225
01:19:15,921 --> 01:19:20,063
That is a fine plan.
We are in an emergency state.

1226
01:19:20,301 --> 01:19:22,428
Cooperation is crucial.

1227
01:19:24,668 --> 01:19:26,378
<i>It's going perfectly.</i>

1228
01:19:26,670 --> 01:19:31,758
Going forward, we must determine
a chain of command.

1229
01:19:32,102 --> 01:19:35,355
We must avoid any further confusion.

1230
01:19:36,046 --> 01:19:41,259
So? Who will we choose to
lead the allied forces?

1231
01:19:42,027 --> 01:19:44,738
Leaving that to you five
will only result in arguments.

1232
01:19:45,181 --> 01:19:49,500
So I ask that you respect
the position of the neutral nations

1233
01:19:49,525 --> 01:19:52,704
and allow me to come up
with a proposal

1234
01:19:52,883 --> 01:19:57,930
to decide who among you
five Kage is most suitable.

1235
01:20:01,087 --> 01:20:03,757
<i>This spells the end of Tsunade's era.</i>

1236
01:20:05,973 --> 01:20:09,738
Presently, only Hidden Leaf Village
has a Jinchuriki, the Nine-Tails.

1237
01:20:10,169 --> 01:20:13,631
The key is how to utilize it.

1238
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:19,894
How about granting
the supreme authority

1239
01:20:19,919 --> 01:20:22,567
of the Allied Shinobi Forces
to the Hokage?

1240
01:20:25,028 --> 01:20:29,574
If you all approve,
I will accept this appointment.

1241
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:41,086
Why the Hokage?!

1242
01:20:42,547 --> 01:20:45,773
He is known as
"The Shinobi of Darkness"!

1243
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:49,427
We cannot let him take charge!

1244
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,223
Then whom would you suggest?

1245
01:20:53,557 --> 01:20:57,644
Not one of the Akatsuki came
from my village!

1246
01:20:57,936 --> 01:21:02,433
This important post requires trust!
I should be the one to...

1247
01:21:02,458 --> 01:21:04,418
I cannot agree to that.

1248
01:21:04,522 --> 01:21:05,940
What?!

1249
01:21:09,948 --> 01:21:15,223
I am well aware that passion
and strength are essential

1250
01:21:15,248 --> 01:21:17,292
in bringing the strong together.

1251
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:19,666
But someone like you,

1252
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:22,127
who lets his emotions rule
his use of power,

1253
01:21:22,441 --> 01:21:26,756
would send the Allied Forces into
disarray, just like that desk.

1254
01:21:29,676 --> 01:21:32,178
I am simply making
an objective, rational observation

1255
01:21:32,178 --> 01:21:35,223
as a representative of
a neutral nation.

1256
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:39,978
Lord Kazekage is much
too young to wield such power.

1257
01:21:40,344 --> 01:21:42,721
He does not yet have
much pull with nations.

1258
01:21:42,772 --> 01:21:45,567
His title of Kazekage alone
is inadequate.

1259
01:21:46,179 --> 01:21:48,998
Lord Tsuchikage, on the other hand,
is too advanced in years

1260
01:21:49,023 --> 01:21:51,275
and gives the impression of
one whose power has waned.

1261
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:55,035
And, he used the Akatsuki too much.

1262
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:57,495
He is the least trustworthy.

1263
01:21:58,185 --> 01:22:03,399
Lady Mizukage's Hidden Mist is said
to be the birthplace of the Akatsuki.

1264
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:06,588
There is the fear that inside information
will be leaked to them.

1265
01:22:06,945 --> 01:22:09,322
That there are spies.

1266
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:13,345
We do not know why the Akatsuki
is gathering the Tailed Beasts

1267
01:22:13,345 --> 01:22:15,263
or what they intend to do with them.

1268
01:22:15,877 --> 01:22:18,713
But we cannot let them
have the Nine-Tails.

1269
01:22:20,435 --> 01:22:22,646
The Nine-Tails belongs
to the Hidden Leaf.

1270
01:22:22,947 --> 01:22:26,284
Hence, I believe that the Hokage
is the logical choice.

1271
01:22:26,524 --> 01:22:30,445
First, I refuse to recognize
an Allied Shinobi Force

1272
01:22:30,726 --> 01:22:33,604
that would compromise
the security of my village!

1273
01:22:35,116 --> 01:22:36,910
<i>Something about this
just doesn't feel right.</i>

1274
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:40,403
<i>I'd better check.</i>

1275
01:22:41,623 --> 01:22:42,624
Chojuro...

1276
01:22:43,541 --> 01:22:44,876
Be prepared for battle.

1277
01:22:45,377 --> 01:22:46,127
Huh?

1278
01:23:20,286 --> 01:23:22,163
Huh? Where'd that guy go?

1279
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:43,601
Ready?

1280
01:23:44,394 --> 01:23:45,395
<i>Yeah.</i>

1281
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:47,814
Then begin.

1282
01:23:50,654 --> 01:23:51,568
<i>Byakugan!</i>

1283
01:23:56,208 --> 01:23:57,627
<i>Th-This is...</i>

1284
01:24:00,952 --> 01:24:02,245
<i>What's the meaning of this?</i>

1285
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:04,748
<i>That right shoulder and right arm...</i>

1286
01:24:06,079 --> 01:24:08,831
<i>and the color of the right eye...</i>

1287
01:24:10,090 --> 01:24:11,257
<i>There's no mistake.</i>

1288
01:24:12,410 --> 01:24:14,079
<i>It's the color of Shisui Uchiha's eye!</i>

1289
01:24:14,478 --> 01:24:16,647
<i>He was a formidable foe
that I fought against once.</i>

1290
01:24:18,370 --> 01:24:20,664
<i>I'll never forget his color!</i>

1291
01:24:25,861 --> 01:24:26,987
Lord Hokage!

1292
01:24:27,714 --> 01:24:30,437
I ask that you show us your right eye
underneath that bandage.

1293
01:24:31,763 --> 01:24:33,098
What's going on?

1294
01:24:34,981 --> 01:24:36,888
I believe you stole
Shisui Uchiha's eye

1295
01:24:36,913 --> 01:24:40,010
and then transplanted it into
your right eye, did you not?

1296
01:24:40,558 --> 01:24:42,894
Shisui... Uchiha?

1297
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:48,669
The man praised alongside
Itachi Uchiha

1298
01:24:48,694 --> 01:24:52,281
as the Uchiha's most gifted in
the use of ocular jutsu?

1299
01:24:52,955 --> 01:24:53,729
Yes.

1300
01:24:54,133 --> 01:24:57,759
Shisui's particular ocular jutsu
allowed him to enter others' minds,

1301
01:24:57,784 --> 01:25:03,373
make them go through phantom
experiences and manipulate them.

1302
01:25:04,585 --> 01:25:07,213
The victim would be totally unaware
that he was being manipulated.

1303
01:25:07,716 --> 01:25:09,509
It was an ocular jutsu of
the highest degree!

1304
01:25:10,632 --> 01:25:13,218
Hokage! Don't tell me Mifune
is being...

1305
01:25:14,087 --> 01:25:17,707
But... that's...

1306
01:25:18,557 --> 01:25:23,268
My right eye is also a precious spoil
of war, from a battle against the Hyuga.

1307
01:25:23,786 --> 01:25:26,706
So like you, I am not really one
to talk.

1308
01:25:27,525 --> 01:25:29,486
But you cannot fool my eye,

1309
01:25:29,511 --> 01:25:33,098
which saw through the genjutsu cast
upon the Fourth Mizukage!

1310
01:25:33,837 --> 01:25:34,838
And...

1311
01:25:35,505 --> 01:25:36,964
Why you!

1312
01:25:40,839 --> 01:25:43,258
Hello!

1313
01:25:56,182 --> 01:25:59,477
Sasuke Uchiha has snuck in!

1314
01:25:59,773 --> 01:26:05,112
Now, where could he be hiding?!

1315
01:26:06,552 --> 01:26:08,304
What?!

1316
01:26:08,766 --> 01:26:09,892
Sasuke?

1317
01:26:09,917 --> 01:26:11,835
- Him?
- What's he doing here?!

1318
01:26:11,978 --> 01:26:13,479
The one with the Sharingan?

1319
01:26:13,785 --> 01:26:15,620
The one who took down
Haku and Zabuza?

1320
01:26:17,937 --> 01:26:18,938
Who's he?

1321
01:26:20,325 --> 01:26:22,243
A member of the Akatsuki.

1322
01:26:23,024 --> 01:26:24,359
I believe his name was...

1323
01:26:24,912 --> 01:26:30,043
Let's all go and look for Sasuke!

1324
01:26:30,131 --> 01:26:31,758
Yeah!

1325
01:26:37,210 --> 01:26:39,170
Where is Sasuke Uchiha?!

1326
01:26:41,041 --> 01:26:42,834
Answer me!

1327
01:26:45,658 --> 01:26:49,412
<i>Th-This guy is super fast!</i>

1328
01:26:51,781 --> 01:26:54,617
If you refuse to answer,
I will show you no mercy!

1329
01:26:55,419 --> 01:26:59,196
You leave me no choice.
I'll give you a hint, so...

1330
01:27:00,329 --> 01:27:01,830
Shee! Begin!

1331
01:27:02,102 --> 01:27:03,103
Yes sir!

1332
01:27:03,906 --> 01:27:05,825
You didn't have to kill him.

1333
01:27:06,311 --> 01:27:10,424
We could have taken him in and tortured him
into revealing intel about the Akatsuki.

1334
01:27:11,888 --> 01:27:16,852
No one in the Akatsuki talks.
They are extremely loyal.

1335
01:27:17,757 --> 01:27:21,552
Okisuke, Urakaku.
Issue an order to search for Sasuke.

1336
01:27:22,033 --> 01:27:24,744
And issue a Number 2
battle-ready state alert.

1337
01:27:24,994 --> 01:27:25,995
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

1338
01:27:27,537 --> 01:27:28,621
Lord Raikage!

1339
01:27:28,748 --> 01:27:29,916
You! The eye-patch from the Mist!

1340
01:27:31,820 --> 01:27:33,530
Watch the Hokage!

1341
01:27:33,882 --> 01:27:35,133
Shee! Darui!

1342
01:27:35,275 --> 01:27:36,526
Come!

1343
01:27:40,778 --> 01:27:42,864
I'm so sorry about the desk
and the wall.

1344
01:27:43,009 --> 01:27:45,303
Darui, never mind that. Let's go!

1345
01:27:47,506 --> 01:27:49,800
What a violent fellow.

1346
01:27:50,577 --> 01:27:54,122
The Cloud's rascal hasn't changed
even as a Kage.

1347
01:27:55,496 --> 01:27:57,206
Number 2 battle-ready state alert.

1348
01:27:57,462 --> 01:27:59,714
Search for the intruder, Sasuke Uchiha.

1349
01:27:59,930 --> 01:28:01,932
Dispatch three squads
to the tower entrance.

1350
01:28:02,008 --> 01:28:03,217
Create a line of defense.

1351
01:28:03,979 --> 01:28:04,480
<i>Roger.</i>

1352
01:28:04,739 --> 01:28:05,740
Move out!

1353
01:28:08,190 --> 01:28:09,191
What's this?!

1354
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:11,138
What is it, Karin?

1355
01:28:11,494 --> 01:28:13,579
The Samurai's movements
have suddenly become flurried.

1356
01:28:14,330 --> 01:28:15,706
I think they're looking for us!

1357
01:28:16,085 --> 01:28:16,919
What?!

1358
01:28:16,944 --> 01:28:20,323
But we didn't do anything to be spotted.

1359
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:22,597
I bet it was Zetsu.

1360
01:28:38,644 --> 01:28:39,895
They're already gone.

1361
01:28:46,777 --> 01:28:47,862
<i>Sasuke...</i>

1362
01:28:53,141 --> 01:28:57,937
<i>Where are you now?
And what are you thinking?</i>

1363
01:28:59,660 --> 01:29:07,866
<i>Do you think about me, Sakura,
or Kakashi-sensei... even a little?</i>

1364
01:29:12,923 --> 01:29:13,924
Hey...

1365
01:29:14,587 --> 01:29:17,382
How about we talk, Naruto Uzumaki?

1366
01:29:18,711 --> 01:29:19,712
You!

1367
01:29:27,153 --> 01:29:28,779
A Rasengan right off the bat, huh?

1368
01:29:32,767 --> 01:29:34,561
You know it doesn't work on me, right?

1369
01:29:46,481 --> 01:29:48,150
Naruto, you just stay put.

1370
01:29:52,173 --> 01:29:54,759
As expected, Sharingan Kakashi.

1371
01:29:55,422 --> 01:29:56,507
You are fast.

1372
01:29:56,579 --> 01:30:01,250
We won't let you get your hands on
Naruto that easily, Madara Uchiha.

1373
01:30:02,236 --> 01:30:04,906
You did just hear my last line,
didn't you?

1374
01:30:05,698 --> 01:30:09,911
No attacks work against
Madara Uchiha.

1375
01:30:10,505 --> 01:30:12,621
I don't know if you are
merely erasing your presence

1376
01:30:12,646 --> 01:30:15,023
or if this is an astral projection,

1377
01:30:15,324 --> 01:30:17,368
but I know it's necessary for you
to manifest physically

1378
01:30:17,393 --> 01:30:18,685
in order to capture Naruto.

1379
01:30:19,662 --> 01:30:21,831
Otherwise, you couldn't actually
grab him.

1380
01:30:22,650 --> 01:30:24,110
We'll aim for that.

1381
01:30:30,787 --> 01:30:32,622
This here is now my territory.

1382
01:30:35,373 --> 01:30:40,670
I never thought it would be easy.
You see, I have my own plan.

1383
01:30:41,535 --> 01:30:44,205
But right now, I'd rather talk.

1384
01:30:44,714 --> 01:30:45,798
Talk?

1385
01:30:46,464 --> 01:30:50,801
Yes. What was it that made Pain, Nagato,
turn into a traitor?

1386
01:30:51,255 --> 01:30:54,258
Naruto... You have aroused my curiosity.

1387
01:30:54,916 --> 01:30:56,667
Who cares about something like that?!

1388
01:30:56,877 --> 01:30:59,004
What do you intend to do
with Sasuke?!

1389
01:30:59,063 --> 01:31:00,731
Tell me about Sasuke!

1390
01:31:02,209 --> 01:31:03,627
Sasuke, huh?

1391
01:31:09,288 --> 01:31:12,082
Very well. I'll tell you.

1392
01:31:14,423 --> 01:31:16,592
About the man whose hatred
of the ninja world

1393
01:31:16,617 --> 01:31:19,536
runs through his bones
to his very core.

1394
01:31:20,867 --> 01:31:22,911
About Sasuke Uchiha.

1395
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:28,289
Sasuke's story cannot be told
without mentioning Itachi.

1396
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:31,550
So first, hear the truth about Itachi.

1397
01:31:37,872 --> 01:31:40,124
It doesn't look like he'll be moving
around again.

1398
01:31:40,458 --> 01:31:41,555
Lord Ao,

1399
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:44,904
please confirm if the Hokage's
Ocular jutsu is still engaged or not.

1400
01:31:45,111 --> 01:31:48,573
No. The flow of chakra in
his chakra network is very calm.

1401
01:31:49,003 --> 01:31:50,087
The jutsu is undone.

1402
01:31:50,870 --> 01:31:55,295
Relax. It's not a jutsu I can use
that many times in a day.

1403
01:31:55,571 --> 01:31:59,950
I'll decide that. For you are a man
who cannot be trusted.

1404
01:32:00,568 --> 01:32:03,571
I never imagined the Byakugan had fallen
into outside hands.

1405
01:32:04,478 --> 01:32:06,772
Had the traitor been a Hyuga
from the Hidden Leaf,

1406
01:32:06,797 --> 01:32:08,633
he would have been killed immediately.

1407
01:32:11,739 --> 01:32:15,451
You are probably planning to dispose of me
for learning your secret,

1408
01:32:15,822 --> 01:32:16,986
but that will not happen.

1409
01:32:17,011 --> 01:32:19,013
I will be your opponent then.

1410
01:32:19,707 --> 01:32:21,875
Because there may just be a connection

1411
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:26,149
between the jutsu that had control over
the Fourth Mizukage and your ocular powers.

1412
01:32:29,232 --> 01:32:32,402
Lord Hokage, ninjutsu is prohibited
in this room.

1413
01:32:33,045 --> 01:32:34,964
You have lost your credibility.

1414
01:32:35,642 --> 01:32:40,230
Even if you hadn't resorted to this,
I may have chosen you, you know.

1415
01:32:40,786 --> 01:32:42,913
"May have chosen" was unacceptable.

1416
01:32:43,794 --> 01:32:46,074
I was prepared to use
any means necessary

1417
01:32:46,099 --> 01:32:48,060
in order to protect
the world of the ninja.

1418
01:32:48,948 --> 01:32:51,617
This world must become one.

1419
01:32:52,354 --> 01:32:54,860
In the same way that
the First Hokage, Hashirama,

1420
01:32:54,885 --> 01:32:57,899
united our people and
founded our village.

1421
01:32:59,506 --> 01:33:02,884
This time, I shall unite the villages
and create one ninja world.

1422
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:07,454
There is no way this ninja world can
be united through discussions alone.

1423
01:33:08,648 --> 01:33:12,068
It takes time to realize one's ideals.

1424
01:33:13,466 --> 01:33:16,761
Impatience makes one lose sight of
his surroundings and invites failure.

1425
01:33:17,058 --> 01:33:18,476
That's you right now.

1426
01:33:19,618 --> 01:33:23,580
Nothing will change by
working slowly and ethically.

1427
01:33:24,068 --> 01:33:27,905
Sooner or later, the Akatsuki will
destroy the ninja world.

1428
01:33:28,169 --> 01:33:31,506
Well, that is just an impossible dream.

1429
01:33:31,789 --> 01:33:33,915
It may sound noble, but ultimately,

1430
01:33:33,940 --> 01:33:37,986
it will only breed distrust,
ill will and resentment.

1431
01:33:38,464 --> 01:33:42,468
Why Danzo, we don't even trust
your words at this point.

1432
01:33:42,921 --> 01:33:47,551
Whether I am trusted or not,
it's the outcome that is essential.

1433
01:33:52,471 --> 01:33:54,640
Unable to trust each other.

1434
01:33:55,356 --> 01:33:59,683
If that is the world... If that is
being human, there is no future.

1435
01:34:00,888 --> 01:34:02,098
What is it you want to say?

1436
01:34:02,787 --> 01:34:05,539
Understanding and trusting
in one another...

1437
01:34:06,098 --> 01:34:09,184
If we lose that, only fear will remain
in the world.

1438
01:34:10,461 --> 01:34:13,631
Acting with no regard for what is right...
resigning oneself...

1439
01:34:13,631 --> 01:34:16,843
I find such things hard to
accept these days.

1440
01:34:17,498 --> 01:34:20,126
For a kid who knows nothing
about governing a village yet,

1441
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:24,065
you speak so simply of complex matters.

1442
01:34:25,006 --> 01:34:29,052
Now's your chance to
ask anything you'd like.

1443
01:34:29,730 --> 01:34:32,525
As your seniors, we're willing
to answer any questions you have.

1444
01:34:32,733 --> 01:34:34,110
Right, Danzo?

1445
01:34:34,660 --> 01:34:35,717
How dare you, you old geezer!

1446
01:34:35,742 --> 01:34:36,743
Don't, Kankuro.

1447
01:34:37,321 --> 01:34:40,116
He's still Tsuchikage.
The leader of another village.

1448
01:34:40,341 --> 01:34:42,885
Did she just say "still"?

1449
01:34:42,910 --> 01:34:43,911
Ignore them.

1450
01:34:45,961 --> 01:34:48,338
Then let me ask you this.

1451
01:34:48,916 --> 01:34:52,628
Sure. I will answer anything, kid.

1452
01:34:54,395 --> 01:34:57,564
When did you all discard your convictions?

1453
01:35:00,437 --> 01:35:01,980
<i>What a pure-hearted child.</i>

1454
01:35:04,375 --> 01:35:06,772
So Gaara, what will we do now?

1455
01:35:07,518 --> 01:35:11,063
We cooperated with the Hidden Leaf
on their mission to rescue Sasuke Uchiha.

1456
01:35:11,105 --> 01:35:13,524
But he's now descended
to joining the Akatsuki.

1457
01:35:13,929 --> 01:35:16,609
Sasuke Uchiha...

1458
01:35:17,829 --> 01:35:20,669
Hey! Don't go off without your guards!

1459
01:35:21,317 --> 01:35:23,486
Gramps, he's scored a point on you.

1460
01:35:24,035 --> 01:35:25,077
Shut it!

1461
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:28,554
Lord Tsuchikage... What do we do?

1462
01:35:28,856 --> 01:35:30,270
Shall we go forth to battle?

1463
01:35:30,441 --> 01:35:34,362
Fool! What if I throw my back out?!

1464
01:35:34,688 --> 01:35:37,942
But I want to see this Sasuke who
supposedly took down Bro Deidara.

1465
01:35:38,633 --> 01:35:39,759
Do as you please.

1466
01:35:40,244 --> 01:35:43,220
Just remember, if you get caught
in the Raikage's crossfire, you'll die.

1467
01:35:43,888 --> 01:35:44,889
So stay out his way.

1468
01:35:44,972 --> 01:35:46,057
Gotcha!

1469
01:35:46,230 --> 01:35:47,564
What about you, Akatsuchi?

1470
01:35:47,725 --> 01:35:52,813
I'll stay with Lord Tsuchikage,
in case he has trouble with his back.

1471
01:35:54,215 --> 01:35:55,550
Later, then.

1472
01:35:57,318 --> 01:36:00,060
Lord Danzo, please allow
one of us to go forth

1473
01:36:00,384 --> 01:36:02,928
in order to retrieve the Sharingan.

1474
01:36:03,324 --> 01:36:08,871
You Hidden Leaf will stay as you are!
Lord Raikage has so ordered!

1475
01:36:10,810 --> 01:36:12,686
Fu, Torune... stand down.

1476
01:36:13,602 --> 01:36:15,437
We will play nice for now.

1477
01:36:21,017 --> 01:36:22,894
It's no good.
There are too many of them.

1478
01:36:23,691 --> 01:36:25,652
We'll be found in no time and captured.

1479
01:36:25,748 --> 01:36:28,876
Zetsu, was it? I'll get him for this!

1480
01:36:34,213 --> 01:36:36,048
So that's how they use chakra?

1481
01:36:41,814 --> 01:36:43,607
I'm very irritated right now.

1482
01:36:46,368 --> 01:36:48,829
If you attack, I'll show no mercy.

1483
01:36:49,447 --> 01:36:51,991
I would say the same to you!

1484
01:36:58,472 --> 01:36:59,764
He repelled it?

1485
01:36:59,789 --> 01:37:01,666
It's similar to our sword technique!

1486
01:37:02,146 --> 01:37:04,774
Karin, you don't have to monitor
the Samurai anymore.

1487
01:37:05,134 --> 01:37:06,886
Focus on Danzo's location.

1488
01:37:06,911 --> 01:37:08,788
But what about the Samurai?

1489
01:37:09,629 --> 01:37:11,589
I'll deal with them.

1490
01:37:12,324 --> 01:37:13,575
Just find Danzo.

1491
01:37:21,304 --> 01:37:22,032
Huh?!

1492
01:37:26,103 --> 01:37:28,439
<i>Sasuke's chakra is different!</i>

1493
01:37:40,408 --> 01:37:44,579
Hey... After all his warnings telling me
not to kill anyone...

1494
01:37:44,909 --> 01:37:45,910
This is...

1495
01:37:47,890 --> 01:37:49,642
<i>He's not the same Sasuke
as before.</i>

1496
01:37:50,402 --> 01:37:53,196
<i>He's more intense than when he is
in the Curse Mark Second State.</i>

1497
01:37:54,556 --> 01:37:55,905
<i>And much...</i>

1498
01:37:57,106 --> 01:37:58,107
<i>colder.</i>

1499
01:38:10,420 --> 01:38:12,172
He's not alone!

1500
01:38:15,317 --> 01:38:17,903
There's one chakra that is erasing
many other chakras!

1501
01:38:18,027 --> 01:38:19,987
No doubt it's coming from Sasuke!

1502
01:38:20,114 --> 01:38:21,115
Which way?!

1503
01:38:21,689 --> 01:38:22,731
Right below us!

1504
01:38:24,532 --> 01:38:26,284
<i>Lord Raikage, you're not going to...</i>

1505
01:38:27,104 --> 01:38:28,730
<i>Something's coming. And it's huge!</i>

1506
01:38:30,189 --> 01:38:31,190
What is that?!

1507
01:38:39,710 --> 01:38:40,878
Hey brat!

1508
01:38:42,254 --> 01:38:45,132
I'm going to teach you
the fear of true fury!

1509
01:38:48,867 --> 01:38:50,952
Sasuke! Don't go in alone!

1510
01:38:51,718 --> 01:38:53,136
<i>He's lost his cool!</i>

1511
01:39:00,412 --> 01:39:02,539
<i>Water Style: Water Wall!</i>

1512
01:39:04,929 --> 01:39:05,930
<i>His attack, huh?</i>

1513
01:39:07,437 --> 01:39:09,690
<i>Lightning Style: Wave of Inspiration!</i>

1514
01:39:16,021 --> 01:39:17,946
Looks like the intel was right, Boss.

1515
01:39:17,971 --> 01:39:20,265
This guy seems to possess
a lightning chakra nature.

1516
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:22,054
Plus he has a fire chakra nature.

1517
01:39:22,847 --> 01:39:24,515
He's bound to use Fire Style
at some point.

1518
01:39:24,688 --> 01:39:27,316
Darui, keep Water Style
ready at all times.

1519
01:39:27,625 --> 01:39:28,336
Yeah.

1520
01:39:32,238 --> 01:39:34,699
Doesn't it look like
they have intel on Sasuke?

1521
01:39:34,981 --> 01:39:38,902
Hey, the one in the middle.
Isn't that...?

1522
01:39:39,625 --> 01:39:41,335
They're Hidden Cloud Jonin.

1523
01:39:41,665 --> 01:39:43,458
The huge one in the middle
is their Raikage.

1524
01:39:48,068 --> 01:39:49,656
They won't let us pass easily.

1525
01:39:51,129 --> 01:39:52,255
Seeking reinforcements!

1526
01:39:52,366 --> 01:39:53,367
Sasuke got us!

1527
01:39:54,689 --> 01:39:55,940
I'll stop him!

1528
01:39:56,233 --> 01:39:57,276
Something's coming!

1529
01:39:58,356 --> 01:40:00,275
<i>Lightning Illusion: Flash Pillar!</i>

1530
01:40:02,829 --> 01:40:03,871
Is he trying to blind us?!

1531
01:40:12,826 --> 01:40:13,827
<i>No!</i>

1532
01:40:14,589 --> 01:40:17,009
Jugo, don't waver.
This is a genjutsu.

1533
01:40:18,979 --> 01:40:21,469
<i>Not bad, Sharingan. However...</i>

1534
01:40:22,429 --> 01:40:25,057
You may have seen through
the genjutsu, but it's too late!

1535
01:40:41,473 --> 01:40:44,643
Damn it! My Executioner's Blade!

1536
01:40:45,081 --> 01:40:48,182
It'd already gotten cracked against
the Eight-Tails. It can't be helped.

1537
01:40:50,650 --> 01:40:52,688
Who told you to interfere?

1538
01:40:53,221 --> 01:40:57,058
We came to help you,
and this is what we get?

1539
01:40:57,493 --> 01:40:58,744
Although that's just like you.

1540
01:40:59,491 --> 01:41:01,669
Ninja sure fight rough.

1541
01:41:02,347 --> 01:41:03,588
They're crazy!

1542
01:41:03,892 --> 01:41:07,270
Shee, check and see if they've got
any other allies around.

1543
01:41:07,453 --> 01:41:10,122
I don't want to worry about
more popping in.

1544
01:41:10,782 --> 01:41:12,575
I'm sure there was one more.

1545
01:41:13,013 --> 01:41:16,580
But if I focus on that one,
it'll be hard to stay in the fight.

1546
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:18,318
We don't need you.

1547
01:41:19,132 --> 01:41:20,926
Boss and I can handle them.

1548
01:41:21,503 --> 01:41:22,514
<i>Uh-oh!</i>

1549
01:41:22,691 --> 01:41:26,578
<i>If I keep searching for Danzo like this,
I'll be the one found by that Shee.</i>

1550
01:41:27,252 --> 01:41:30,380
Karin will probably extinguish
her chakra and hide.

1551
01:41:30,648 --> 01:41:32,108
She's got that ability.

1552
01:41:33,435 --> 01:41:35,812
That guy in the back is probably
a Sensory-Type ninja.

1553
01:41:37,526 --> 01:41:39,152
We have to take him down.

1554
01:41:48,008 --> 01:41:48,953
I'll do it.

1555
01:42:02,850 --> 01:42:04,518
I'll kill 'em!

1556
01:42:05,517 --> 01:42:09,146
His change in personality is
more surprising than his appearance.

1557
01:42:09,278 --> 01:42:12,656
Focus! This guy's chakra is ridiculous!

1558
01:42:15,068 --> 01:42:19,615
Jugo voluntarily gave in to
his killer impulse this time.

1559
01:42:20,274 --> 01:42:23,319
You think he still remembers
that we're on his side?

1560
01:42:23,907 --> 01:42:26,910
Now then, who's first?!

1561
01:42:30,599 --> 01:42:32,392
Don't get cocky!

1562
01:42:52,171 --> 01:42:53,172
You're mine!

1563
01:43:01,606 --> 01:43:03,249
Nice blade you got there.

1564
01:43:03,658 --> 01:43:06,244
Can't have this just
because yours broke.

1565
01:43:19,923 --> 01:43:21,300
One down.

1566
01:43:26,067 --> 01:43:29,154
You can't take me down with
a mere Sharingan!

1567
01:43:30,269 --> 01:43:32,646
<i>Lord Raikage's nerve transmission
and reaction speed</i>

1568
01:43:32,671 --> 01:43:35,729
<i>are on par with that of
the Leaf's Yellow Flash.</i>

1569
01:43:35,953 --> 01:43:38,372
<i>Impressive that these guys are
keeping up as well as they are!</i>

1570
01:43:39,279 --> 01:43:42,699
<i>But Lord Raikage has manipulated Lightning
Style chakra to augment his reflexes.</i>

1571
01:43:42,724 --> 01:43:44,935
<i>Not even the Sharingan will
be able to keep up with him.</i>

1572
01:43:46,344 --> 01:43:47,762
<i>Plus, there's still...</i>

1573
01:43:53,460 --> 01:43:54,837
Die!

1574
01:44:04,865 --> 01:44:05,866
Did he get him?!

1575
01:44:07,101 --> 01:44:11,230
<i>He took Lord Raikage's blow
and still survived?!</i>

1576
01:44:20,146 --> 01:44:23,108
<i>I-Is this is... a genjutsu?</i>

1577
01:44:27,646 --> 01:44:31,317
<i>These guys are cleverly using
each other's attacks to divert attention.</i>

1578
01:44:31,711 --> 01:44:34,337
<i>And I fell for it. Damn it!</i>

1579
01:44:38,612 --> 01:44:41,573
<i>Can't... move...</i>

1580
01:44:47,055 --> 01:44:48,056
Shee?!

1581
01:44:57,691 --> 01:45:00,652
<i>Jugo can be useful, after all.</i>

1582
01:45:00,986 --> 01:45:02,988
<i>They can't detect me now.</i>

1583
01:45:03,489 --> 01:45:04,990
<i>Now's my chance to find Danzo.</i>

1584
01:45:06,033 --> 01:45:07,034
<i>Huh?!</i>

1585
01:45:10,500 --> 01:45:13,628
I killed him! I killed the guy!

1586
01:45:14,129 --> 01:45:16,821
Who's next?!

1587
01:45:33,801 --> 01:45:34,843
You're lying!

1588
01:45:34,889 --> 01:45:36,433
That's nonsense!

1589
01:45:37,071 --> 01:45:38,781
No, it can't be.

1590
01:45:39,544 --> 01:45:42,422
Stop joking around.
Who'd believe that story?

1591
01:45:42,712 --> 01:45:46,424
It's not a lie. That's
the truth about Itachi.

1592
01:45:47,802 --> 01:45:51,514
He died for Sasuke's sake and
for the Hidden Leaf Village.

1593
01:45:52,437 --> 01:45:53,814
What does that mean?

1594
01:45:53,977 --> 01:45:58,065
Even if it is true,
if Sasuke is aware of this,

1595
01:45:58,172 --> 01:46:00,133
why would he help the Akatsuki?

1596
01:46:00,681 --> 01:46:04,518
Knowing him, he would return to
the Hidden Leaf to carry on Itachi's will.

1597
01:46:06,571 --> 01:46:09,032
As Sasuke's teacher and his friends,

1598
01:46:09,235 --> 01:46:12,780
you might have assumed you understood
Sasuke's true feelings.

1599
01:46:12,949 --> 01:46:14,659
But you were badly mistaken.

1600
01:46:15,682 --> 01:46:19,269
He's the real thing. A true avenger.
That's what he is.

1601
01:46:19,722 --> 01:46:22,725
Did you turn Sasuke into that?!

1602
01:46:22,977 --> 01:46:24,645
No, I didn't.

1603
01:46:26,104 --> 01:46:28,856
Sasuke chose this himself.

1604
01:46:32,712 --> 01:46:35,173
It's a lie!

1605
01:46:36,435 --> 01:46:38,062
I took a gamble too.

1606
01:46:39,009 --> 01:46:41,095
Would Sasuke carry
on Itachi's wishes,

1607
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:43,623
or would he seek revenge against
the Hidden Leaf?

1608
01:46:45,393 --> 01:46:47,395
He chose vengeance.

1609
01:46:48,191 --> 01:46:51,528
In essence, he was meant to
be on our side.

1610
01:46:53,563 --> 01:46:57,401
Sasuke's goal at this moment is to
take revenge against the Hidden Leaf

1611
01:46:57,426 --> 01:47:00,596
for what they did to Itachi
and the Uchiha Clan.

1612
01:47:02,911 --> 01:47:03,912
Why?

1613
01:47:04,860 --> 01:47:06,779
Why him?

1614
01:47:08,211 --> 01:47:10,672
Why did this happen?

1615
01:47:11,708 --> 01:47:14,211
How could he turn to revenge?!

1616
01:47:14,751 --> 01:47:16,378
It was inevitable.

1617
01:47:16,842 --> 01:47:20,137
It is the Uchiha Clan's blood-soaked
destiny of hate.

1618
01:47:21,423 --> 01:47:25,135
Like a curse that has been
passed down through the ages.

1619
01:47:26,014 --> 01:47:27,015
A curse?

1620
01:47:27,496 --> 01:47:31,055
Yes. A curse of hatred,
which started generations ago

1621
01:47:31,080 --> 01:47:34,584
with the Sage of the Six Paths, 
founder of the ninja world.

1622
01:47:35,030 --> 01:47:36,323
The Sage of the Six Paths?

1623
01:47:37,370 --> 01:47:39,289
That's just a myth.

1624
01:47:39,793 --> 01:47:42,379
The Rinnegan was
no more than a mutation!

1625
01:47:42,404 --> 01:47:45,198
Myths are born from truth.

1626
01:47:46,392 --> 01:47:49,436
Long ago, the Sage of the Six Paths
preached the Ninshu

1627
01:47:49,518 --> 01:47:51,520
and tried to lead the way to peace.

1628
01:47:51,681 --> 01:47:54,309
But before he could realize his dream,
time ran out.

1629
01:47:56,567 --> 01:47:59,835
The Sage of the Six Paths decided to
entrust the power and will of the Ninshu

1630
01:47:59,860 --> 01:48:01,820
to his two children.

1631
01:48:03,518 --> 01:48:06,187
The older son was born with
the Sage's eyes.

1632
01:48:06,485 --> 01:48:09,071
He inherited the Sage's chakra
and mental energy,

1633
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:11,911
and believed that strength
was crucial to peace.

1634
01:48:13,727 --> 01:48:17,022
The younger son was born with
the gift of the Sage's body.

1635
01:48:17,087 --> 01:48:20,132
He inherited the Sage's life force
and physical energy,

1636
01:48:20,157 --> 01:48:22,951
and believed that love was
crucial to peace.

1637
01:48:25,085 --> 01:48:30,006
Ultimately, the Sage was forced to choose
his successor from his deathbed.

1638
01:48:30,352 --> 01:48:32,258
However, his decision

1639
01:48:32,283 --> 01:48:35,953
created a curse of hatred that
has continued for generations.

1640
01:48:36,368 --> 01:48:37,536
What do you mean by that?

1641
01:48:38,675 --> 01:48:41,637
Instead of his older son,
who sought strength,

1642
01:48:41,938 --> 01:48:43,939
the Sage felt that the younger son,
who sought love,

1643
01:48:43,964 --> 01:48:47,467
was more suitable, and named him
his successor.

1644
01:48:48,118 --> 01:48:52,122
The firstborn, who had long expected
to follow in his father's footsteps,

1645
01:48:52,384 --> 01:48:53,885
could not accept the decision.

1646
01:48:53,927 --> 01:48:57,347
Filled with rage,
he challenged his younger brother.

1647
01:49:00,301 --> 01:49:02,924
Even as time passed and
new generations were born,

1648
01:49:02,949 --> 01:49:05,702
the descendants of the two brothers,
continued to battle.

1649
01:49:07,594 --> 01:49:10,472
The descendants of the older brother
came to be known as the Uchiha.

1650
01:49:11,231 --> 01:49:15,026
And the descendants of the younger brother
were called the Senju.

1651
01:49:16,502 --> 01:49:20,339
As Madara Uchiha, my battle with
the First Hokage, Hashirama Senju,

1652
01:49:20,364 --> 01:49:21,949
was destined to take place.

1653
01:49:28,457 --> 01:49:30,709
This is only the second time I've met you.

1654
01:49:31,139 --> 01:49:34,851
But I can tell that you hold
the Senju's Will of Fire within you.

1655
01:49:35,665 --> 01:49:39,627
I can see the First Hokage inside you.

1656
01:49:41,309 --> 01:49:43,853
Even after death, he lives on.

1657
01:49:44,304 --> 01:49:46,764
He, whom I admired,
yet he was my rival.

1658
01:49:47,946 --> 01:49:50,365
And the man I hated most.

1659
01:49:52,710 --> 01:49:54,170
The Senju and the Uchiha.

1660
01:49:54,844 --> 01:49:56,680
The Will of Fire and hatred.

1661
01:49:57,083 --> 01:49:58,918
Naruto and Sasuke.

1662
01:49:59,887 --> 01:50:06,477
You both will probably be
the next chosen by fate.

1663
01:50:09,939 --> 01:50:13,234
The Uchiha was destined to
be a clan of vengeance.

1664
01:50:13,979 --> 01:50:17,774
Sasuke has shouldered
the entire burden of the Uchiha's hatred

1665
01:50:17,799 --> 01:50:21,052
and intends to strike the world
with that curse.

1666
01:50:22,294 --> 01:50:24,212
It is the most powerful weapon.

1667
01:50:24,237 --> 01:50:27,157
It's his friend and source of power,
this thing called hatred.

1668
01:50:31,251 --> 01:50:33,211
And it is Sasuke's ninja way!

1669
01:50:34,122 --> 01:50:36,166
<i>Elbow Bolt!</i>

1670
01:50:48,528 --> 01:50:52,491
A thrust attack using the Lightning Style
to increase force and penetration.

1671
01:50:52,948 --> 01:50:55,117
The same jutsu used
by Kakashi Hatake!

1672
01:50:55,918 --> 01:51:00,006
I wear Lightning Style armor,
yet you actually touched me.

1673
01:51:00,846 --> 01:51:02,848
That is some jutsu.

1674
01:51:03,716 --> 01:51:05,009
Damn it! It didn't work?!

1675
01:51:05,121 --> 01:51:06,623
No, it didn't.

1676
01:51:06,648 --> 01:51:08,442
Sasuke's dead.

1677
01:51:11,663 --> 01:51:14,207
<i>Liger Bomb!</i>

1678
01:51:21,124 --> 01:51:22,334
It's over.

1679
01:51:26,015 --> 01:51:26,794
Huh?

1680
01:51:38,550 --> 01:51:41,428
<i>So that's the Mangekyo Sharingan.</i>

1681
01:51:43,793 --> 01:51:45,002
Shee, you okay?

1682
01:51:45,567 --> 01:51:48,570
Darui... did you settle your fight?

1683
01:51:49,304 --> 01:51:50,305
Maybe.

1684
01:51:50,906 --> 01:51:54,868
No one's ever lived through
that Liger Bomb, until now.

1685
01:51:55,396 --> 01:51:57,815
Those bones and stuff...
What is he anyway?

1686
01:51:58,470 --> 01:52:00,472
I fell for his genjutsu and lost.

1687
01:52:01,628 --> 01:52:03,463
I still don't have full control of my body.

1688
01:52:04,904 --> 01:52:07,240
Geniuses like him appear once in a while.

1689
01:52:08,431 --> 01:52:09,432
Reinforcements?!

1690
01:52:20,634 --> 01:52:23,136
Hey Shee... The Uchiha's eye...

1691
01:52:23,178 --> 01:52:25,096
Doesn't it seem a bit different
from before?

1692
01:52:26,394 --> 01:52:28,146
Mangekyo Sharingan?!

1693
01:52:28,860 --> 01:52:33,318
<i>I get it. That's what made
Lord Raikage activate that much.</i>

1694
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:36,124
<i>He intends to counter with
his Body Flicker Jutsu.</i>

1695
01:52:41,173 --> 01:52:43,251
Maybe I'm too weak against
the Lightning Style.

1696
01:52:43,673 --> 01:52:46,467
My body's too numb and
can't liquefy properly.

1697
01:52:48,029 --> 01:52:50,490
<i>Raikage's chakra has grown enormous.</i>

1698
01:52:50,872 --> 01:52:52,666
<i>He's at Tailed Beast levels!</i>

1699
01:52:55,168 --> 01:52:56,962
Come on, brat!

1700
01:53:04,291 --> 01:53:05,417
<i>Amaterasu!</i>

1701
01:53:13,012 --> 01:53:14,138
Put out the fire!

1702
01:53:14,163 --> 01:53:16,207
It's not ordinary fire!
Don't get close to it!

1703
01:53:17,959 --> 01:53:20,545
<i>Lateral Bolt of Pain!</i>

1704
01:53:22,117 --> 01:53:24,578
<i>He's manipulating the Black Flames?!</i>

1705
01:53:24,781 --> 01:53:26,616
<i>He can even change
their chakra form!</i>

1706
01:53:26,783 --> 01:53:29,661
<i>Don't tell me he's more proficient
with the Black Flames than Itachi?</i>

1707
01:53:32,823 --> 01:53:35,659
Don't underestimate the Raikage!

1708
01:53:37,567 --> 01:53:39,319
Lord Raikage! Impossible...

1709
01:53:39,560 --> 01:53:41,562
He's sacrificing his left arm.

1710
01:53:47,505 --> 01:53:49,256
You're finished!

1711
01:53:50,098 --> 01:53:52,390
<i>Guillotine Drop!</i>

1712
01:53:53,219 --> 01:53:54,345
<i>Inferno Style: Flame Control!</i>

1713
01:54:00,267 --> 01:54:01,268
<i>Sand!</i>

1714
01:54:02,542 --> 01:54:03,543
<i>This is...</i>

1715
01:54:12,811 --> 01:54:14,312
Gaara of the Sand.

1716
01:54:17,086 --> 01:54:18,379
<i>Wind Scythe Jutsu!</i>

1717
01:54:24,362 --> 01:54:27,991
So these are the flames
that never burn out, Amaterasu, huh?

1718
01:54:28,402 --> 01:54:30,320
You Samurai, get back.

1719
01:54:30,662 --> 01:54:32,914
This is a problem for the ninja world.

1720
01:54:33,367 --> 01:54:36,162
There is no need for Samurai
to become casualties.

1721
01:54:37,214 --> 01:54:39,507
Th-Thank you, Lord Kazekage.

1722
01:54:40,879 --> 01:54:42,171
What's going on?

1723
01:54:42,466 --> 01:54:44,468
Why did you interfere, Kazekage?!

1724
01:54:44,736 --> 01:54:47,280
Whether I punish you or not
depends on your answer!

1725
01:54:47,826 --> 01:54:49,994
If you had continued and
performed another attack,

1726
01:54:50,019 --> 01:54:52,981
the Black Flames would
have further injured you.

1727
01:54:54,103 --> 01:54:57,357
Besides, I wish to speak
to Sasuke Uchiha.

1728
01:55:04,672 --> 01:55:05,673
Boss!

1729
01:55:05,824 --> 01:55:07,617
Shee, hurry and stop the bleeding!

1730
01:55:07,926 --> 01:55:09,928
I'm going to attack Sasuke
the minute you're done.

1731
01:55:09,969 --> 01:55:10,970
Yes sir!

1732
01:55:15,078 --> 01:55:16,955
<i>Sasuke was able to lay
a hand on Lord Raikage,</i>

1733
01:55:16,980 --> 01:55:18,732
<i>who was clad in
his Lightning Style armor.</i>

1734
01:55:18,818 --> 01:55:21,404
<i>And he's still alive despite
two heavy attacks.</i>

1735
01:55:23,085 --> 01:55:26,839
<i>Perhaps Sasuke captured Bee after all.</i>

1736
01:55:28,835 --> 01:55:31,046
Your eyes are still as they were
in the past.

1737
01:55:35,371 --> 01:55:39,709
<i>I once told you that you
have eyes like mine.</i>

1738
01:55:40,757 --> 01:55:42,353
<i>Eyes that seek strength.</i>

1739
01:55:42,378 --> 01:55:45,047
<i>Eyes overflowing with hate
and a hunger for blood.</i>

1740
01:55:45,430 --> 01:55:51,436
<i>Eyes itching to kill the one who threw you
into the hell called solitude.</i>

1741
01:55:59,468 --> 01:56:02,721
Making revenge your sustenance
resolves nothing.

1742
01:56:02,746 --> 01:56:04,665
I learned that lesson personally.

1743
01:56:05,604 --> 01:56:07,314
It's not too late for you.

1744
01:56:07,889 --> 01:56:11,142
Do not cast yourself into a world where
you are all alone, obsessed with hate.

1745
01:56:12,301 --> 01:56:13,970
You won't be able to return.

1746
01:56:15,462 --> 01:56:19,257
And if I returned?
What would I find there?

1747
01:56:19,584 --> 01:56:20,668
Forget it, Gaara.

1748
01:56:21,740 --> 01:56:24,367
Naruto already failed at convincing him.

1749
01:56:25,045 --> 01:56:28,324
He's just a criminal now, who has
fallen to the level of the Akatsuki.

1750
01:56:29,791 --> 01:56:30,667
He's not like you.

1751
01:56:30,805 --> 01:56:32,974
Besides, neither the Raikage
nor the others

1752
01:56:32,999 --> 01:56:35,126
who have been victimized by
the Akatsuki will remain silent.

1753
01:56:35,430 --> 01:56:39,017
After attacking the Five Kage Summit,
he's now wanted internationally.

1754
01:56:39,753 --> 01:56:41,839
This guy has no future.

1755
01:56:45,171 --> 01:56:48,925
Sasuke, you and I are alike.

1756
01:56:49,676 --> 01:56:52,345
We've both walked through
the darkness of this world.

1757
01:56:52,667 --> 01:56:56,588
That's why you should be able to see
even the faintest glimmer of light.

1758
01:56:57,508 --> 01:57:00,678
In the past and even now.

1759
01:57:03,179 --> 01:57:05,264
I closed my eyes long ago.

1760
01:57:06,169 --> 01:57:09,255
My goals exist only in the darkness.

1761
01:57:09,565 --> 01:57:11,484
Leave your personal feelings
out of this.

1762
01:57:11,509 --> 01:57:13,094
You are the Kazekage.

1763
01:57:20,970 --> 01:57:21,971
I know.

1764
01:57:25,777 --> 01:57:27,070
I understand.

1765
01:57:40,621 --> 01:57:43,416
I'm impressed that you can guard
against my Inferno Style so effectively.

1766
01:57:43,716 --> 01:57:45,760
Your ultimate defense is
in good shape.

1767
01:57:47,385 --> 01:57:49,017
A-Amazing.

1768
01:57:50,680 --> 01:57:53,266
<i>Found them! Danzo's among them!</i>

1769
01:57:55,579 --> 01:57:58,373
It seems the enemy has
a Sensory-Type ninja.

1770
01:57:58,763 --> 01:58:00,848
They may come here in time.

1771
01:58:00,995 --> 01:58:01,996
What do we do?

1772
01:58:02,687 --> 01:58:03,980
Nothing for now.

1773
01:58:04,453 --> 01:58:07,706
When they arrive,
we'll slip out during the chaos.

1774
01:58:08,122 --> 01:58:10,041
Stop whispering over there!

1775
01:58:10,726 --> 01:58:12,728
Sorry, but I'm a Sensory-Type too.

1776
01:58:13,206 --> 01:58:15,208
I'm fully aware that the enemy is on to us.

1777
01:58:15,961 --> 01:58:18,047
But you are not to make a move.

1778
01:58:18,390 --> 01:58:20,266
We'll deal with the enemy.

1779
01:58:21,534 --> 01:58:24,787
<i>It seems this summit is about
to become very interesting.</i>

1780
01:58:27,897 --> 01:58:29,065
Are you done yet, Shee?!

1781
01:58:29,419 --> 01:58:31,045
Just a little longer.

1782
01:58:32,198 --> 01:58:33,783
Comrades of the Hidden Sand!

1783
01:58:34,090 --> 01:58:35,350
I will fire the first shot!

1784
01:58:35,375 --> 01:58:37,002
Press ahead after me!

1785
01:58:37,314 --> 01:58:38,315
Right!

1786
01:58:38,580 --> 01:58:41,332
<i>Gale Style: Laser Circus!</i>

1787
01:58:41,686 --> 01:58:43,771
<i>Red Secret Technique: Puppet Triad!</i>

1788
01:58:44,183 --> 01:58:45,580
<i>Cyclone Scythe Jutsu!</i>

1789
01:58:45,977 --> 01:58:47,854
<i>Sand Shower Barrage!</i>

1790
01:59:01,724 --> 01:59:03,059
<i>Wh-What is this?!</i>

1791
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:16,514
Gaara... This is even greater than
your ultimate defense.

1792
01:59:18,650 --> 01:59:21,653
Did he use that to guard
against my attacks?

1793
01:59:22,729 --> 01:59:23,946
<i>This chakra...</i>

1794
01:59:23,971 --> 01:59:25,806
<i>It's the same as that genjutsu earlier.</i>

1795
01:59:26,216 --> 01:59:28,843
This doesn't look good.

1796
01:59:30,855 --> 01:59:32,940
<i>Was this what he wanted to test?</i>

1797
01:59:34,011 --> 01:59:37,556
<i>This chakra...
He's no longer the old Sasuke.</i>

1798
01:59:37,987 --> 01:59:39,155
<i>It's too cold.</i>

1799
01:59:40,281 --> 01:59:42,075
What is that?

1800
01:59:43,683 --> 01:59:46,561
The power... of darkness?

1801
01:59:50,833 --> 01:59:55,505
A power that only those who have awakened
the Mangekyo in both eyes can achieve.

1802
01:59:56,172 --> 01:59:58,216
This is the third power...

1803
01:59:58,567 --> 01:59:59,819
Susano'o.

1804
02:00:02,200 --> 02:00:04,243
Susano'o?

1805
02:00:05,556 --> 02:00:07,892
So that's the Mangekyo Sharingan?

1806
02:00:08,306 --> 02:00:14,186
That Uchiha... Always has something
hidden up his sleeve.

1807
02:00:16,818 --> 02:00:19,320
Darui, everyone from the Sand!
Please step back!

1808
02:00:31,124 --> 02:00:32,708
<i>He's aiming for the pillars!</i>

1809
02:00:33,501 --> 02:00:34,419
The pillars!

1810
02:00:34,460 --> 02:00:36,170
The ceiling won't hold!

1811
02:00:43,883 --> 02:00:45,176
What the hell?!

1812
02:01:24,289 --> 02:01:26,624
Were you able to pinpoint
Danzo's location?

1813
02:01:27,788 --> 02:01:28,789
Y-Yeah.

1814
02:01:31,673 --> 02:01:32,674
Take me there.

1815
02:01:34,959 --> 02:01:37,211
What about Jugo and Suigetsu?

1816
02:01:37,891 --> 02:01:39,810
Their chakra is still...

1817
02:01:39,835 --> 02:01:42,671
Never mind! Danzo comes first.

1818
02:01:48,566 --> 02:01:50,068
Hurry and take me there.

1819
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:52,501
O-Okay.

1820
02:02:06,914 --> 02:02:08,416
<i>They're all right too.</i>

1821
02:02:11,289 --> 02:02:13,791
Sorry... Kazekage.

1822
02:02:15,745 --> 02:02:19,499
Looks like Sasuke used
that instant to get away.

1823
02:02:19,748 --> 02:02:21,333
If things are this bad here,

1824
02:02:21,358 --> 02:02:23,777
who knows what may have
happened to the others.

1825
02:02:33,521 --> 02:02:35,397
We're going after Sasuke immediately!

1826
02:02:35,863 --> 02:02:37,532
Looks like he's headed up.

1827
02:02:41,788 --> 02:02:44,999
<i>Naruto... What would you have done?</i>

1828
02:02:51,157 --> 02:02:55,161
<i>Good thing that blade missed, but still...</i>

1829
02:02:56,794 --> 02:02:59,588
<i>I wonder how Sasuke,
Karin and Jugo are doing.</i>

1830
02:03:14,783 --> 02:03:16,409
I'll still make it.

1831
02:03:38,512 --> 02:03:39,513
All right.

1832
02:03:40,629 --> 02:03:41,630
Naruto...

1833
02:03:42,974 --> 02:03:46,186
You will probably end up
fighting Sasuke one day.

1834
02:03:46,672 --> 02:03:50,176
Rather... I will throw Sasuke at you.

1835
02:03:51,011 --> 02:03:53,638
A battle that was predestined ages ago.

1836
02:03:54,141 --> 02:03:56,894
I'll have Sasuke prove
the existence of the Uchiha.

1837
02:03:57,334 --> 02:03:59,784
Sasuke isn't your toy!

1838
02:03:59,809 --> 02:04:01,352
Quit making selfish plans!

1839
02:04:01,870 --> 02:04:04,167
You think you can make Sasuke
have a change of heart,

1840
02:04:04,192 --> 02:04:05,735
like you did with Nagato?

1841
02:04:06,236 --> 02:04:08,905
That's just as selfish, Naruto.

1842
02:04:10,141 --> 02:04:15,730
Controlling people requires the skill to
manipulate the darkness in their souls.

1843
02:04:16,824 --> 02:04:20,369
Although, Nagato just happened to
be easily influenced by others.

1844
02:04:20,711 --> 02:04:22,880
Don't compare Nagato to yourself!

1845
02:04:23,499 --> 02:04:27,169
His ways were different,
but he truly wished for peace!

1846
02:04:27,490 --> 02:04:28,991
But you're different!

1847
02:04:30,951 --> 02:04:31,952
You're right.

1848
02:04:34,134 --> 02:04:35,886
The existence of the Uchiha...

1849
02:04:36,369 --> 02:04:40,581
If that's all you want to validate,
why hunt the Tailed Beasts?

1850
02:04:41,206 --> 02:04:42,833
Just what is your goal?

1851
02:04:43,344 --> 02:04:44,637
What do you hope to accomplish?

1852
02:04:45,986 --> 02:04:47,363
Let's see...

1853
02:04:48,123 --> 02:04:52,336
If anything, it's to become complete.

1854
02:04:53,063 --> 02:04:54,064
Complete?!

1855
02:04:54,526 --> 02:04:55,986
What do you mean?!

1856
02:04:58,329 --> 02:05:00,956
Talking to you is meaningless.

1857
02:05:01,304 --> 02:05:03,306
I'll explain more
in an appropriate place.

1858
02:05:05,815 --> 02:05:08,859
Our conversation... was quite fun.

1859
02:05:09,461 --> 02:05:10,712
So long.

1860
02:05:16,842 --> 02:05:17,801
Sasuke...

1861
02:05:19,005 --> 02:05:20,798
There's absolutely no trace left.

1862
02:05:21,480 --> 02:05:24,608
Space-Time Ninjutsu...
It's such a troublesome jutsu.

1863
02:05:29,118 --> 02:05:31,913
Kakashi-sensei, what he was saying...

1864
02:05:32,203 --> 02:05:35,081
It's dangerous to believe his story.

1865
02:05:35,106 --> 02:05:37,196
But if it's true, Sasuke is-

1866
02:05:37,221 --> 02:05:38,222
Naruto...

1867
02:05:41,090 --> 02:05:43,759
I know how you feel,
but you must not be impatient.

1868
02:05:45,816 --> 02:05:50,321
For now, we'll keep what Madara
said to ourselves...

1869
02:05:50,809 --> 02:05:52,102
in absolute secrecy.

1870
02:05:52,881 --> 02:05:55,926
We're in the midst of reconstruction
and must avoid unnecessary mayhem.

1871
02:05:56,519 --> 02:06:00,064
Furthermore, until we cross-check
the facts, we can't trust him.

1872
02:06:01,566 --> 02:06:04,352
There's too much that
we don't know about his claim

1873
02:06:04,377 --> 02:06:09,132
that the higher ups in the Hidden Leaf used
Itachi to slaughter the Uchiha clan.

1874
02:06:10,277 --> 02:06:13,072
Especially you, Naruto.
Do you understand?

1875
02:06:16,343 --> 02:06:17,720
Yeah, I know.

1876
02:06:22,358 --> 02:06:23,131
He's coming.

1877
02:06:34,771 --> 02:06:35,518
Above?!

1878
02:06:56,942 --> 02:06:58,110
He's using the Sharingan.

1879
02:07:00,958 --> 02:07:02,877
Sasuke! Danzo is escaping!

1880
02:07:09,462 --> 02:07:11,464
Lord Mizukage and Chojuro, stay here!

1881
02:07:11,777 --> 02:07:13,487
I'm going after Danzo!

1882
02:07:13,577 --> 02:07:16,204
Since the summit isn't over yet!

1883
02:07:16,378 --> 02:07:19,339
All right. But don't pursue him too far.

1884
02:07:19,709 --> 02:07:22,378
Yes ma'am!
I'll leave the Akatsuki rebels to you.

1885
02:07:23,736 --> 02:07:25,780
My back can't take it.

1886
02:07:25,982 --> 02:07:28,443
You people can deal with them
as you please.

1887
02:07:28,876 --> 02:07:30,127
Sounds good to me.

1888
02:07:30,741 --> 02:07:32,118
Karin! Come!

1889
02:07:43,213 --> 02:07:44,131
<i>There it is.</i>

1890
02:07:44,156 --> 02:07:47,617
<i>Lady Mizukage's Kekkei Genkai,
Lava Style Jutsu!</i>

1891
02:07:50,681 --> 02:07:53,527
You Akatsuki manipulated
the Fourth Mizukage

1892
02:07:53,552 --> 02:07:56,096
and trampled all over the Hidden Mist.

1893
02:07:59,530 --> 02:08:04,076
And yet when I look at you closely,
you of the Uchiha Clan are quite handsome.

1894
02:08:06,266 --> 02:08:07,476
Don't interfere.

1895
02:08:10,541 --> 02:08:12,960
Such a fine man...
What a waste.

1896
02:08:15,783 --> 02:08:19,995
I'll at least give you a kiss
that will make you melt.

1897
02:08:20,794 --> 02:08:22,212
A-A kiss?!

1898
02:08:23,049 --> 02:08:25,232
Just who the hell are you?!

1899
02:08:25,257 --> 02:08:27,516
And quit trying to seduce him,
you old hag!

1900
02:08:28,773 --> 02:08:31,526
<i>Lady Mizukage is intent on fighting!</i>

1901
02:08:32,045 --> 02:08:35,923
<i>I must protect her! But...</i>

1902
02:08:36,587 --> 02:08:39,214
<i>He's the one who killed Zabuza.</i>

1903
02:08:39,823 --> 02:08:41,784
<i>Do I even have a chance?</i>

1904
02:08:43,304 --> 02:08:46,837
<i>Yes, even someone like me
has a chance. I can do it.</i>

1905
02:08:49,009 --> 02:08:50,677
<i>I have to keep telling myself that.</i>

1906
02:08:51,070 --> 02:08:52,613
Lord Tsuchikage,

1907
02:08:52,835 --> 02:08:55,880
if you're not going to participate,
please keep your head lowered.

1908
02:09:02,414 --> 02:09:03,415
<i>Not that again!</i>

1909
02:09:10,077 --> 02:09:12,454
Keep my head lowered? The nerve.

1910
02:09:12,801 --> 02:09:13,757
Chojuro!

1911
02:09:13,782 --> 02:09:14,908
Y-Yes ma'am!

1912
02:09:17,377 --> 02:09:19,213
<i>Hiramekarei, unleash!</i>

1913
02:09:37,638 --> 02:09:40,057
<i>Every cell in my body hurts.</i>

1914
02:09:41,678 --> 02:09:44,847
<i>Is this the side effect of using
Susano'o...</i>

1915
02:09:45,412 --> 02:09:48,582
<i>for an extended period?</i>

1916
02:09:50,428 --> 02:09:52,847
<i>I haven't even achieved
complete possession form</i>

1917
02:09:52,872 --> 02:09:54,290
<i>and yet there's so much pain.</i>

1918
02:09:54,315 --> 02:09:55,984
<i>What did Itachi endure?</i>

1919
02:10:00,589 --> 02:10:02,216
It's just the two of us now.

1920
02:10:06,586 --> 02:10:09,214
<i>S-So he was killed?</i>

1921
02:10:09,745 --> 02:10:12,873
<i>I couldn't read his chakra,
so I thought something was strange.</i>

1922
02:10:16,932 --> 02:10:18,308
The wall next to you...

1923
02:10:19,415 --> 02:10:23,169
I closed it up after that first attack.

1924
02:10:23,897 --> 02:10:26,399
It's now a completely sealed room.

1925
02:10:27,526 --> 02:10:29,069
There's no way to escape.

1926
02:10:30,120 --> 02:10:34,166
I use three chakra natures:
Fire, Water and Earth.

1927
02:10:34,639 --> 02:10:37,768
That's why I possess two Kekkei Genkai.

1928
02:10:38,914 --> 02:10:40,957
<i>Vapor Style: Solid Fog Jutsu.</i>

1929
02:10:42,776 --> 02:10:43,777
Sasuke!

1930
02:10:46,475 --> 02:10:47,977
<i>He's on the other side of that wall.</i>

1931
02:10:56,011 --> 02:10:57,012
It's melting.

1932
02:11:05,267 --> 02:11:08,187
<i>This is bad.
Sasuke's chakra is weakening!</i>

1933
02:11:08,635 --> 02:11:10,804
<i>He's overdoing it!</i>

1934
02:11:11,163 --> 02:11:15,334
It seems you got roughed up
pretty badly by Lord Raikage earlier.

1935
02:11:15,441 --> 02:11:18,444
Sorry, but I have no intention
of helping you.

1936
02:11:18,945 --> 02:11:24,534
It pains my heart every time
I see such a handsome man melt away.

1937
02:11:25,437 --> 02:11:26,688
But you have to die.

1938
02:11:33,071 --> 02:11:34,906
<i>So this time, it's corrosive acid mist?</i>

1939
02:11:40,035 --> 02:11:41,036
What?

1940
02:11:45,232 --> 02:11:46,233
Wha—?!

1941
02:11:49,156 --> 02:11:50,407
What is it?!

1942
02:11:52,770 --> 02:11:53,771
<i>This chakra...</i>

1943
02:11:56,458 --> 02:11:59,545
Th-This is that Akatsuki from earlier.

1944
02:12:00,321 --> 02:12:02,448
<i>It's that man's...</i>

1945
02:12:04,658 --> 02:12:08,621
<i>I can't believe no one detected
my Spore jutsu.</i>

1946
02:12:08,662 --> 02:12:12,124
<i>The Five Kage are just a bunch of idiots.</i>

1947
02:12:12,589 --> 02:12:13,632
<i>He's...</i>

1948
02:12:16,106 --> 02:12:17,441
<i>using my chakra.</i>

1949
02:12:17,882 --> 02:12:20,050
He's absorbing chakra and growing?!

1950
02:12:20,266 --> 02:12:21,434
When did he do this?

1951
02:12:22,350 --> 02:12:26,146
It's a time-delay jutsu that
he planted before Raikage beat him.

1952
02:12:27,722 --> 02:12:28,723
Why you-

1953
02:12:38,478 --> 02:12:39,855
Damn... What now?!

1954
02:12:42,631 --> 02:12:45,217
My chakra is returning!

1955
02:12:45,813 --> 02:12:47,189
This is...

1956
02:13:00,508 --> 02:13:02,093
Sasuke! Are you all right?!

1957
02:13:05,841 --> 02:13:08,176
<i>The mist will leak to where
the others are.</i>

1958
02:13:08,373 --> 02:13:09,958
<i>I have to adjust the pH level.</i>

1959
02:13:14,471 --> 02:13:16,223
It seems they're having difficulties.

1960
02:13:16,885 --> 02:13:20,639
Akatsuchi, shall we go and
lend them a hand soon?

1961
02:13:20,789 --> 02:13:21,790
Okay!

1962
02:13:37,412 --> 02:13:39,665
<i>Earth Style: Weighted Boulder Jutsu.</i>

1963
02:13:58,708 --> 02:14:01,127
So a brat like you defeated Deidara?

1964
02:14:02,019 --> 02:14:06,607
Well, I hold no grudge against you,
but many ninja wish you dead.

1965
02:14:08,999 --> 02:14:10,250
So long.

1966
02:14:12,333 --> 02:14:15,544
<i>Particle Style: Atomic Dismantling Jutsu!</i>

1967
02:14:20,176 --> 02:14:21,386
Sasuke!

1968
02:14:26,458 --> 02:14:29,628
Sasuke's chakra is... gone!

1969
02:14:30,609 --> 02:14:32,277
You're right,

1970
02:14:32,471 --> 02:14:36,141
because I've disassembled his body
at a near molecular level!

1971
02:14:37,345 --> 02:14:38,972
You're next.

1972
02:14:45,394 --> 02:14:47,312
Wh-Why you...

1973
02:14:51,201 --> 02:14:52,244
Sasuke?

1974
02:14:53,527 --> 02:14:55,195
Where is Sasuke?!

1975
02:14:57,434 --> 02:14:58,435
Kankuro.

1976
02:14:58,790 --> 02:14:59,791
Got it.

1977
02:15:08,011 --> 02:15:10,054
Th-Thank you.

1978
02:15:10,264 --> 02:15:11,349
I am indebted to you.

1979
02:15:11,976 --> 02:15:14,186
Tsuchikage! Where is Sasuke?!

1980
02:15:15,570 --> 02:15:17,114
I turned him into dust.

1981
02:15:17,734 --> 02:15:20,361
What?! I wanted to do that!

1982
02:15:20,583 --> 02:15:21,504
You had no right-

1983
02:15:21,529 --> 02:15:24,365
<i>You still... have a chance.</i>

1984
02:15:25,388 --> 02:15:27,474
<i>So stop making a fuss, Raikage.</i>

1985
02:15:39,812 --> 02:15:41,897
My name is Madara Uchiha.

1986
02:15:48,052 --> 02:15:49,053
Sasuke!

1987
02:15:50,579 --> 02:15:53,457
I have something I want
to explain to you all.

1988
02:15:54,203 --> 02:15:57,665
And once you comprehend it,
I want to pose a question.

1989
02:15:59,148 --> 02:16:00,357
What is it?!

1990
02:16:01,298 --> 02:16:03,092
It's about my plan...

1991
02:16:04,638 --> 02:16:06,682
Project Tsuki no Me.

1992
02:16:10,333 --> 02:16:13,795
It seems Shee was right.
The Hokage did make an escape.

1993
02:16:14,124 --> 02:16:16,668
Yes, because of Sasuke.

1994
02:16:26,478 --> 02:16:29,606
Nothing planned by the Akatsuki
is going to be good.

1995
02:16:29,966 --> 02:16:31,593
Who knows what you're up to?

1996
02:16:31,618 --> 02:16:32,619
<i>Sasuke is...</i>

1997
02:16:34,039 --> 02:16:35,791
Bring Sasuke back!

1998
02:16:36,167 --> 02:16:38,461
Then listen to my explanation.

1999
02:16:38,799 --> 02:16:40,509
It will all depend on your answer.

2000
02:16:40,648 --> 02:16:42,901
Calm down, Raikage.

2001
02:16:43,371 --> 02:16:45,540
Let's hear him out,
and take it from there.

2002
02:16:48,380 --> 02:16:50,465
Revive Sasuke.

2003
02:16:52,935 --> 02:16:55,612
So that's Madara's ability?

2004
02:16:55,637 --> 02:16:57,764
Space-Time Ninjutsu.

2005
02:17:03,481 --> 02:17:04,565
<i>Where am I?</i>

2006
02:17:06,872 --> 02:17:10,709
Now then, are you all ready to listen?

2007
02:17:11,668 --> 02:17:14,588
Why are you trying to win Sasuke over?

2008
02:17:15,602 --> 02:17:19,147
A Sharingan capable of awakening
the Susano'o is rare.

2009
02:17:19,354 --> 02:17:21,773
I like to stock up on good eyes.

2010
02:17:22,914 --> 02:17:24,957
By battling the Five Kage,

2011
02:17:24,982 --> 02:17:27,193
I wanted him to hone
his ocular powers even more.

2012
02:17:27,608 --> 02:17:29,902
I'm the one who sent Sasuke here.

2013
02:17:30,756 --> 02:17:34,009
I was intending on weakening the Five Kage
and taking you all hostage.

2014
02:17:34,726 --> 02:17:36,895
It seems that is still not possible.

2015
02:17:37,482 --> 02:17:39,567
Taking us hostage?
For what purpose?!

2016
02:17:40,170 --> 02:17:44,007
To smoothly implement
the aforementioned Project Tsuki no Me.

2017
02:17:44,355 --> 02:17:48,776
It's quite shocking to learn that
Madara Uchiha is still alive,

2018
02:17:49,119 --> 02:17:52,873
but why would a man of your skill
resort to such a roundabout method?

2019
02:17:53,325 --> 02:17:56,996
Surely, you have the strength
to bring any plan to fruition.

2020
02:17:58,031 --> 02:18:02,185
The injuries I sustained during
my battle with Hashirama were too severe.

2021
02:18:02,424 --> 02:18:04,885
I have no strength in me now.

2022
02:18:05,802 --> 02:18:09,097
You could say I am merely
a shell of my old self.

2023
02:18:09,289 --> 02:18:13,835
Is this a plan to restore yourself?

2024
02:18:15,384 --> 02:18:18,553
You could say that.
But that's not all.

2025
02:18:19,310 --> 02:18:21,020
What are you scheming?!

2026
02:18:21,045 --> 02:18:23,589
Just what is this Project Tsuki no Me?!

2027
02:18:24,765 --> 02:18:28,602
I want to take my time talking to you.
Let me sit down.

2028
02:18:28,825 --> 02:18:31,536
We're asking you
what kind of plan it is!

2029
02:18:35,728 --> 02:18:37,897
All shall become one with me,

2030
02:18:38,112 --> 02:18:40,865
and result in a complete
possession form that unites all.

2031
02:18:45,331 --> 02:18:48,834
Become one? Unite all?

2032
02:18:49,317 --> 02:18:50,860
What do you mean?!

2033
02:18:53,821 --> 02:18:55,448
The Uchiha have
an ancient stone tablet

2034
02:18:55,473 --> 02:18:57,058
that has been passed down
through the generations.

2035
02:18:57,163 --> 02:18:59,624
It still exists underground in
the Hidden Leaf Village.

2036
02:19:00,798 --> 02:19:05,570
Upon it are written secrets, engraved
by the Sage of the Six Paths himself.

2037
02:19:05,908 --> 02:19:08,452
It cannot be read unless
you possess ocular powers.

2038
02:19:08,477 --> 02:19:12,590
With the Sharingan, the Mangekyo
Sharingan and Rinnegan, in that order,

2039
02:19:12,615 --> 02:19:14,742
the contents become
increasingly decipherable.

2040
02:19:15,228 --> 02:19:20,608
Your story is unlikely.
The Sage of the Six Paths doesn't...

2041
02:19:20,637 --> 02:19:22,133
It is the truth!

2042
02:19:22,608 --> 02:19:26,213
He did exist.
And he left the stone tablet.

2043
02:19:26,774 --> 02:19:28,568
Don't change the subject!

2044
02:19:29,850 --> 02:19:33,938
What does your plan have to do
with the Sage of the Six Paths?!

2045
02:19:34,502 --> 02:19:37,045
Do you know why he became
a legendary figure

2046
02:19:37,070 --> 02:19:41,074
and a godlike figure
that is revered as the God of Shinobi?

2047
02:19:43,459 --> 02:19:47,297
There lies the link between my plan
and this man.

2048
02:19:47,829 --> 02:19:49,289
Madara Uchiha...

2049
02:19:49,314 --> 02:19:51,995
You possess the Mangekyo Sharingan
and among the Akatsuki,

2050
02:19:52,020 --> 02:19:53,730
there was one who possessed
the Rinnegan.

2051
02:19:54,333 --> 02:19:56,585
You know everything, don't you?

2052
02:19:56,746 --> 02:19:57,872
We're listening.

2053
02:19:58,865 --> 02:20:02,869
He once saved the world
from a certain monster.

2054
02:20:03,456 --> 02:20:04,582
Monster?

2055
02:20:05,339 --> 02:20:10,469
Gaara, you also had one part of
that monster sealed inside you.

2056
02:20:11,846 --> 02:20:14,519
That monster was the combination of
every Tailed Beast in existence.

2057
02:20:14,544 --> 02:20:16,963
Something that possessed
the most powerful chakra.

2058
02:20:19,499 --> 02:20:20,834
The Ten-Tails!

2059
02:20:21,975 --> 02:20:24,978
Shukaku, Gaara's Tailed Beast
known as...

2060
02:20:27,370 --> 02:20:28,371
The One-Tail!

2061
02:20:29,355 --> 02:20:33,443
The fiery Monster Cat of
the Hidden Cloud's Yugito Nii...

2062
02:20:34,757 --> 02:20:35,800
The Two-Tails!

2063
02:20:38,275 --> 02:20:40,819
The former Mizukage's...

2064
02:20:41,698 --> 02:20:43,158
Three-Tails!

2065
02:20:45,259 --> 02:20:47,428
Roshi of the Lava Style's...

2066
02:20:48,127 --> 02:20:49,336
Four-Tails!

2067
02:20:50,923 --> 02:20:52,758
Han of the Hidden Stone's...

2068
02:20:53,219 --> 02:20:54,346
Five-Tails!

2069
02:20:56,763 --> 02:20:58,848
The rogue ninja Utakata's...

2070
02:20:59,588 --> 02:21:00,839
Six-Tails!

2071
02:21:04,062 --> 02:21:06,064
Fuu of the Hidden Waterfall's...

2072
02:21:07,444 --> 02:21:08,737
Seven-Tails!

2073
02:21:09,814 --> 02:21:12,275
Raikage's younger brother,
Killer Bee's...

2074
02:21:13,516 --> 02:21:14,642
Eight-Tails!

2075
02:21:16,882 --> 02:21:18,592
And the fox spirit of the Hidden Leaf...

2076
02:21:19,693 --> 02:21:20,945
The Nine-Tails!

2077
02:21:23,464 --> 02:21:29,428
The Ten-Tails' chakra was simply
divided up into the nine Tailed Beasts,

2078
02:21:30,590 --> 02:21:33,218
by the Sage of the Six Paths.

2079
02:21:33,520 --> 02:21:35,438
I don't like where this story is headed.

2080
02:21:35,887 --> 02:21:38,890
Is that why the Akatsuki are
gathering the Tailed Beasts?

2081
02:21:39,594 --> 02:21:42,764
The Sage of the Six Paths
developed a certain ninjutsu

2082
02:21:43,186 --> 02:21:45,355
in order to protect the world
from the Ten-Tails.

2083
02:21:46,051 --> 02:21:49,346
Even today, that ninjutsu is still
being secretly passed down.

2084
02:21:49,579 --> 02:21:52,081
It is the Sealing jutsu process
for Jinchuriki.

2085
02:21:52,438 --> 02:21:56,776
Yes, the Sage of the Six Paths was
the Ten-Tails' Jinchuriki.

2086
02:21:57,287 --> 02:22:01,458
In order to suppress it,
he sealed the Ten-Tails within his body.

2087
02:22:02,643 --> 02:22:06,605
The Sage, who saved
a world terrorized by the Ten-Tails,

2088
02:22:06,979 --> 02:22:09,481
became a savior and won praise as a god.

2089
02:22:10,274 --> 02:22:14,366
But if the Sage died, the powerful
and demonic chakra of the Ten-Tails

2090
02:22:14,391 --> 02:22:18,000
would once again be released
unto the world.

2091
02:22:18,494 --> 02:22:20,913
Fearing this, at the time of his death,

2092
02:22:21,086 --> 02:22:23,714
the Sage of the Six Paths summoned
every last ounce of his power

2093
02:22:23,739 --> 02:22:25,912
to partition the Ten-Tails' chakra
into nine parts

2094
02:22:25,937 --> 02:22:27,897
and scattered them across the world.

2095
02:22:28,119 --> 02:22:32,040
Then he sealed the Ten-Tails' body,
now devoid of chakra,

2096
02:22:32,167 --> 02:22:35,003
and hurled it into the sky.

2097
02:22:36,206 --> 02:22:38,124
And it became the moon.

2098
02:22:38,917 --> 02:22:43,531
What a tall tale!
As if a human could do such a thing.

2099
02:22:44,540 --> 02:22:47,251
When he became
the Jinchuriki of the Ten-Tails,

2100
02:22:47,398 --> 02:22:49,943
the Sage of the Six Paths went
beyond the realm of humans.

2101
02:22:50,258 --> 02:22:54,335
I understand now that
you seek that inhuman power

2102
02:22:54,360 --> 02:23:00,229
by gathering the chakra of the nine,
namely all, of the Tailed Beasts.

2103
02:23:00,598 --> 02:23:03,945
But what will you do with all that power?

2104
02:23:04,546 --> 02:23:06,089
Revive the Ten-Tails.

2105
02:23:06,850 --> 02:23:09,478
And I will become
the Ten-Tails' Jinchuriki.

2106
02:23:10,409 --> 02:23:14,121
I will use its power to strengthen
my ocular powers,

2107
02:23:14,310 --> 02:23:16,687
and activate a certain jutsu.

2108
02:23:16,970 --> 02:23:20,181
A certain jutsu?! What is it?

2109
02:23:20,658 --> 02:23:22,494
What do you intend to do?

2110
02:23:22,705 --> 02:23:26,292
A massive genjutsu,
where I project my eyes upon the moon.

2111
02:23:26,748 --> 02:23:28,500
Infinite Tsukuyomi.

2112
02:23:29,978 --> 02:23:33,398
I will cast a genjutsu on every human
that walks the earth.

2113
02:23:33,880 --> 02:23:40,053
And in that genjutsu, I will control
all humans and unify the world.

2114
02:23:41,383 --> 02:23:44,052
A world without hatred or war.

2115
02:23:44,226 --> 02:23:47,938
Everything will become one with me,
everything will be united.

2116
02:23:49,910 --> 02:23:52,484
That is my Project Tsuki no Me.

2117
02:23:52,763 --> 02:23:56,080
Stop joking around!
I'm not handing the world over to you!

2118
02:23:56,384 --> 02:23:58,636
Peace that exists only as
an illusion is deception.

2119
02:23:59,072 --> 02:24:01,991
Peace is only meaningful when it is
genuinely achieved in the real world.

2120
02:24:02,470 --> 02:24:04,847
So what exists inside such a world?

2121
02:24:05,082 --> 02:24:08,043
There is no hope, no dreams!
It's just an escape!

2122
02:24:08,483 --> 02:24:10,568
Unite the world, huh?

2123
02:24:11,245 --> 02:24:14,540
Danzo mentioned something similar.

2124
02:24:14,955 --> 02:24:17,999
But instead of uniting the world,

2125
02:24:18,147 --> 02:24:21,442
it just sounds like you want to
make the world yours!

2126
02:24:23,848 --> 02:24:27,101
All this talk and yet,
what have you Five Kage accomplished?

2127
02:24:27,907 --> 02:24:30,910
You of all people should know by now...

2128
02:24:34,628 --> 02:24:36,088
There is no such thing as hope!

2129
02:24:37,868 --> 02:24:40,412
To hope is equivalent to giving up,

2130
02:24:40,715 --> 02:24:43,342
and it's the biggest deception of all.

2131
02:24:43,978 --> 02:24:46,400
Turn over the remaining beasts,
Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails,

2132
02:24:46,425 --> 02:24:48,886
and cooperate with my plan.

2133
02:24:49,124 --> 02:24:51,251
Or there will be war.

2134
02:24:51,873 --> 02:24:53,175
War you say?

2135
02:24:53,635 --> 02:24:56,032
The Eight-Tails?
What are you talking about?

2136
02:24:56,250 --> 02:24:57,835
Didn't you get Bee?

2137
02:24:58,943 --> 02:25:01,654
The attempt to capture
the Eight-Tails failed and he escaped.

2138
02:25:02,315 --> 02:25:05,152
He is a ninja who is a perfect Jinchuriki.

2139
02:25:05,941 --> 02:25:07,818
Only your younger brother
has got what it takes.

2140
02:25:07,843 --> 02:25:08,844
Huh?!

2141
02:25:10,690 --> 02:25:13,276
Yeah, I sort of had a feeling about that.

2142
02:25:15,554 --> 02:25:17,222
That idiot!

2143
02:25:17,351 --> 02:25:19,781
He used that chance to slip away and now,
he's having the time of his life!

2144
02:25:19,806 --> 02:25:22,797
Unforgivable!
He's going to get my Iron Claw!

2145
02:25:23,335 --> 02:25:25,462
We will not hand over Naruto Uzumaki.

2146
02:25:25,785 --> 02:25:27,120
I agree with him!

2147
02:25:28,021 --> 02:25:29,355
What about you, Raikage?

2148
02:25:29,704 --> 02:25:31,831
There's no way I'll let him have
my younger brother!

2149
02:25:32,703 --> 02:25:34,539
I don't have the strength,

2150
02:25:34,564 --> 02:25:37,400
but the Tailed Beasts
we've gathered so far, do.

2151
02:25:37,742 --> 02:25:39,494
You people have no chance of winning.

2152
02:25:39,960 --> 02:25:41,462
We haven't given up hope.

2153
02:25:41,989 --> 02:25:43,366
Very well.

2154
02:25:44,202 --> 02:25:48,414
I hereby declare the
Fourth Great Ninja War.

2155
02:25:49,026 --> 02:25:51,278
The Fourth Great Ninja War?

2156
02:25:52,026 --> 02:25:53,445
Are you mad?!

2157
02:25:58,908 --> 02:26:01,536
The next time we meet will be
on the battlefield.
