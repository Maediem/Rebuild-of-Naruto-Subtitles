1
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:37,037
I'm beginning to lose my patience
with these shinobi.

2
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:43,877
How long do they intend to keep
us feudal lords cooped up like this?

3
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,088
Now, now...
What is the harm?

4
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:50,925
We should decorate them
after the war.

5
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:56,848
What shall we call it?

6
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,733
<i>Is this it?</i>

7
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,362
How hard the wind blows

8
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:14,501
As we course through
the deep and winding road

9
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:18,453
The smell of the wind reminds me
of the capital...

10
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:26,377
Officials and we feudal lords are used
as hostages in times of war.

11
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:30,590
It is the duty of the shinobi to
guarantee our safety.

12
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:35,470
Which is why I accompany you,
Lord of the Land of Mist.

13
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,933
We will reach
your hiding place shortly.

14
00:01:44,825 --> 00:01:48,579
Now then, what is a suitable title
for the decoration?

15
00:01:48,812 --> 00:01:51,482
Certificate of... Certificate of...

16
00:01:58,212 --> 00:02:00,131
Is that the enemy?!
I didn't detect anything!

17
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,789
Do not let them get close
to the Feudal Lords!

18
00:02:13,382 --> 00:02:14,591
He fell for it!

19
00:02:21,281 --> 00:02:23,825
<i>So, this wasn't it.</i>

20
00:02:25,338 --> 00:02:27,132
Damn! He got away.

21
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,858
Get word to the other hiding place! Stat!

22
00:02:30,952 --> 00:02:32,245
Oh!

23
00:02:32,354 --> 00:02:35,649
I have the perfect name
for the honor!

24
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:41,744
Land of Fire's Hidden Leaf,
Land of Wind's Hidden Sand,

25
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:47,876
Land of Earth's Hidden Stone,
Land of Water's Hidden Mist,

26
00:02:48,048 --> 00:02:54,930
Land of Lightning's Hidden Cloud
Allied Shinobi Decoration!

27
00:02:55,237 --> 00:02:56,551
It's too long!

28
00:02:56,693 --> 00:03:00,363
The Allied Award will suffice!

29
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,932
No, that is much too short.

30
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,185
It doesn't sound distinctive enough.

31
00:03:05,663 --> 00:03:08,146
Feudal lords are so carefree.

32
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,858
What's the fuss over
getting a decoration?

33
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:14,068
That's their job.

34
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,779
Don't knock it.

35
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,007
If there weren't any medals
and decorations,

36
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,201
we wouldn't know what honor is.

37
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,121
Someone has to set the standard.

38
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:28,917
Well... I guess so.

39
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,838
You don't get decorated
by just thinking about it!

40
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,716
Stay alert. It's almost time to move.

41
00:03:40,278 --> 00:03:42,113
Feudal Lord of the Land of Frost...

42
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:45,683
We are now headed for
the fifth hiding place.

43
00:03:46,322 --> 00:03:47,907
Fifth?

44
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,021
Yes...

45
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,233
We will be moving you
at fixed intervals to five locations

46
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:57,445
to prevent the enemy
from finding you.

47
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,824
Your bodyguards are
all skilled shinobi too.

48
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,536
That is reassuring.

49
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,330
Yes...

50
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:20,046
<i>They've underestimated me,
Black Zetsu!</i>

51
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:42,323
<i>I am the land itself!</i>

52
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,876
Playing with those building blocks,

53
00:06:18,901 --> 00:06:21,254
it's only natural I completed it,
at my level now.

54
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,227
You're expected to do
that simple act...

55
00:06:24,252 --> 00:06:26,630
The next one won't be so easy,
that's a fact.

56
00:06:27,817 --> 00:06:32,113
Oh... So this connects to that room
where I struggle with Nine-Tails' chakra.

57
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,018
Take a good look.

58
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,188
This time,
it's a statue of the Eight-Tails.

59
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,023
This is a drag every time!

60
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:44,028
Here's the entrance to another room.

61
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,197
For the final Tailed Beast training!

62
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,658
Now stop complaining!

63
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:57,166
I'm going to teach you
the most powerful jutsu for a Jinchuriki.

64
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,837
What do you say?
Preparations okay?

65
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:04,507
Right! I have to know how
to control stuff.

66
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,176
So? What do I do first?

67
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,929
Transform into a Tailed Beast
in Tailed Beast mode!

68
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:13,975
That's step one.
Now it's your turn!

69
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,977
Hurry and get it done.

70
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,645
Isn't that dangerous?

71
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,064
Transforming into a Tailed Beast
is sorta scary.

72
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,110
You can do it now, fool, ya fool.

73
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:27,405
'Cuz you can draw out
pure Tailed Beast chakra.

74
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:30,074
It's not going to run wild, ya fool!

75
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,742
Well then...

76
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,791
Visualize your Tailed Beast, ya fool!

77
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,639
Can't, huh? Too bad.

78
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,045
Well, it's not like you're pals
with the Nine-Tails...

79
00:07:57,432 --> 00:07:59,642
Anyway, Tailed Beast Transformation
was a failure.

80
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,523
<i>So how are you going to teach him
the Tailed Beast Bomb?</i>

81
00:08:03,265 --> 00:08:05,418
<i>That's the first technique
a Jinchuriki can use</i>

82
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,904
<i>after going into Tailed Beast State, Bee.</i>

83
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,793
Man, I'm dead tired.

84
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:15,536
So I used the Nine-Tails' chakra
all for nothing?

85
00:08:16,197 --> 00:08:20,660
<i>By the way... shouldn't you tell him that
this Tailed Beast mode is risky?</i>

86
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,672
<i>Bee, the risk for you and Naruto
is fundamentally different.</i>

87
00:08:24,954 --> 00:08:28,041
<i>Look, I'll explain. Let me out.</i>

88
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,052
I hand over the baton
for the mumble jumble

89
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,179
Saves me from the verbal fumble...

90
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,388
<i>Hey! Naruto!</i>

91
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,807
<i>I'm the Eight-Tails, not Bee.</i>

92
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,060
<i>Now listen carefully
to what I tell you!</i>

93
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,562
Man, this is so complicated.

94
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:45,149
But you don't talk in rhymes,
so it's easier to understand.

95
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:49,737
<i>First, I'll go over the risk when you
switch to Tailed Beast chakra mode.</i>

96
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,072
Risk?

97
00:08:52,022 --> 00:08:53,565
There's a risk to this mode?!

98
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,368
<i>Big time!</i>

99
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,995
<i>It's very important,
so be quiet and listen.</i>

100
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,039
Y-Yeah...

101
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,002
<i>The risk when you switch to
Tailed Beast chakra mode...</i>

102
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,087
<i>That's...!</i>

103
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,255
Yes?

104
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:11,300
<i>Basically, when you're in
Tailed Beast chakra mode,</i>

105
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,221
<i>your own personal Naruto chakra is
being taken by the Nine-Tails!</i>

106
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,182
<i>Because you momentarily
shelve your own chakra</i>

107
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,184
<i>in order to use the Nine-Tails' chakra.</i>

108
00:09:21,598 --> 00:09:27,149
<i>So of course, if your own chakra is
emptied out completely... you're a goner.</i>

109
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,458
Huh?! But how come
Mr. Eight-Tails is okay?!

110
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,741
<i>Even if you take over
the Nine-Tails' chakra,</i>

111
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,578
<i>you haven't really tamed him.</i>

112
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,038
<i>Bee and I were like that in the past.</i>

113
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,583
<i>We fought over each other's chakra.</i>

114
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,003
<i>Oh and, you shouldn't
use Shadow Clones</i>

115
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:49,088
<i>when you're in
Tailed Beast chakra mode.</i>

116
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,175
<i>Shadow Clones made from
your own chakra will be taken.</i>

117
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,970
<i>They'll be gone in an instant,
and you'll die.</i>

118
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,267
But my chakra takes the Nine-Tails' chakra
that's been leaking

119
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:04,228
and reconstitutes it or whatever...
so I have lots.

120
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:07,356
<i>Fool! Don't underestimate
the Nine-Tails!</i>

121
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,026
<i>He'll wipe out your chakra!</i>

122
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:14,905
<i>Restoring your stolen
chakra takes time!</i>

123
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,032
<i>So be careful!</i>

124
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,910
<i>If you get carried away and
use only the Nine-Tails' chakra in battle,</i>

125
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,912
<i>you'll end up dead.</i>

126
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:22,913
Wh-What...?

127
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:28,002
<i>By rights, you and the Tailed Beast should
negotiate how you both use chakra.</i>

128
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:31,088
<i>But Nine-Tails isn't the type to do that.</i>

129
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:37,720
<i>Also, there's a limit to the chakra
you managed to tug out of the Nine-Tails.</i>

130
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,639
So much risk...

131
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,768
And yet, I can't use
a Jinchuriki's ultimate jutsu?

132
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,896
<i>Well, forget about
the Tailed Beast Bomb.</i>

133
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:50,608
<i>You should just concentrate on
polishing up your special moves.</i>

134
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:54,278
Tailed Beast Bomb?
What kind of jutsu is that?

135
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,197
<i>Oh, it's simple.</i>

136
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:59,158
<i>You take your chakra and
change its form...</i>

137
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,369
<i>gather it up and compress it...</i>

138
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,496
<i>Then just spew it out.</i>

139
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,086
<i>Like that time...</i>

140
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,091
<i>It's almost like vomiting.</i>

141
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,681
I want to try it in this mode!

142
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,558
<i>Like this?!</i>

143
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,022
<i>It's impossible without
Tailed Beast Transformation.</i>

144
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,941
<i>Anyway, I've explained it all to you.</i>

145
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,276
<i>I'm going to switch with Bee.</i>

146
00:11:34,854 --> 00:11:37,106
Oh well, too bad.
It can't be helped.

147
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:43,536
You just have to do your special move
in Tailed Beast chakra mode, is all...

148
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:48,833
Rasengan requires Shadow Clone Jutsu,
so it's not suited to this mode.

149
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,794
chakra release and rotation...

150
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,963
plus change in chakra form
and compression...

151
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,715
That's a two-person move.

152
00:11:56,128 --> 00:11:57,105
Tailed Beast chakra...

153
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,284
Your own hands and feet,
that's the sensation.

154
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,054
And the real ones, are just an illusion.

155
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,222
I see...

156
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,851
Maybe like this?

157
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,853
Not bad at all.

158
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:12,898
Try that special move of yours.
That move you already have.

159
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:14,859
All right!

160
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,652
<i>Rasengan!</i>

161
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,367
Huh?!

162
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,119
This is...!

163
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:28,164
Change in chakra form with
rotation and compression...

164
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,417
<i>That jutsu!</i>

165
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,329
<i>It's exactly like the Tailed Beast Bomb,
fool, ya fool!</i>

166
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,591
Hey! Naruto!

167
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:42,178
Who taught you that jutsu,
ya dimwit?!

168
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:45,306
Huh?! Well, it was Pervy Sage...

169
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,800
I mean, Jiraiya-sensei.

170
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,897
But the Fourth Hokage invented it.

171
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,192
<i>Fourth Hokage...?</i>

172
00:12:56,217 --> 00:12:58,758
<i>What a coincidence.
Or maybe fate?</i>

173
00:12:58,783 --> 00:13:00,034
<i>Truly not a shame!</i>

174
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,572
Rasengan!

175
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,200
The method is exactly the same
as Tailed Beast Bomb.

176
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,618
It's exactly the same!

177
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:08,829
Created with
the Tailed Beast Bomb in mind!

178
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,373
That's the Rasengan!

179
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,544
It's like he entrusted you with
the Tailed Beast Bomb.

180
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,921
You couldn't have been luckier.

181
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,841
It's easy when you're in
Tailed Beast mode.

182
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:24,804
change in chakra form as
a human is impossible.

183
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:28,933
If you add rotation,
it makes it possible.

184
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,060
Yeah, but...

185
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:34,104
I can't do it as well as
my usual Rasengan.

186
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:37,191
Tailed Beast chakra is
a combination of

187
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:40,194
positive blue chakra and
negative red chakra.

188
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,821
Their ratio is key.

189
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:58,254
During compression, if you change
the red-to-blue ratio to 2:8,

190
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:59,588
it will become a ball!

191
00:14:01,072 --> 00:14:02,073
Try it!

192
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:03,592
Okay!

193
00:14:14,819 --> 00:14:16,988
You haven't got it yet.

194
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:20,734
Your red is at 9.5 and blue is 0.5!

195
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:23,195
It looks easy, but it's hard.

196
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,115
All of a sudden,
there's talk of positive and negative,

197
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,992
red and blue chakra, and numbers...

198
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,035
I don't understand this stuff!

199
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,799
Besides, this Rasengan is heavy.

200
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:35,933
I have to use both hands
or it'll break apart.

201
00:14:36,158 --> 00:14:38,994
I can't be bothered with
all those details.

202
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,298
I'm the type that learns
by doing things.

203
00:14:43,054 --> 00:14:45,317
So as for this Tailed Beast Rasengan,

204
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:48,721
I'm going to keep doing it
and doing it...

205
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,055
Until I get it right!

206
00:14:53,137 --> 00:14:56,437
It's impossible in human form...
it's too much toil.

207
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,897
Rest a bit.

208
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,357
The wounds on your hands
come from the jutsu's recoil.

209
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:04,111
I told you, I can't worry
about the details.

210
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,784
Octopops, you said the ratio
should be 8:2.

211
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,037
Keep watching me and
tell me when I get it...

212
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,456
I want to remember
what that feels like!

213
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,374
You sure are a persistent guy.

214
00:15:17,493 --> 00:15:20,955
Very well.
I take back what I said.

215
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:29,678
That's all.

216
00:15:34,408 --> 00:15:35,809
It's a message from Headquarters.

217
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,630
Our Commando Unit has skirmished
with the enemy's Commando Unit.

218
00:15:40,377 --> 00:15:42,428
Our predictions about
the enemy were correct.

219
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,568
But they are raising the dead
with a jutsu

220
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,321
known as the Reanimation Jutsu and
sending them onto the battlefield.

221
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:51,617
Who knows what kind of shinobi
we'll see on the battlefield.

222
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,661
So everyone, be prepared.

223
00:15:56,404 --> 00:15:57,489
That's the signal.

224
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,292
The enemy is near.

225
00:16:01,087 --> 00:16:04,338
But there's no word from Headquarters
that they detected the enemy.

226
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:05,714
What's going on?

227
00:16:06,493 --> 00:16:09,301
It probably means there are enemies
that even Headquarters cannot sense.

228
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:15,099
After all, the enemy will only
revive the strong ones.

229
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,268
We have to fight dead people?

230
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,897
What do I do?
I'm getting scared.

231
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:26,651
Hey Choji, now that you're here
it's too late to whine.

232
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,365
We just received word from
Captain Gaara's Fourth Company.

233
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,200
Four of the enemies have
been spotted.

234
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,286
They are the Second Mizukage,
the Second Tsuchikage,

235
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,621
the Fourth Kazekage and...

236
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,793
And who's the other?!

237
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,256
The Third Raikage.

238
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,757
What?!

239
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:49,925
My old man too?!

240
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,095
Damn the Akatsuki!

241
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,599
The numbers don't match up with
our own sensory readings.

242
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,977
Are you sure this data is accurate?

243
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:01,979
Princess Tsunade...

244
00:17:03,617 --> 00:17:06,108
It's the Second Tsuchikage
that has appeared.

245
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,401
Huh?!

246
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:12,656
It's no wonder we
could sense three,

247
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,117
but couldn't detect one.

248
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:22,750
The reason sensory detection
was futile is the doing of Lord Mu.

249
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,089
<i>There's someone who
can evade detection</i>

250
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,091
<i>from even the Headquarter's
Sensory Division?!</i>

251
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,260
<i>What is he?</i>

252
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,012
Captain Ao!

253
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,556
There are far too many
of those white monsters.

254
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,726
It's impossible for me to detect
the ones with special characteristics.

255
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:46,440
Darui's First Company will soon
encounter several thousand enemy troops!

256
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,402
Please distinguish the white ones
from those under the Reanimation Jutsu!

257
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:52,654
All right!

258
00:17:52,961 --> 00:17:54,837
You take charge of
the broad-range scan!

259
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,041
Huh?!

260
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,417
This is not good!

261
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,503
Darui's First Company will
be facing too many

262
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,129
who are under the Reanimation Jutsu!

263
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,270
What's more,
they're all powerful shinobi!

264
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:36,907
They're coming.

265
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,368
Give the signal to get
into position for battle.

266
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:40,410
Right.

267
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,620
Right.

268
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,956
There are so many...

269
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,542
It's not just their numbers.

270
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,002
Headquarters was right.

271
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,047
I can distinguish the adept ones
with my Byakugan.

272
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:59,254
Lord Hiashi!
Look at your 10 o'clock.

273
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,475
Th-That's...

274
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:13,569
N-No way. That can't be...

275
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:14,903
What's wrong?

276
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,572
What about them?

277
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,158
That's...

278
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,702
They're... Lords Kinkaku and Ginkaku...

279
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,125
What?! These two are bathed
in the Nine-Tails' chakra!

280
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,918
Incredible chakra!

281
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,172
There's no doubt!

282
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,924
They are the Gold and Silver
Brothers of the Hidden Cloud.

283
00:19:36,613 --> 00:19:37,614
What?

284
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:42,764
<i>Even Dan is among them?</i>

285
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,437
The Fourth Company is
facing my old man.

286
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,231
And the First Company is looking
at Kinkaku and Ginkaku.

287
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:55,319
Now that it's come to this, I have
no choice but to go out there myself.

288
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,820
Please wait...

289
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:00,908
Lord Raikage...

290
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,285
You are the Supreme Commander
of the Allied Shinobi Forces!

291
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,622
The Supreme Commander must
remain safe in order to give orders

292
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,874
to the troops until
the final stages of the war.

293
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,544
That is your duty towards
your forces.

294
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:17,257
But an enemy force
of enormous strength

295
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,259
is converging
on Darui's First Company!

296
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,804
The tide of battle is
like a living thing.

297
00:20:23,374 --> 00:20:24,876
It changes second by second.

298
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:28,101
To discern those changes
is why I am here!

299
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,604
Bring me the map!

300
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:34,316
First, let us verify
every company's status.

301
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:41,492
At the forefront...
There's Kankuro Commando Unit.

302
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,787
It seems they have skirmished with

303
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,790
a Commando Unit of reanimated shinobi.

304
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,124
However, they defeated the enemy!

305
00:20:51,658 --> 00:20:54,828
Presently, they are moving forward
towards the Akatsuki hideout.

306
00:20:56,327 --> 00:20:59,610
Among the combat battalions,

307
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,552
Kakashi's Third Company
is leading the charge.

308
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,138
They are in the midst of battle now,

309
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,724
but they have taken
the advantage.

310
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,065
Right now, the main battle
is being waged here

311
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,526
by Kitsuchi's Second Company.

312
00:21:22,393 --> 00:21:29,287
And Mifune's Fifth Company is the
reserve unit standing by to assist.

313
00:21:30,337 --> 00:21:32,624
Now then, it begins right here.

314
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,547
The enemy unit that came by sea.

315
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:42,175
Darui's First Company
will take them on.

316
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,972
Let's call this Battlefield A.

317
00:21:48,152 --> 00:21:53,854
And facing the previous Kage
who suddenly appeared...

318
00:21:54,404 --> 00:21:57,032
is Gaara's Fourth Company.

319
00:21:58,385 --> 00:22:00,471
We'll call this Battlefield B.

320
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:09,619
When you look at it like this, we
seem to be evenly matched in strength.

321
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,706
It's unwise to think that.

322
00:22:15,524 --> 00:22:18,027
The ironclad rule of warfare is
to take the advantage

323
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,755
by mobilizing troops!

324
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,119
The enemy advances
from two directions.

325
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:29,639
You counter that by attacking from
one direction with full force.

326
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,812
We have two battlefields:

327
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,397
A and B...

328
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:43,195
First, we must deal with A.

329
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:46,362
We will concentrate our troops
with Darui's First Company.

330
00:22:48,046 --> 00:22:50,715
So, we will deploy
Mifune's Fifth Company

331
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:55,457
in belt formation as support to
reinforce the ranks from the rear.

332
00:22:57,116 --> 00:23:00,370
Then we will move Kitsuchi's
Second Company to the side

333
00:23:00,395 --> 00:23:02,898
and pin the enemy against the sea.

334
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,928
Kitsuchi's Second Company
may be stretched thin.

335
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:11,598
But, the Fifth Company's deployment
in belt formation

336
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,766
will serve as a barrier.

337
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:17,396
Meanwhile, Gaara's Fourth Company
will break up and

338
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:20,690
make a slow retreat to
the opposite side of the village

339
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,609
as if to lure the enemy.

340
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,613
From there, half of the company
will join up

341
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,616
with Darui's First Company
as reinforcements.

342
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:40,710
And after the enemy is crushed
in Battlefield A,

343
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:46,425
Darui's First Company and
Gaara's squads will turn back

344
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,093
towards Battlefield B...

345
00:23:49,249 --> 00:23:52,835
and the enemy that Gaara's
Fourth Company had kept occupied

346
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,891
will be crushed from the rear
all at once.

347
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,272
Why start with Battlefield A?

348
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,984
If you split
Gaara's Fourth Company into two,

349
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:08,864
won't the enemy seize that
opportunity to attack?

350
00:24:10,721 --> 00:24:12,639
Don't underestimate those four.

351
00:24:13,281 --> 00:24:15,534
They are former Kage!

352
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:21,376
With Battlefield A, Companies Two
and Five are in proximity

353
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,503
to Battlefield A and
can move quickly.

354
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:27,048
Also, Kitsuchi's Second Company
has engaged the white ones before

355
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,592
and is familiar with them.

356
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,635
Attacking the white clones
from the rear

357
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:32,304
will ensure a high rate of success.

358
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,599
As for the enemy in Battlefield B...

359
00:24:36,002 --> 00:24:38,588
The former Kage cannot
launch an attack.

360
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,400
If the troops suddenly
break off into two,

361
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:49,196
the enemy will assume we're up
to something and will not charge.

362
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:57,287
The battle-hardened former Kage will
not be so foolish as to attack...

363
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,080
I see.

364
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:03,293
And even if they were to attack,

365
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,213
Gaara's Fourth Company is
a long-range battle unit.

366
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,882
They specialize in fighting from
a distance, which means

367
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:12,135
it would take longer to engage them
in a short-distance battle.

368
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:15,305
In other words, it is a company
that could buy us time.

369
00:25:18,408 --> 00:25:20,720
What will you do,
Supreme Commander?

370
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:26,691
No wonder we could not
take down the Leaf.

371
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,487
You are blessed with
fine shinobi, Tsunade.

372
00:25:31,195 --> 00:25:33,447
Save the compliments
for after the war.

373
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,326
So? What will you do?

374
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,997
All right! Let's do it!

375
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:44,751
Inoichi,
you've been listening, right?

376
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,645
I'm already on it. Also...

377
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:51,091
We've already sent word to Mifune
about the Commando Unit.

378
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,551
They are on their way.

379
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:57,472
And Shizune is allocating her people
evenly to provide medical attention.

380
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,350
All companies have been notified!

381
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:13,863
All right, it's been a while since
Ino-Shika-Cho went into action!

382
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,911
I have one question,
Nara from the Hidden Leaf.

383
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,538
What is it?

384
00:26:22,405 --> 00:26:25,116
In order for your strategy
to be foolproof,

385
00:26:25,141 --> 00:26:27,894
you must add in one thing.

386
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,879
Which is?

387
00:26:30,953 --> 00:26:33,831
The Second Tsuchikage is
no ordinary shinobi.

388
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:37,304
The only one who can stop him
is the old Fence-Sitter.

389
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:41,808
His name has come up often
in our discussions.

390
00:26:42,241 --> 00:26:43,576
What kind of shinobi is he?

391
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:47,147
From the time I heard that
his chakra could not be detected,

392
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:49,399
I knew he would be a problem.

393
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,242
He has an advance form of 
Kekkei Genkai...

394
00:26:52,267 --> 00:26:54,644
He is known as a Kekkei Tota shinobi...

395
00:26:55,222 --> 00:26:56,431
Kekkei Tota?!

396
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:01,620
I thought you, Third Tsuchikage,
were the only one...

397
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,164
The Second Tsuchikage too?

398
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:07,917
The ability to activate
the three chakra natures

399
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,919
of wind, earth and fire,
all at once.

400
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:13,882
He was my teacher
who taught me the Particle Style.

401
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:19,554
To have to battle my master
at this age...

402
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,849
It does not pay
to live a long life.

403
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,019
Will you go?

404
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:27,729
Yes.

405
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:29,439
What choice do I have?

406
00:27:30,979 --> 00:27:32,230
Nara...

407
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:33,735
Yes?

408
00:27:34,244 --> 00:27:38,498
I'm not going just because Lord Mu
of the Particle Style is there.

409
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:42,329
Your tactical plan is brilliant.

410
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,917
And while all the resurrected Kage

411
00:27:45,942 --> 00:27:49,237
who stand before
the Fourth Company know war,

412
00:27:49,283 --> 00:27:51,202
they will not make
unnecessary moves.

413
00:27:52,008 --> 00:27:55,178
You are probably right in
your battle assessment.

414
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:01,763
But the opposite is also possible.

415
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:06,451
The one who united
the Allied Forces is Gaara.

416
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:10,772
His youthful passion was
the primary catalyst.

417
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:15,068
Are you saying this could have
the opposite effect on the battlefield?

418
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,614
I appreciate your insight.

419
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:24,494
Well then, I guess it's time
to leap into the war

420
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:28,373
and show these young brats
what fighting is all about.

421
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,377
Especially that brazen young kid.

422
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,144
How dull...

423
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:53,606
But I'll show them why
I'm the one guarding the coastline.

424
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,989
I'll launch the opening shot!
Then continue!

425
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,699
– Yes sir!
– Yes sir!

426
00:29:04,094 --> 00:29:06,327
<i>Lightning Style: Black Panther!</i>

427
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,671
Black Lightning!

428
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,840
Captain Darui is
the only one authorized

429
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,551
by the previous Raikage
to inherit the Black Lightning!

430
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:23,470
Sorry about that.

431
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:32,812
Up above!

432
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,150
We're not going to allow you
to pass so easily!

433
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,948
Keep on going!

434
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,630
Don't let them break
through the barricade!

435
00:29:58,963 --> 00:29:59,964
Now go!

436
00:30:07,808 --> 00:30:09,101
Choza...

437
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:10,809
What?

438
00:30:14,075 --> 00:30:15,076
I see...

439
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,899
You're all grown up, Choza.

440
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:22,195
I still have a lot to grow.

441
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,072
Release!

442
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,826
<i>Eight Trigrams Palm Rotation!</i>

443
00:30:38,942 --> 00:30:39,943
Brother...

444
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,297
Forgive me...

445
00:30:42,518 --> 00:30:45,479
I am a member of the branch family,
sworn to protect the main family,

446
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:47,881
I'm standing here now as your enemy.

447
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:51,891
This must be my punishment for
resenting the main family long ago.

448
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,799
My body will not do
what I tell it to.

449
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,899
As it is, my decision
to choose death

450
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:03,236
for the sake of the village
has been undone...

451
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:08,182
This is the fate in store for me,
a member of the branch family.

452
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:10,910
There is no such fate!

453
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:14,914
Your son has fought
to demonstrate that!

454
00:31:15,503 --> 00:31:17,338
So has my daughter!

455
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,210
<i>Neji...</i>

456
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,795
<i>And Lady Hinata too...</i>

457
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,802
Damn, there's no end to this!

458
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,065
Are you all right, Neji?!

459
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,318
Yeah... Thanks, Hinata.

460
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:49,741
It's not about the branch family protecting
the bloodline of the main family anymore.

461
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:52,118
We protect each other as comrades!

462
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,915
That time has actually come to pass?

463
00:31:58,557 --> 00:32:00,225
Then Brother...

464
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:04,172
This is all the more reason,
by your hand I wish to...

465
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:19,687
Hey!

466
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,940
All this moving around
is making me sick!

467
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:24,525
Talk about being artless, hmm!

468
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:26,602
Shut up.

469
00:32:26,771 --> 00:32:29,524
I'll be happy to seal
that mouth shut too.

470
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,658
I'm not into tight spaces!

471
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,911
I'll show you what real art is,
so let me outta here, hmm!

472
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,039
Damn it...

473
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,253
Ouch!

474
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,799
<i>We stopped... hmm.</i>

475
00:32:49,619 --> 00:32:50,959
Granny Chiyo...

476
00:32:53,026 --> 00:32:54,027
And...

477
00:32:57,266 --> 00:33:00,019
Well done, Kankuro.

478
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:03,147
You seem to have stopped Sasori.

479
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:06,025
Hmm? That voice...

480
00:33:07,132 --> 00:33:11,053
Hey! If you're here to help,
get me out of here!

481
00:33:11,465 --> 00:33:15,009
It's stifling me and
I'm about to explode, hmm!

482
00:33:15,211 --> 00:33:17,005
No, you're wrong.

483
00:33:17,322 --> 00:33:20,784
You can't explode,
that's the reason you're in there...

484
00:33:21,183 --> 00:33:22,977
Explosive Style kid.

485
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,879
Oh... well, that's true.

486
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:29,841
Hey, don't put it like that, hmm!

487
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:36,639
Both the Akatsuki and the shinobi of
the Five Great Nations are enemies to me.

488
00:33:37,025 --> 00:33:39,611
I have no intention of helping you.

489
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:43,479
I loathe this jutsu.

490
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,898
I have no control over my body.

491
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,525
Listen up.

492
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,444
Retreat on my signal.

493
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,029
Right.

494
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,166
We just got tactical orders
from Headquarters.

495
00:34:03,554 --> 00:34:05,269
We're to transmit this
to the front immediately!

496
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:08,463
Get the tactical data
to the captains!

497
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:15,928
Captain Kitsuchi!

498
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,374
This just came in from Headquarters!
Tactical orders!

499
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,641
All right! Tell me!

500
00:34:22,873 --> 00:34:23,958
Got it.

501
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:29,369
Sorry, I just got orders to
take half this company

502
00:34:29,394 --> 00:34:31,563
and join up with
the First Company.

503
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,738
Half?!

504
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,698
Are they out of their minds
at Headquarters?!

505
00:34:36,101 --> 00:34:39,062
No, I agree with their strategy.

506
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,996
If everything goes according to plan,
things will be okay.

507
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,248
And I'll be back.

508
00:34:47,865 --> 00:34:51,119
You didn't have to bother
stepping up to help.

509
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,176
And who was it that didn't stop me?

510
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:59,097
<i>Then let me ask you this.</i>

511
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:04,102
<i>When did you all
forsake yourselves?</i>

512
00:35:15,557 --> 00:35:19,603
This is where I take back
my forsaken self!!

513
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,749
<i>Super-Expansion Jutsu!</i>

514
00:36:03,616 --> 00:36:05,451
It's no use!
We can't lose them.

515
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,748
Tango! Get HQ!

516
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,797
The Commando Unit,
attempting to retreat, is reporting

517
00:36:14,905 --> 00:36:17,991
that the enemy pursuit team
is closing in.

518
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:21,512
A relief team from Fifth Company
has been dispatched.

519
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:25,725
Give them the coordinates of
the closest rendezvous point.

520
00:36:27,589 --> 00:36:29,591
I said let me outta here, hmm!

521
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,943
<i>Lord Orochimaru's chakra
is penetrating my skull</i>

522
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,486
<i>and coursing throughout my body.</i>

523
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,363
<i>I must succeed in my mission.</i>

524
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:41,532
Over that way...

525
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:45,286
Whether it was Akatsuki
or Orochimaru...

526
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:48,664
Whoever revived me will regret it!

527
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:52,293
Everyone is going to think
I was playing possum again!

528
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:54,045
How embarrassing is that?!

529
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:57,298
I'm trying to focus.
Can you shut up, puppet granny?

530
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:00,718
You shut up, Scuba-face!

531
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:04,138
Just a little more.

532
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,807
This is close enough.

533
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,434
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

534
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:09,685
Wha—?!

535
00:37:12,538 --> 00:37:13,622
Ibuse, do it!

536
00:37:16,552 --> 00:37:17,985
<i>Poison Fog!</i>

537
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:21,739
What?!

538
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,798
<i>He resorted to the poison because
he was fed up with chasing us?!</i>

539
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:39,799
<i>Damn it!</i>

540
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:45,304
<i>I should be resistant to poison,
but my body's going numb.</i>

541
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:49,892
Are those reinforcements?!

542
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,644
Hey, I'm over here!

543
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,358
I've caught up to you.

544
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:00,820
Damn it!

545
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,492
Hanzo, I presume?

546
00:38:07,103 --> 00:38:09,689
I am Mifune, leader of the samurai.

547
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,747
I wish to challenge you!

548
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,291
We're saved.

549
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:14,875
Sorry we're late.

550
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,127
Are you all right?!

551
00:38:16,359 --> 00:38:18,737
Be careful. The enemy uses poison.

552
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:22,719
The masks we wear are
specially made for fighting ninja

553
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,844
and are impervious to poison.

554
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:25,870
Put it on!

555
00:38:25,895 --> 00:38:26,896
Thanks.

556
00:38:27,504 --> 00:38:28,505
They need antidotes!

557
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,600
Take the Commando Unit members
to the Medical Corps immediately!

558
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:33,853
Lord Mifune!

559
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,379
I don't need any help!

560
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:38,243
If you don't want to get hurt,
stay out of my way.

561
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,776
So you're Mifune.

562
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,695
Why do you side with the shinobi?

563
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,573
How can you call yourself samurai?

564
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:48,117
We do not serve the shinobi.

565
00:38:48,835 --> 00:38:53,482
The one master that we follow has
never changed since the olden days.

566
00:38:58,533 --> 00:38:59,742
It is peace!

567
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,005
Peace?!

568
00:39:01,794 --> 00:39:05,631
We pledge ourselves to peace,
and act upon that conviction!

569
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,390
Lady Chiyo!

570
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,893
I haven't been playing dead.

571
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,895
You understand, don't you, Kankuro?

572
00:39:16,477 --> 00:39:17,478
Uh... yes?

573
00:39:17,503 --> 00:39:18,838
Never mind that.

574
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:22,068
Hanzo controls a poison salamander!

575
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:25,905
I fought him many times
in the past.

576
00:39:26,416 --> 00:39:29,461
That's why I know the ingredients
to the antidote.

577
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,329
I am also aware that the salamander
takes five minutes

578
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,082
to produce and store up its poison.

579
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:39,752
<i>That old hag...
Rambling on about everything!</i>

580
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:42,237
Ibuse! Retreat for now!

581
00:39:49,225 --> 00:39:51,477
Even though I'm being manipulated,

582
00:39:51,502 --> 00:39:55,089
it seems I don't have to
fight them right now.

583
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:57,853
I am going.

584
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:02,733
Here he comes!

585
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:09,560
It's hard?!

586
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:22,378
You countered that nicely.

587
00:40:23,887 --> 00:40:28,808
You're not bad for a weakling
who preaches peace and neutrality.

588
00:40:30,741 --> 00:40:31,992
Don't look at me that way.

589
00:40:32,446 --> 00:40:34,114
I once sought peace myself.

590
00:40:34,295 --> 00:40:38,908
I wanted to unite the Five Great
Nations into one shinobi world.

591
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:43,357
But I realized right away that
such a thing was impossible.

592
00:40:43,624 --> 00:40:44,708
Realized?

593
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:48,737
Battle after battle after battle...

594
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:52,283
And all that's left at the end is death!

595
00:40:52,419 --> 00:40:54,129
"Dedicate yourselves to peace?!"

596
00:40:55,063 --> 00:41:00,318
You know better than anyone,
what happened to that samurai!

597
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,878
Many samurai have
become shinobi instead,

598
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:06,172
and your techniques have been
passed over to the shinobi.

599
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,091
Capture them!

600
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:12,803
Sorry, but my body is acting
on its own and running away.

601
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,598
Samurai no longer have
a role in this world!

602
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,884
They don't believe in peace,
are influenced only by money,

603
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:23,830
and their roles have been taken over
by ninja who wield powerful ninjutsu.

604
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,903
Those shinobi fight and die,
leaving nothing behind.

605
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:31,405
I am the same.

606
00:41:31,953 --> 00:41:33,432
You are wrong.

607
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:35,001
It's not about life or death.

608
00:41:35,654 --> 00:41:39,741
I don't care if I lose my life
in the pursuit of peace!

609
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,709
Having conviction is to stir
oneself into action!

610
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,378
Your conviction has been warped!

611
00:41:47,193 --> 00:41:48,611
According to the Samurai Way,

612
00:41:48,636 --> 00:41:53,349
people are the sword and
they can live on in memories...

613
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,638
like my Famed Blade Kurosawa.

614
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,475
Do not compare people to swords!

615
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,895
What can you possibly glean
from a lump of iron?

616
00:42:03,523 --> 00:42:05,900
Take your ritual of seppuku.

617
00:42:05,925 --> 00:42:11,263
Why do you samurai try
to throw away your life?

618
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:15,950
I repeat... conviction does not fade.

619
00:42:16,475 --> 00:42:18,102
Enough of this nonsense!

620
00:42:18,273 --> 00:42:22,569
I will get rid of you, samurai,
once and for all.

621
00:42:27,517 --> 00:42:30,895
I will not allow you to use ninjutsu
beyond this point!

622
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,095
The rumors were right.
You are indeed a master swordsman.

623
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:39,598
This is what they meant by
ninjutsu being useless on you.

624
00:42:41,124 --> 00:42:43,418
You didn't even give me time
to weave a sign.

625
00:42:43,796 --> 00:42:46,257
And that second attack with
my sickle and chain...

626
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:48,315
Even if one was familiar
with that move,

627
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,526
no one has ever countered it.

628
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:53,237
Long ago,
when I was still unknown,

629
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,823
you and I fought,

630
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:57,491
although you probably
do not remember.

631
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:59,868
Is that so?
Then why aren't you dead?

632
00:43:00,146 --> 00:43:02,941
You snapped my sword with
that sickle and chain,

633
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,290
and slashed my head.

634
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:07,251
But somehow I survived.

635
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:14,008
So you're that samurai...

636
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:16,260
You didn't die?

637
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,637
Well then, this time I will make
certain of it.

638
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:21,181
Unfortunately, that will not happen.

639
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,808
From that first blow,

640
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:27,771
I understood why someone
as strong as you was killed.

641
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:30,399
What?! What do you mean?

642
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:34,778
I'm amazed that a shinobi of
your caliber did not notice.

643
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:38,240
Don't you remember how you died?

644
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:50,294
<i>Who could bring me to this point?</i>

645
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:54,965
<i>Have you forgotten my face?</i>

646
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:56,383
<i>You are...</i>

647
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:57,801
<i>Yahiko of Akatsuki!</i>

648
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,428
<i>You are supposed to be dead.</i>

649
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,013
<i>What's going on?!</i>

650
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:04,350
<i>You conspired with Danzo
and betrayed us.</i>

651
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:07,603
<i>You now only think
of self-preservation.</i>

652
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:08,771
<i>You're trash.</i>

653
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:12,316
<i>I once respected you.</i>

654
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,653
<i>But, you have changed.</i>

655
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:17,279
<i>Just who are you?!</i>

656
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,406
<i>How can you be so strong?!</i>

657
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:26,455
<i>And you don't even understand
why you will lose.</i>

658
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:28,791
<i>Vanish, Hanzo!</i>

659
00:44:29,046 --> 00:44:30,172
<i>S-Stop...</i>

660
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,006
<i>What do they mean?</i>

661
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:39,218
<i>What am I missing?!</i>

662
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,354
Be bathed in venom and die!

663
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:53,023
I've had enough of your nonsense.

664
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,026
What?!

665
00:44:57,444 --> 00:45:00,155
A sword that is continuously
honed will gain renown

666
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:03,158
and will be passed on. And...

667
00:45:23,072 --> 00:45:26,740
Men who cling to their convictions
and defend them

668
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:31,520
become heroes whose stories
live on throughout the ages!

669
00:45:32,251 --> 00:45:33,252
How?!

670
00:45:33,277 --> 00:45:35,195
How were you able to cut me this time?!

671
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,875
<i>The blade is not stained at all.</i>

672
00:45:45,397 --> 00:45:47,608
<i>Is he that fast?!</i>

673
00:45:48,836 --> 00:45:52,048
You lost your conviction and
stopped honing your skills.

674
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:57,296
Your swordsmanship has
lost its edge!

675
00:45:57,713 --> 00:46:01,842
Your blade is dull,
dirtied by blood and rusted.

676
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,304
A dull blade is worthless!

677
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,765
People are like swords!

678
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:14,229
You did not remember me.

679
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:19,651
And you probably don't recall what
you said as you left me to die.

680
00:46:24,979 --> 00:46:26,397
It's salamander poison.

681
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:29,244
I smeared it on my sickle too.

682
00:46:29,872 --> 00:46:31,290
But do not fear.

683
00:46:31,315 --> 00:46:34,902
The poison will numb the pain
and you will die within two days.

684
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:40,297
Do you know why I am feared
as Hanzo the Salamander?

685
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,299
I shall tell you my secret.

686
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:44,510
Consider it a parting gift.

687
00:46:46,014 --> 00:46:50,018
In my village, there was
a venomous black salamander.

688
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:54,603
I was just a boy then,
but when it died,

689
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,772
its venom sac was implanted in me.

690
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:00,651
Right around here...

691
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:05,280
in order to turn me into a man
capable of producing poison.

692
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:10,244
I can poison people just
by breathing on them.

693
00:47:10,938 --> 00:47:13,267
From the time I was a child,
I was feared.

694
00:47:13,292 --> 00:47:17,880
So I was forced to breathe
through this mask.

695
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:23,215
Then why didn't you take off
your mask during our fight?

696
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,425
I've done that in the past.

697
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:28,387
But doing that has risks.

698
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:31,390
The mask serves another purpose.

699
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:33,433
It protects me as well.

700
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:37,187
If during battle, the venom sac
is cut and ruptured,

701
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:40,357
the poison would vaporize.

702
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:43,569
Even with my resistance,

703
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:49,616
my body could not counter the
powerful gas, and I would be paralyzed.

704
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:53,245
It wouldn't kill me, but it would give
my foe an opportunity to attack.

705
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:56,540
Against someone of your caliber,

706
00:47:56,623 --> 00:48:00,627
I must keep the mask on
to prevent that.

707
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:03,589
Although, my blade was indeed dull.

708
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,636
People are like swords...

709
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:14,308
Which means that I wasn't sharp.

710
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:17,511
I will tell you one thing.

711
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:21,315
Death is not the end.

712
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,611
Loss of conviction is the end.

713
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:30,198
That's why it's such a nuisance.

714
00:48:30,223 --> 00:48:33,635
It's hard to discern one's conviction
just by looking at them.

715
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:37,414
If you die here, it wasn't
because you weren't sharp.

716
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:41,627
Blame your comrades, who cowered
at the first mention of my name,

717
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:46,423
and gave up, leaving you to fight me.

718
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:48,800
<i>H-Hanzo the Salamander?!</i>

719
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,302
<i>R-Run!</i>

720
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:54,765
You used your body as
a shield to protect them.

721
00:48:59,938 --> 00:49:02,941
I shall spread word of your heroism.

722
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:05,859
Name yourself in exchange
for your life!

723
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,436
"As compensation for my death..."

724
00:49:09,201 --> 00:49:11,745
Promise me one thing.

725
00:49:12,657 --> 00:49:14,159
Say it.

726
00:49:15,274 --> 00:49:19,361
Leave my fellow samurai alone!

727
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:31,677
Here's the antidote.

728
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:39,142
I told you that it's hard to discern one's
conviction just by looking at them.

729
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:41,395
But it's possible by fighting them.

730
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:44,439
It's been a while since
I fought someone like you.

731
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:47,067
I will spare you this time.

732
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:53,198
Well, it's possible that you'll die,
even if you take the antidote.

733
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:58,453
It is difficult to see
one's convictions through.

734
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:02,457
I, too, have my own conviction.

735
00:50:05,818 --> 00:50:08,905
To bring peace to this world.

736
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,176
I'm going to use you as a test.

737
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,471
To see if you will die,
still embracing your convictions...

738
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,223
Or you end up surviving,

739
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:21,018
and abandoning those convictions
over time.

740
00:50:28,848 --> 00:50:30,975
You're the one who insisted
on testing me.

741
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,419
Have you really abandoned
your conviction?

742
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:45,150
Well, that's hard to tell just
by looking.

743
00:50:46,965 --> 00:50:49,885
There is a way to stop me,
even though I am immortal.

744
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:53,383
I believed I explained it
to you before, Mifune.

745
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:57,429
So step back and wait for
the opportunity to seal me.

746
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,598
I believe you are...

747
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:00,891
Lord Mifune!

748
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,267
His poison!

749
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:04,019
I'm fine.

750
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:06,354
I am resistant to this poison.

751
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:09,107
But that may not be
the case from here on.

752
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:13,403
Everyone, retreat with me
and get ready to seal him!

753
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,280
<i>Just as I thought.</i>

754
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,949
<i>He didn't survive the poisoning
for nothing.</i>

755
00:51:21,881 --> 00:51:24,008
We'll observe from here.

756
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:26,792
<i>Lord Hanzo...</i>

757
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:31,071
Mifune... I...

758
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:36,350
entrust you with my conviction!

759
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,183
Seppuku?!

760
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:44,601
By a shinobi?!

761
00:51:51,143 --> 00:51:53,895
<i>He's defied the orders in my tag!</i>

762
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,362
<i>Suicide?!</i>

763
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:58,949
<i>I have no choice but to erase
his consciousness completely.</i>

764
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:12,170
<i>Why isn't he moving?</i>

765
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:19,469
Hanzo would never take orders from
one who hides behind the shadows,

766
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:24,266
manipulating others like puppets.

767
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:28,228
You put your life on the line and
regained your conviction.

768
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:31,189
My friend, you were no dull blade.

769
00:52:32,243 --> 00:52:33,160
Seal him!

770
00:52:33,185 --> 00:52:34,186
Yes!

771
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,249
They sealed him.

772
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,721
I shall spread word of your heroism.

773
00:53:03,076 --> 00:53:05,537
I hereby witness
your unwavering conviction.

774
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:08,852
Lord Hanzo,
you were admirable indeed!

775
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,191
Lord Mifune?

776
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:18,320
I understand Hanzo
did not have a grave.

777
00:53:20,124 --> 00:53:24,211
I must find someplace suitable
for him.

778
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,632
This is pitiful...

779
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:42,219
That we're caught in the jutsu
of the Second Hokage

780
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:46,514
whom we've beaten before...
eh, Kinkaku?

781
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:51,770
My apologies for embarrassing you,
Kinkaku and Ginkaku,

782
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:54,856
long revered as
the shining light of the Cloud.

783
00:53:56,779 --> 00:54:00,783
Ginkaku, look at his left shoulder.

784
00:54:03,612 --> 00:54:06,656
It's the kid who inherited
the Third Raikage's lightning.

785
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:09,371
He seems to have some skill.

786
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:12,540
I don't mean to disrespect you,

787
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:15,210
but I'll have to shame you
some more.

788
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:21,049
I may end up stripping the plating
off your silver and gold...

789
00:54:25,636 --> 00:54:28,639
With one strike of my Gale Style!

790
00:54:28,945 --> 00:54:30,697
Even though it's dull.

791
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:37,065
Calm down, Raikage.

792
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,276
You are the Supreme Commander.

793
00:54:40,224 --> 00:54:43,227
You just don't know how frightening
the Gold and Silver Brothers are.

794
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:47,450
I can't believe I just heard
you say the word "frightening."

795
00:54:48,968 --> 00:54:50,678
It's not that I'm scared...

796
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:57,627
They are the most reviled criminals
in the history of the Hidden Cloud.

797
00:55:00,097 --> 00:55:02,432
The brothers staged
a coup d'état during

798
00:55:02,457 --> 00:55:05,543
the alliance ceremony
with the Hidden Leaf

799
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:10,473
and attacked the Second Raikage
and Second Hokage.

800
00:55:14,974 --> 00:55:18,711
It is said they use four of the
Treasured Tools of the Sage of Six Paths.

801
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:22,777
They left the Second Hokage
near death. I know that much.

802
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:28,908
Long ago, it seems the Hidden Cloud
made an attempt to capture the Nine-Tails...

803
00:55:30,152 --> 00:55:34,181
and the Nine-Tails apparently
devoured the Gold and Silver Brothers.

804
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:55,448
But the brothers kept
thrashing around in its stomach,

805
00:55:55,473 --> 00:55:58,893
forcing the Nine-Tails
to vomit them out.

806
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:03,610
Ever since then,

807
00:56:03,635 --> 00:56:06,263
they have been infused
with the Nine-Tails' chakra.

808
00:56:07,152 --> 00:56:09,529
Not surprising, considering they
were inside the Nine-Tails' stomach

809
00:56:09,554 --> 00:56:10,961
for two weeks.

810
00:56:11,915 --> 00:56:15,877
It's hard to believe, but what
about the rumors that they are

811
00:56:15,902 --> 00:56:20,157
able to wield the Treasured Tools
of the Sage of Six Paths?

812
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:23,004
Normal humans cannot handle
the Treasured Tools.

813
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:27,195
They absorb massive amounts
of chakra from its user

814
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:28,722
that would kill the average man.

815
00:56:31,293 --> 00:56:33,462
They are shinobi
with monstrous chakra

816
00:56:33,487 --> 00:56:38,606
who wreak havoc and fear nothing,
not even the Nine-Tails.

817
00:56:39,702 --> 00:56:43,664
What scares me is
the thought of our subordinates

818
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:45,902
who must face them...

819
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:50,240
I don't like that tone
you're using toward your seniors.

820
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,534
I'll shut you up!

821
00:56:53,634 --> 00:56:54,805
It can't be helped.

822
00:56:55,161 --> 00:57:01,543
Seems like a lot of time has passed.
No one knows about us anymore.

823
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:05,046
Samui, Atsui.

824
00:57:05,969 --> 00:57:08,805
If you're really
the Gold and Silver Brothers

825
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:10,540
we read about in our scrolls,

826
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:12,595
don't talk to me
like we're comrades.

827
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:14,472
It's not cool.

828
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:17,892
Well, well... For someone
who's always cool,

829
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,310
you're quite hot right now.

830
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:21,760
I sense that you guys
are pretty formidable.

831
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:32,657
Let's do this, Ginkaku!

832
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:34,367
All right, Kinkaku!

833
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:36,536
What is that?!

834
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:39,747
No doubt about it,
those are the ninja tools

835
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:42,333
of the Gold and Silver Brothers
that were described in the scroll!

836
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:47,172
Four of the five ultimate ninja tools,
which the Hidden Cloud collected long ago.

837
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:51,134
The Kokinjo binds its victim and
squeezes out the victim's spirit word!

838
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:54,762
The Shichiseiken severs and
curses that spirit word...

839
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:59,309
The Benihisago records the spirit
word and seals the speaker within!

840
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:03,229
And the Bashosen conjures up
all five chakra natures:

841
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:06,149
fire, water, lightning,
wind and earth!

842
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:09,903
Sorry to interrupt
your lecture, Sis, but...

843
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:16,484
Let me handle this!

844
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:18,495
<i>Cloud Style: Flame Slice!</i>

845
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:22,415
Those ninja tools look nasty,

846
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:24,042
but ultimately,
they're just mere tools!

847
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:29,088
They're no match for our ninjutsu
that's imbued with our hot souls!

848
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,465
Atsui, wait!

849
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:32,008
Stay cool until I finish!

850
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,135
Damn it! He's too hot-headed!

851
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:39,224
They talk too much...
This is perfect.

852
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:41,768
I'll take the one in the back!

853
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,811
Got it, Ginkaku!

854
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:45,271
Leave the others to me!

855
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,815
The nerve of the guy...
Avoiding someone like me,

856
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:49,609
with a hot fighting spirit,
to go for Darui!

857
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:55,949
Did you think you could avoid
my hot-spirited attack

858
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:57,450
with a crowd of bodies!?

859
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:00,745
Pay attention, Atsui!

860
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:02,205
Stay cool and look around you!

861
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:10,046
That punch was pretty hot!

862
00:59:12,759 --> 00:59:13,760
<i>Damn it!</i>

863
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:16,761
Atsui, Samui! Are you all right?

864
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:19,472
Don't look away, kid!

865
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:24,519
Change places, Kinkaku!

866
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:26,479
Right, Ginkaku.

867
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:29,857
Can't I even stop one foe?

868
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:32,485
Forgive me, Samui, Atsui...

869
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:35,530
Whoa...
I'm your opponent this time!

870
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:39,242
That Kinkaku fellow packed
a pretty hot punch!

871
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:41,786
And this time it's Ginkaku, eh?

872
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:45,123
<i>Squeeze them! Kokinjo!</i>

873
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:54,549
<i>Curse them! Shichiseiken!</i>

874
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:04,475
<i>Record them!</i>

875
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:06,185
<i>Benihisago!</i>

876
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:13,026
All right.
My side is done, Kinkaku.

877
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:15,737
<i>He's been struck...</i>

878
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:17,488
That's what you think, you jerks!

879
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:19,282
It's our turn now!

880
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:22,410
Didn't I tell you to let me finish?

881
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:25,997
Now listen. Don't say another word.

882
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:30,585
What do you mean?

883
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:35,423
A Curse Mark Jutsu and
Sealing Jutsu have been used on us.

884
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:38,217
Our Spirit Words have
been taken hostage.

885
01:00:38,903 --> 01:00:42,055
The word we've uttered
the most since our birth.

886
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,223
If we say that word...

887
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:47,977
We'll be sucked into that gourd
and sealed away.

888
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:50,897
You know a lot, don't you?

889
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:55,109
It seems the passage of time
revealed a lot of things.

890
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,283
The word we've said
the most is now forbidden?

891
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:05,565
We're not playing
some silly word game...

892
01:01:05,747 --> 01:01:07,165
How dull...

893
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:09,582
I see.

894
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:12,627
<i>Bashosen!</i>

895
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,087
<i>What?</i>

896
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:18,675
<i>What is the hot word I love
to use the most?!</i>

897
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:22,470
<i>You probably don't have
to think too hard to figure it out.</i>

898
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:25,056
<i>Scroll of Fire!</i>

899
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:29,811
Hot!

900
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,647
Damn it!

901
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:33,981
Stupid...

902
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:40,655
Atsui!

903
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:48,246
There's an old saying,
"Silence is golden."

904
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:50,206
The mouth is
the source of calamity.

905
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:51,582
Right, Ginkaku?

906
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,459
Yeah, Kinkaku!

907
01:01:53,584 --> 01:01:55,962
This is what happens when
you can't keep your mouth shut.

908
01:01:56,254 --> 01:02:00,007
Words are used to lie. They're
merely tools for deceiving people.

909
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:04,679
If you make fun of words,
Bee will let you have it.

910
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:08,224
Bee? Never heard of him.

911
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:10,643
If you move, the girl dies.

912
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,437
And I'm not lying.

913
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:15,857
I'm sorry, Samui.

914
01:02:25,118 --> 01:02:26,536
Just as I expected.

915
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:29,704
I must say, you're both
true Hidden Cloud shinobi.

916
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:31,164
<i>Gale Style:</i>

917
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:35,251
<i>Laser Circus!</i>

918
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:38,546
<i>He's fast.</i>

919
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,590
<i>And to top it off,
it was a Precision Ninjutsu?</i>

920
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:45,136
Don't take us lightly, brat!

921
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:49,515
Owww...

922
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:52,894
<i>Kinkaku did a good job
of applying the Kokinjo.</i>

923
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:57,899
This one's first.

924
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:06,491
<i>What's going on?!</i>

925
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:09,410
<i>She didn't say a word,
but Samui's been sucked in?!</i>

926
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:12,455
<i>Curse him!</i>

927
01:03:13,698 --> 01:03:15,116
<i>Shichiseiken!</i>

928
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,210
<i>His arm has already regenerated!</i>

929
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:21,255
<i>Record him, Benihisago!</i>

930
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:29,889
<i>The word I've used most often in
my life is without a doubt,</i>

931
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:30,932
<i>"dull."</i>

932
01:03:31,849 --> 01:03:33,495
<i>As long as I don't use it...</i>

933
01:03:34,101 --> 01:03:36,486
<i>I won't be sucked into that gourd.</i>

934
01:03:37,343 --> 01:03:41,180
<i>However... Samui didn't say a word,
but she was sucked in.</i>

935
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:43,538
<i>Which means...</i>

936
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:48,407
If you stay quiet for a fixed amount
of time, you can get sucked in...

937
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:49,992
Am I right?

938
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:52,119
Sharp of you to notice.

939
01:03:52,286 --> 01:03:54,872
It seemed no one had
figured that out yet.

940
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:56,332
You're pretty smart.

941
01:03:57,166 --> 01:04:00,753
"Silence is golden"? As if...

942
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:03,923
They also say that,
"speech is silver"!

943
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:06,403
Especially when spoken
with a forked tongue!

944
01:04:06,514 --> 01:04:10,263
In this case, silence is
the most forbidden taboo.

945
01:04:13,307 --> 01:04:14,600
Didn't I tell you?

946
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:18,229
Words are tools with which
to fool others.

947
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:19,939
In the shinobi world,

948
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:22,775
trickery and betrayal are
fine military tactics.

949
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:24,735
The spoken word is also
a ninja tool.

950
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:28,531
Is it any wonder that you two
are symbols of disgrace

951
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:30,283
among the Hidden Cloud?

952
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:34,287
How dare you say that,
you third-rate underling?!

953
01:04:34,495 --> 01:04:36,789
You're just another pawn
for the Raikage...

954
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:39,500
A mere ninja tool.

955
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:41,335
A mere ninja tool!

956
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:43,416
So you can cut the drivel!

957
01:04:43,456 --> 01:04:46,209
What the hell is wrong
with the ninja of today?

958
01:04:47,091 --> 01:04:48,092
<i>Boss...</i>

959
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:50,469
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

960
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:54,849
<i>I was chosen to be your bodyguard
and yet you lost your left arm...</i>

961
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:57,602
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

962
01:04:57,935 --> 01:04:58,936
<i>But...</i>

963
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:01,272
<i>I don't miss my left arm.</i>

964
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:05,651
<i>After all, I have two right arms.</i>

965
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:08,029
<i>Two?</i>

966
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:10,740
<i>This and...</i>

967
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,201
<i>you.</i>

968
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:21,250
<i>How about including Cee
and making it three?</i>

969
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:24,378
<i>Well, all right.</i>

970
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:26,839
<i>You can never have too many.</i>

971
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:35,139
I am the Boss's courageous
right-hand man...

972
01:05:35,449 --> 01:05:36,700
Not some timid rabbit!

973
01:05:37,558 --> 01:05:38,392
<i>Why?</i>

974
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,894
<i>I didn't say "dull."</i>

975
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:43,773
<i>I am the Boss's courageous
right-hand man.</i>

976
01:05:44,145 --> 01:05:45,563
<i>Not some timid rabbit!</i>

977
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:47,401
<i>I am the Boss's courageous
right-hand man...</i>

978
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:48,486
<i>Not some timid rabbit!</i>

979
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:50,446
<i>Timid rabbit is...</i>

980
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:52,782
<i>Dull!</i>

981
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:55,701
Damn it!

982
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:58,996
My apologies, Samui... Atsui...

983
01:06:02,199 --> 01:06:03,742
My apologies, everyone...

984
01:06:05,269 --> 01:06:06,270
My apologies...

985
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:08,631
My sincerest apologies...

986
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:15,888
Ready to move on, Ginkaku?

987
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:17,723
Right, Kinkaku.

988
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:21,894
Why?!

989
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:30,861
<i>Damn it!</i>

990
01:06:30,903 --> 01:06:32,321
<i>I touched the Kokinjo!</i>

991
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:34,240
Why didn't he...?

992
01:06:44,339 --> 01:06:45,340
<i>I...</i>

993
01:06:46,293 --> 01:06:48,212
<i>I apologize about the desks
and the wall...</i>

994
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:53,926
<i>My apologies for embarrassing you,
Kinkaku and Ginkaku,</i>

995
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:57,013
<i>long revered as the shining light
of the Cloud.</i>

996
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:00,933
<i>Apologies, Samui...</i>

997
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:05,229
<i>I guess that means
I'm a pretty humble guy.</i>

998
01:07:06,063 --> 01:07:07,189
<i>That's not so bad.</i>

999
01:07:09,028 --> 01:07:12,531
Don't tell me...
While he was being sucked in,

1000
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:15,448
his most-used word switched places
with his second-most uttered word?

1001
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:35,342
<i>Curse him! Shichiseiken!</i>

1002
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:38,637
<i>Record him! Benihisago!</i>

1003
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,681
I think that's the way it goes!

1004
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:45,102
Why you...

1005
01:07:47,688 --> 01:07:49,774
This uses up so much... chakra...

1006
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:54,070
I feel like I'm going to drop first.

1007
01:07:57,656 --> 01:08:02,203
It's true... words can be used
as tools to trick people.

1008
01:08:03,854 --> 01:08:06,857
But when it really counts,
the spoken word...

1009
01:08:09,007 --> 01:08:13,052
is a precious thing that conveys
the truth that's right here.

1010
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:16,675
Help me... Kinkaku.

1011
01:08:17,676 --> 01:08:21,138
That's why I'm going
to seal you now.

1012
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,850
Kinkaku!

1013
01:08:34,735 --> 01:08:35,945
<i>Samui... Atsui...</i>

1014
01:08:36,308 --> 01:08:37,601
<i>It's all thanks to you.</i>

1015
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,073
<i>I swear I'll save you later.</i>

1016
01:08:40,574 --> 01:08:43,119
<i>But now... there's one more.</i>

1017
01:08:46,521 --> 01:08:48,565
How dare you!

1018
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:10,229
What?!

1019
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:16,318
Hey, he's exactly like the...

1020
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:23,409
What is that?

1021
01:09:23,909 --> 01:09:24,910
There's more of them?!

1022
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:44,930
It's been a while since I've seen
that happen to Kinkaku.

1023
01:09:45,572 --> 01:09:48,075
So I guess Ginkaku's a goner.

1024
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:01,822
The red and blue balance of
your Tailed Beast chakra looks good!

1025
01:10:01,947 --> 01:10:03,449
Go, Naruto!

1026
01:10:04,491 --> 01:10:06,827
Here I go, Tailed Beast Rasengan...

1027
01:10:10,592 --> 01:10:11,634
Concentrate!

1028
01:10:16,511 --> 01:10:17,804
Didn't work, eh.

1029
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:21,091
You were close.
That's a shame!

1030
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:24,803
You lost your focus!
And you have yourself to blame!

1031
01:10:28,515 --> 01:10:30,350
<i>What was that feeling I just felt?</i>

1032
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:38,108
This is really not good.

1033
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:43,953
I apologize!

1034
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:46,659
<i>It's too late for that!</i>

1035
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:47,743
After all, huh?!

1036
01:11:01,548 --> 01:11:04,551
<i>If I can just seal that one
in this gourd too...</i>

1037
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:08,264
<i>In order to do that though, I need the
Kokinjo to squeeze out his spirit word.</i>

1038
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:13,018
<i>But that rope is on his left arm
covered by the Nine-Tails' Cloak.</i>

1039
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:14,895
<i>I can't get it.</i>

1040
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:18,816
Captain Darui! We got word from HQ!

1041
01:11:19,316 --> 01:11:21,360
They are sending
the Kohaku no Johei.

1042
01:11:22,753 --> 01:11:23,879
I see...

1043
01:11:24,818 --> 01:11:26,779
<i>That would be better than
this gourd.</i>

1044
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:33,247
This is the Kohaku no Johei,
one of the five Treasured Tools,

1045
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:35,207
that was used to
seal the Eight-Tails.

1046
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:37,793
It's more of a pot than a bottle.

1047
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:40,504
It differs from the gourd,
Benihisago, in that...

1048
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:43,549
if the target responds to the voice of
whoever is holding the pot,

1049
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:46,427
his voice is immediately recorded
and he becomes sealed.

1050
01:11:47,741 --> 01:11:50,035
We managed to take
this away from Kinkaku.

1051
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:53,058
We will send this to Darui!

1052
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:55,644
But the situation is urgent.

1053
01:11:56,078 --> 01:11:57,704
Won't it take long to deliver this?

1054
01:11:58,027 --> 01:11:59,211
Lord Raikage...

1055
01:11:59,606 --> 01:12:02,443
Preparations are complete!
We can send this to Darui anytime!

1056
01:12:03,277 --> 01:12:05,779
Mabui uses
the Object Teleportation Jutsu

1057
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:07,698
that transports matter
at the speed of light.

1058
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,409
That is precisely why
she is my personal assistant.

1059
01:12:10,717 --> 01:12:12,928
But if it once belonged to them,

1060
01:12:13,136 --> 01:12:14,930
surely they know how to
counter this tool?

1061
01:12:15,981 --> 01:12:18,901
Although it will depend on how you
make him answer and seal him.

1062
01:12:21,583 --> 01:12:23,752
Then, I have an idea.

1063
01:12:24,981 --> 01:12:27,275
Any strategy you come with
is sure to work.

1064
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:28,594
I leave it to you!

1065
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:30,054
Do it, Mabui!

1066
01:12:30,554 --> 01:12:31,889
<i>Ethereal Transmission Jutsu!</i>

1067
01:12:37,478 --> 01:12:40,939
We are blessed with fine aides,
aren't we, Tsunade?

1068
01:12:41,398 --> 01:12:42,399
You are right.

1069
01:12:48,322 --> 01:12:49,323
<i>It's here!</i>

1070
01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:57,039
<i>That's the Kohaku no Johei that
was once in our possession.</i>

1071
01:12:57,956 --> 01:12:58,957
<i>I see...</i>

1072
01:12:59,473 --> 01:13:01,806
<i>You intend to seal me with that.</i>

1073
01:13:04,254 --> 01:13:05,506
<i>I'm glad it's here...</i>

1074
01:13:05,589 --> 01:13:07,841
<i>But Kinkaku knows
how this tool works.</i>

1075
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:11,345
<i>How am I supposed to seal him?</i>

1076
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:14,431
<i>Well, HQ came up with
this strategy.</i>

1077
01:13:14,823 --> 01:13:17,576
<i>Until I know what that is,
I'll guard it!</i>

1078
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:28,946
Sorry, I can't afford to
let you catch me.

1079
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:35,494
Protect Captain Darui
with your lives!

1080
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:38,247
Fire Style Squad! Go!

1081
01:13:46,046 --> 01:13:47,005
Water Style Squad!

1082
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:56,390
<i>Weaklings!</i>

1083
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:03,772
Earth Style Squad!

1084
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:11,655
Sorry about this...

1085
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:17,369
<i>Double Black Panthers!</i>

1086
01:14:29,256 --> 01:14:30,257
Did he do it?

1087
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:41,310
<i>Why you—!</i>

1088
01:14:42,102 --> 01:14:43,979
<i>I'll tear you all apart!</i>

1089
01:15:00,412 --> 01:15:01,914
They've all been defeated...

1090
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:07,836
by just one man?

1091
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:13,467
A barrage of Fire, Water, Earth
and Lightning Style had no effect.

1092
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:22,059
<i>Forgive me, everyone...</i>

1093
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:28,357
Shikaku, this jutsu
won't last long.

1094
01:15:29,274 --> 01:15:30,442
I know, please do it.

1095
01:15:37,449 --> 01:15:38,450
<i>Darui...</i>

1096
01:15:39,243 --> 01:15:41,245
<i>It's Shikaku from Headquarters!
Listen to me.</i>

1097
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:43,080
<i>I've been waiting to
hear from you...</i>

1098
01:15:43,455 --> 01:15:45,415
<i>You have the Kohaku no Johei,
don't you?</i>

1099
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:48,043
<i>For this plan to be successful,</i>

1100
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:50,921
<i>the Ino-Shika-Cho Formation
is absolutely critical.</i>

1101
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:53,632
<i>Please hold on
until they get there.</i>

1102
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:56,677
<i>Ino-Shika-Cho...
That's...</i>

1103
01:15:56,887 --> 01:15:59,557
<i>But Shikaku and Inoichi
are still at HQ...</i>

1104
01:16:00,597 --> 01:16:04,476
<i>We've lost so many men already.</i>

1105
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:06,603
<i>To hold on is a really tall order.</i>

1106
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:11,316
<i>Where did he go?</i>

1107
01:16:24,346 --> 01:16:25,347
Kitsuchi!

1108
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:26,665
Sorry I'm late!

1109
01:16:28,678 --> 01:16:29,762
Look! Reinforcements!

1110
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:31,461
Over here!

1111
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:35,799
Now, we can keep on fighting!

1112
01:16:38,343 --> 01:16:40,679
<i>Listen! Shikamaru, Choji, Ino...</i>

1113
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:45,642
<i>I am using Inoichi's jutsu to
communicate directly with my thoughts.</i>

1114
01:16:46,018 --> 01:16:47,978
<i>Listen carefully to what I say.</i>

1115
01:16:52,332 --> 01:16:53,333
I see...

1116
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:54,901
So that's the plan.

1117
01:16:55,157 --> 01:16:56,158
I understand.

1118
01:16:58,616 --> 01:17:02,037
<i>So we're going to take care
of this monster Kinkaku</i>

1119
01:17:02,146 --> 01:17:04,398
<i>who killed the Second Hokage!</i>

1120
01:17:04,788 --> 01:17:06,665
<i>What a drag.</i>

1121
01:17:07,164 --> 01:17:09,541
<i>I feel a little scared.</i>

1122
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:13,003
<i>Hey, you guys...
Don't chicken out on me.</i>

1123
01:17:13,709 --> 01:17:17,171
<i>Legends become exaggerated
over time.</i>

1124
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:22,512
<i>And when a legend is surpassed,
new legends are born.</i>

1125
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:30,771
<i>He may have the power of
the Nine-Tails,</i>

1126
01:17:31,233 --> 01:17:34,320
<i>but we have the power of
the Ino-Shika-Cho bond.</i>

1127
01:17:35,942 --> 01:17:41,531
<i>The Ino-Shika-Cho bond ranks in
the top two of ninjutsu legends.</i>

1128
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:43,700
<i>Be confident!</i>

1129
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:50,916
Do not back down!
We must hold the line!

1130
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:01,927
More reinforcements...

1131
01:18:09,309 --> 01:18:10,519
Sorry we're late.

1132
01:18:10,602 --> 01:18:11,603
He...

1133
01:18:13,330 --> 01:18:14,998
How could he...?

1134
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:17,442
Everyone, cover them!

1135
01:18:17,567 --> 01:18:19,319
Hurl your kunai!

1136
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,369
<i>You third-rate underlings!</i>

1137
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,002
How is it going?

1138
01:18:36,628 --> 01:18:38,171
<i>You're just weaklings...</i>

1139
01:18:38,865 --> 01:18:41,868
<i>As if you can bring me down!</i>

1140
01:18:42,092 --> 01:18:44,219
<i>Human Boulder!</i>

1141
01:18:44,428 --> 01:18:45,762
<i>Why you...</i>

1142
01:18:57,190 --> 01:18:58,942
<i>Shadow Possession complete!</i>

1143
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:02,988
<i>One petty trick after another...</i>

1144
01:19:05,532 --> 01:19:06,950
<i>What extraordinary power...</i>

1145
01:19:09,661 --> 01:19:12,289
<i>This is nothing. I can break it
in an instant.</i>

1146
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,293
He broke through
the Shadow Possession!

1147
01:19:16,668 --> 01:19:18,420
<i>Die!</i>

1148
01:19:22,674 --> 01:19:24,426
Nice timing, Ino...

1149
01:19:28,305 --> 01:19:30,932
<i>Got him!
Mind Transfer Jutsu complete!</i>

1150
01:19:31,016 --> 01:19:32,017
All right.

1151
01:19:32,184 --> 01:19:33,185
Kinkaku!

1152
01:19:33,393 --> 01:19:34,394
<i>Yes!</i>

1153
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:37,981
Come back, Ino!

1154
01:19:48,816 --> 01:19:49,817
Ino!

1155
01:19:52,537 --> 01:19:53,538
Choji!

1156
01:20:02,714 --> 01:20:05,258
For being scared,
you did pretty well, Choji!

1157
01:20:06,343 --> 01:20:09,054
I feel like I lost a ton of weight
from all that cold sweat.

1158
01:20:09,382 --> 01:20:13,720
That was just a feeling.
You look fine, the same as always.

1159
01:20:14,172 --> 01:20:15,798
<i>It went exactly as planned.</i>

1160
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:19,230
<i>Well done, Choji.</i>

1161
01:20:20,899 --> 01:20:23,109
<i>You've gotten good at controlling</i>

1162
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:26,196
<i>the speed and release of
your Mind Transfer, Ino.</i>

1163
01:20:27,748 --> 01:20:30,709
Units 6 through 10,
search for wounded!

1164
01:20:31,117 --> 01:20:32,786
The rest, follow me!

1165
01:20:42,087 --> 01:20:46,842
<i>The rope that squeezes out Spirit Words
has been sealed along with Kinkaku...</i>

1166
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:49,135
<i>So he can't use the ninja tool.</i>

1167
01:20:50,303 --> 01:20:53,807
<i>Now then, one more ninja tool...
Where is the Bashosen?</i>

1168
01:21:00,635 --> 01:21:02,428
Let's go, Choji... Ino!

1169
01:21:02,513 --> 01:21:03,555
Already?

1170
01:21:03,733 --> 01:21:04,860
C'mon, stand up.

1171
01:21:17,564 --> 01:21:18,607
Th-That's...!

1172
01:21:24,023 --> 01:21:27,193
Long time no see,
you Ino-Shika-Cho brats.

1173
01:21:28,008 --> 01:21:30,343
You're Kakuzu, right?

1174
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,226
We took the "Gold."

1175
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:37,017
As for the "Bishop," we know your tricks
and how good you are...

1176
01:21:37,544 --> 01:21:40,047
From now on, we're on the offensive.

1177
01:21:40,645 --> 01:21:42,480
The brat who uses shadows.

1178
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:47,444
Your being here means that
Hidan has been stopped, huh?

1179
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:52,741
Did he get his head chopped off again
while he was praying?

1180
01:21:53,533 --> 01:21:58,246
Or does it mean he's not here
because he's still alive?

1181
01:21:58,587 --> 01:22:01,132
As if we know what he's doing
while he's rotting away somewhere!

1182
01:22:02,467 --> 01:22:04,391
So I don't have a rook,

1183
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:07,043
my gold and silver were taken and
I'm completely on the defensive.

1184
01:22:10,432 --> 01:22:12,351
That's the fifth one.

1185
01:22:16,306 --> 01:22:17,807
That's right...

1186
01:22:17,849 --> 01:22:20,852
That guy has five hearts, so we have
to bring him down five times.

1187
01:22:21,102 --> 01:22:23,063
Yeah, you're right.

1188
01:22:23,563 --> 01:22:26,483
Time to finish the game.

1189
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:38,161
By the way,

1190
01:22:38,203 --> 01:22:41,456
we also have gold and
silver pieces too.

1191
01:22:42,215 --> 01:22:45,683
Would you be interested
in knowing who they might be?

1192
01:22:48,613 --> 01:22:52,075
Dan Kato... Lady Tsunade's lover.

1193
01:22:53,468 --> 01:22:54,636
And...

1194
01:23:03,269 --> 01:23:04,771
Asuma Sarutobi.

1195
01:23:05,563 --> 01:23:08,650
The son of the Third Hokage,
and your master.

1196
01:23:09,109 --> 01:23:11,111
Asuma... Sensei!

1197
01:23:11,903 --> 01:23:16,491
I guess you're not the only ones
who took game pieces.

1198
01:23:16,783 --> 01:23:18,952
We have a few others as well.

1199
01:23:20,245 --> 01:23:21,663
Ironic, isn't it?

1200
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:24,833
Why you—!

1201
01:23:27,585 --> 01:23:28,586
Choza!

1202
01:23:28,611 --> 01:23:30,488
Why is the Four Flames Formation
taking so long?

1203
01:23:31,245 --> 01:23:33,288
Hurry up and shut me inside
the barrier...

1204
01:23:33,883 --> 01:23:36,177
before I use my Spirit
Transformation Jutsu!

1205
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:38,471
It's not that simple.

1206
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:40,432
Not when you're the target!

1207
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:46,396
A weird black thing has appeared!

1208
01:23:47,230 --> 01:23:48,231
Watch out!

1209
01:23:51,109 --> 01:23:52,819
Let's begin our counterattack.

1210
01:23:59,856 --> 01:24:04,248
We owe you one. I hope you
haven't forgotten, you stitch-face!

1211
01:24:04,497 --> 01:24:07,834
Sorry, I don't remember anyone
who can't make me money.

1212
01:24:08,209 --> 01:24:10,545
They say that money talks,
even in hell.

1213
01:24:11,087 --> 01:24:14,132
Was that true for you?

1214
01:24:17,427 --> 01:24:18,386
Masters!

1215
01:24:18,386 --> 01:24:20,138
Izumo, Kotetsu!

1216
01:24:20,597 --> 01:24:22,307
Shikamaru! Choji! Ino!

1217
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:24,392
Help us seal him!

1218
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:26,519
<i>Izumo, Kotetsu...</i>

1219
01:24:26,519 --> 01:24:29,064
<i>You two and Darui will be left
to deal with Kakuzu.</i>

1220
01:24:29,564 --> 01:24:31,232
<i>Kakuzu uses Earth Style.</i>

1221
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:33,735
<i>Center your battle on
Darui's Lightning Style.</i>

1222
01:24:34,277 --> 01:24:36,196
<i>Shikamaru, Choji and Ino
will take on Asuma.</i>

1223
01:24:37,822 --> 01:24:40,450
<i>But... that's too harsh!</i>

1224
01:24:40,575 --> 01:24:42,744
<i>Master Asuma is their teacher!</i>

1225
01:24:42,869 --> 01:24:44,204
<i>You can't do that!</i>

1226
01:24:44,746 --> 01:24:47,665
<i>They were Asuma's students,
the former Team 10.</i>

1227
01:24:47,707 --> 01:24:50,752
<i>They know Asuma better
than anyone else.</i>

1228
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:52,712
<i>They have the best chance
of winning.</i>

1229
01:24:53,254 --> 01:24:54,422
But...

1230
01:24:54,547 --> 01:24:58,009
<i>No complaining! This is war!</i>

1231
01:24:58,384 --> 01:25:00,178
<i>One that must be won!</i>

1232
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:01,846
But...

1233
01:25:04,015 --> 01:25:05,100
I...

1234
01:25:06,932 --> 01:25:07,933
I'm going.

1235
01:25:08,353 --> 01:25:09,646
Shikamaru!

1236
01:25:12,148 --> 01:25:13,733
What'll you do, Ino?

1237
01:25:14,317 --> 01:25:15,443
Choji!

1238
01:25:16,361 --> 01:25:18,279
Take a good look around you,
at your comrades!

1239
01:25:24,244 --> 01:25:25,245
Go!

1240
01:25:44,764 --> 01:25:46,766
Come at me!

1241
01:25:52,891 --> 01:25:53,850
Choza!

1242
01:25:54,138 --> 01:25:55,400
I know!

1243
01:26:10,915 --> 01:26:12,000
Choji...

1244
01:26:12,645 --> 01:26:15,898
Do you remember
Asuma-sensei's dying words?

1245
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:22,635
<i>Choji...</i>

1246
01:26:23,408 --> 01:26:26,619
<i>You're a kind man who
cares for his comrades...</i>

1247
01:26:27,502 --> 01:26:28,795
<i>That's why...</i>

1248
01:26:29,673 --> 01:26:31,967
<i>you'll become a shinobi who's stronger
than anyone else.</i>

1249
01:26:32,837 --> 01:26:35,673
<i>Be more confident in yourself.</i>

1250
01:26:50,955 --> 01:26:55,293
<i>You're strong-willed,
and dependable.</i>

1251
01:26:56,357 --> 01:27:00,904
<i>Both Choji and Shikamaru,
they're clumsy.</i>

1252
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:03,593
<i>So please take care of them.</i>

1253
01:27:10,141 --> 01:27:11,476
Let's go, you guys.

1254
01:27:11,684 --> 01:27:12,685
Right!

1255
01:27:12,894 --> 01:27:13,603
U-Uh-huh...

1256
01:27:22,153 --> 01:27:24,155
You haven't been getting it
for a while.

1257
01:27:24,155 --> 01:27:26,783
Half-hearted attention,
not enough preparation.

1258
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:35,083
Something's been bothering me
for a while now.

1259
01:27:35,124 --> 01:27:36,167
What is it?

1260
01:27:37,688 --> 01:27:39,065
Earlier...

1261
01:27:39,337 --> 01:27:42,257
I thought I sensed
the Nine-Tails' chakra.

1262
01:27:42,548 --> 01:27:45,510
But there's no way someone else

1263
01:27:45,899 --> 01:27:47,512
has the Nine-Tails' chakra, right?

1264
01:27:47,815 --> 01:27:49,024
You probably just imagined it.

1265
01:27:49,722 --> 01:27:53,017
chakra here is cut off,
both inside and out.

1266
01:27:53,434 --> 01:27:57,021
Nine-Tails is only inside you.
It's a bad joke, no doubt.

1267
01:27:58,067 --> 01:28:00,236
<i>Naruto's beginning to
sense things.</i>

1268
01:28:01,025 --> 01:28:03,319
<i>The only ones with
Nine-Tails' chakra besides Naruto,</i>

1269
01:28:03,361 --> 01:28:05,280
<i>are the Gold and Silver Brothers.</i>

1270
01:28:05,405 --> 01:28:10,201
<i>Which means, they've been resurrected
with Orochimaru's jutsu.</i>

1271
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:15,397
<i>However, he has the power to perceive
the chakra more intensely in this room.</i>

1272
01:28:15,957 --> 01:28:18,001
<i>We won't be able to fool him
much longer.</i>

1273
01:28:18,251 --> 01:28:19,419
<i>What'll we do, Bee?</i>

1274
01:28:19,585 --> 01:28:20,378
Do what?

1275
01:28:20,586 --> 01:28:22,005
<i>What do you mean, "do what"?</i>

1276
01:28:22,171 --> 01:28:24,549
<i>Weren't you paying
attention to the plan?</i>

1277
01:28:24,549 --> 01:28:26,551
<i>We're not supposed to
let Naruto out of this space!</i>

1278
01:28:26,676 --> 01:28:28,886
That's what you're here for, Eight!

1279
01:28:29,178 --> 01:28:31,222
<i>What a...! Damn it.</i>

1280
01:28:35,184 --> 01:28:36,519
Where's the bathroom?

1281
01:28:37,186 --> 01:28:39,564
Go outside.
It's the door to your left.

1282
01:28:39,970 --> 01:28:42,264
<i>You idiot!
Naruto's going to escape!</i>

1283
01:28:42,477 --> 01:28:43,478
<i>Follow him!</i>

1284
01:28:43,953 --> 01:28:44,954
Oh!

1285
01:28:48,281 --> 01:28:50,199
Don't panic. Contact HQ.

1286
01:28:50,408 --> 01:28:51,409
What?

1287
01:28:51,701 --> 01:28:53,828
Nine-Tails is attempting to go out?

1288
01:28:54,203 --> 01:28:56,080
What is Bee doing?!

1289
01:28:56,289 --> 01:29:00,168
Actually, Master Bee wasn't paying
much attention to the instructions...

1290
01:29:00,693 --> 01:29:02,278
However, we've taken measures.

1291
01:29:02,628 --> 01:29:04,505
Lady Tsunade, please issue the order.

1292
01:29:05,089 --> 01:29:06,257
Mmhmm.

1293
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:09,302
Stop... Naruto.

1294
01:29:12,847 --> 01:29:14,515
<i>Why are there so many guards?!</i>

1295
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:17,143
<i>Something's not right.</i>

1296
01:29:17,727 --> 01:29:21,105
Naruto, I'm sorry,
but I cannot let you pass.

1297
01:29:22,398 --> 01:29:24,275
Please go back to that room.

1298
01:29:24,942 --> 01:29:28,029
Okay, but why is Shino's pop here?

1299
01:29:28,279 --> 01:29:30,323
Why are you watching me?!

1300
01:29:30,573 --> 01:29:34,077
Enough! Just go back inside,
I'll tell you there.

1301
01:29:34,577 --> 01:29:37,663
Why can't you tell me outside?

1302
01:29:40,124 --> 01:29:43,336
Shibi, I'll talk to him.

1303
01:29:47,173 --> 01:29:49,258
I-Iruka-sensei!

1304
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:52,853
What are you doing on this island?!

1305
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:59,435
We now have a secondary mission
on this island.

1306
01:29:59,936 --> 01:30:02,188
And we're here to back you up.

1307
01:30:02,939 --> 01:30:04,982
We heard this place is dangerous.

1308
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:07,402
So why can't I go outside?

1309
01:30:08,694 --> 01:30:11,531
There's an unidentified creature

1310
01:30:11,572 --> 01:30:13,574
that we're trying to confirm.

1311
01:30:14,158 --> 01:30:14,992
That's because...

1312
01:30:15,034 --> 01:30:17,745
I sensed the Nine-Tails' chakra.

1313
01:30:18,246 --> 01:30:19,831
Is that related somehow?

1314
01:30:20,748 --> 01:30:23,835
<i>He was able to perceive Kinkaku and
Ginkaku's chakra even in here?</i>

1315
01:30:23,876 --> 01:30:25,795
<i>A place where all chakra
is blocked out?</i>

1316
01:30:26,129 --> 01:30:27,839
<i>Letting him out would
be dangerous.</i>

1317
01:30:28,339 --> 01:30:30,007
<i>We must stop him.</i>

1318
01:30:32,093 --> 01:30:34,303
<i>Do your best to convince him, Iruka.</i>

1319
01:30:35,179 --> 01:30:37,140
O-Oh, yeah.

1320
01:30:37,954 --> 01:30:40,540
The creature seems to possess
the Nine-Tails' chakra.

1321
01:30:41,185 --> 01:30:45,022
I guess there were others
like the Nine-Tails here.

1322
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,275
We can't afford to let you out

1323
01:30:47,316 --> 01:30:51,195
and rile up the Nine-Tails
inside you.

1324
01:30:51,571 --> 01:30:54,699
That's why we want you
to stay inside and lay low.

1325
01:30:55,575 --> 01:30:58,703
Is that why Captain Yamato
hasn't come back?

1326
01:30:59,175 --> 01:31:03,054
Yes. The Wood Style works best
to suppress the Nine-Tails' chakra.

1327
01:31:04,083 --> 01:31:05,168
You know that.

1328
01:31:05,626 --> 01:31:08,045
Come on, let's go back inside.

1329
01:31:11,132 --> 01:31:15,553
<i>Master Bee stands at the top
of this island's hierarchy of beasts.</i>

1330
01:31:17,196 --> 01:31:21,934
<i>That feeling I had when I
exchanged punches with old man Bee...</i>

1331
01:31:22,143 --> 01:31:24,812
<i>That was for real.</i>

1332
01:31:27,523 --> 01:31:30,401
If those animals are running amok,
I'll suppress them.

1333
01:31:30,693 --> 01:31:32,695
Let me check them out!

1334
01:31:42,163 --> 01:31:43,331
Do not let Naruto escape!

1335
01:31:43,372 --> 01:31:44,373
Right!

1336
01:31:57,720 --> 01:31:59,931
All right! I have him restrained
with Shadow Possession!

1337
01:32:23,496 --> 01:32:26,082
Wh-What's going on?

1338
01:32:26,999 --> 01:32:29,585
<i>He sensed it all with Sage Mode.</i>

1339
01:32:29,961 --> 01:32:32,547
Why is this happening?!

1340
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:34,006
It's war...

1341
01:32:34,966 --> 01:32:36,634
Madara is waging war on us.

1342
01:32:38,010 --> 01:32:39,762
Hey, Iruka! You...

1343
01:32:39,934 --> 01:32:43,354
Shibi, let's stop lying.

1344
01:32:44,058 --> 01:32:45,434
Naruto isn't stupid.

1345
01:32:46,009 --> 01:32:47,511
We should tell him the truth

1346
01:32:47,631 --> 01:32:49,549
and try to make him see
where we're coming from.

1347
01:32:49,939 --> 01:32:52,984
My comrades are fighting,
and going through hell...

1348
01:32:53,192 --> 01:32:55,528
Why are you keeping
all this from me?

1349
01:32:55,945 --> 01:33:00,366
This is a war to protect you.

1350
01:33:02,009 --> 01:33:04,929
Madara launched
a full-scale assault.

1351
01:33:05,621 --> 01:33:09,292
In order to capture Nine-Tails
and Eight-Tails

1352
01:33:09,333 --> 01:33:11,502
inside you and Lord Killer Bee.

1353
01:33:12,369 --> 01:33:14,538
If he succeeds in getting
both Tailed Beasts,

1354
01:33:14,714 --> 01:33:18,467
his jutsu will be complete,
and this world will end!

1355
01:33:18,926 --> 01:33:22,013
Protecting you means
protecting the future,

1356
01:33:22,054 --> 01:33:23,889
and protecting everyone.

1357
01:33:24,515 --> 01:33:26,767
Everyone is putting
their lives on the line.

1358
01:33:26,809 --> 01:33:28,686
They are fighting to protect you.

1359
01:33:28,728 --> 01:33:31,814
Naruto, your battle is with yourself.

1360
01:33:32,773 --> 01:33:34,275
This is where you must endure it.

1361
01:33:34,984 --> 01:33:36,819
Now, let's go back in.

1362
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:43,993
I'll stop this war by myself.

1363
01:33:45,161 --> 01:33:49,665
I'll take on all
the hatred and the pain.

1364
01:33:49,874 --> 01:33:51,292
This is my duty!

1365
01:33:53,002 --> 01:33:54,879
Haven't you been listening?!

1366
01:33:55,254 --> 01:33:57,381
You have the Nine-Tails inside you!

1367
01:33:57,423 --> 01:33:59,759
This isn't only about you, Naruto!

1368
01:34:00,468 --> 01:34:04,263
You were the very first teacher
who recognized me,

1369
01:34:04,847 --> 01:34:06,932
yet you're only concerned
about the Nine-Tails!

1370
01:34:06,974 --> 01:34:08,768
Why can't you have faith in me?!

1371
01:34:08,851 --> 01:34:10,102
Don't act like a spoiled brat!

1372
01:34:10,478 --> 01:34:11,937
To me, you are...

1373
01:34:13,648 --> 01:34:15,191
To me, you are...

1374
01:34:16,317 --> 01:34:18,527
An important student.

1375
01:34:19,292 --> 01:34:20,293
And...

1376
01:34:21,113 --> 01:34:23,074
I think of you as my little brother.

1377
01:34:27,078 --> 01:34:30,331
The enemy leader is targeting you
with everything he's got.

1378
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:35,211
How can we allow you to
face such danger?

1379
01:34:35,836 --> 01:34:39,298
And besides, there is no reason
for you to shoulder that burden alone.

1380
01:34:39,423 --> 01:34:41,717
I'm different from before.

1381
01:34:42,259 --> 01:34:43,260
I've become stronger!

1382
01:34:44,053 --> 01:34:47,556
And Sensei, you're the one
who gave me that headband.

1383
01:35:01,612 --> 01:35:03,239
Hey... Iruka...

1384
01:35:22,102 --> 01:35:23,103
No!

1385
01:35:26,167 --> 01:35:28,829
I still can't let you go!

1386
01:35:34,839 --> 01:35:38,551
Sensei, didn't I tell you
I'm stronger now?

1387
01:35:39,761 --> 01:35:41,471
A barrier like this is...

1388
01:35:44,700 --> 01:35:45,548
He broke through!

1389
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:46,574
I won't let him!

1390
01:35:55,474 --> 01:35:57,476
<i>The Nine-Tails' chakra is too strong.</i>

1391
01:35:57,501 --> 01:35:59,462
<i>The Parasitic Insects are useless!</i>

1392
01:36:01,226 --> 01:36:02,043
Temui!

1393
01:36:02,068 --> 01:36:05,030
Notify the Barrier Corps up ahead
that Naruto is heading their way.

1394
01:36:05,219 --> 01:36:06,179
Right!

1395
01:36:06,204 --> 01:36:07,497
The rest of us will pursue Naruto!

1396
01:36:07,678 --> 01:36:08,679
Let's go!

1397
01:36:11,098 --> 01:36:13,768
<i>Why, Iruka-sensei?</i>

1398
01:36:30,659 --> 01:36:31,911
What's this?

1399
01:36:34,371 --> 01:36:38,667
<i>Knowing you, you will rush
to the battlefield.</i>

1400
01:36:39,752 --> 01:36:41,629
<i>That's how determined you are.</i>

1401
01:36:41,670 --> 01:36:44,256
<i>If you are reading this letter...</i>

1402
01:36:44,298 --> 01:36:46,759
<i>it means I wasn't able to
stop you.</i>

1403
01:36:47,868 --> 01:36:51,038
<i>Ever since Lady Tsunade
ordered me</i>

1404
01:36:51,063 --> 01:36:55,567
<i>to detain you on
the Cloud's secret hidden island,</i>

1405
01:36:56,072 --> 01:37:00,243
<i>I've had this letter ready,
for this very moment.</i>

1406
01:37:00,773 --> 01:37:03,317
<i>I'm disappointed in myself
for failing my mission.</i>

1407
01:37:03,761 --> 01:37:07,514
<i>I don't know if I'll even
be able to get you this note,</i>

1408
01:37:07,721 --> 01:37:10,766
<i>but there's something
you need to hear from me.</i>

1409
01:37:12,785 --> 01:37:17,331
<i>You've gone off,
so this is the only thing left to say.</i>

1410
01:37:19,458 --> 01:37:23,128
<i>Come back alive, no matter what.</i>

1411
01:37:28,259 --> 01:37:31,720
<i>I'm sorry, Naruto. I'm weak.</i>

1412
01:37:33,063 --> 01:37:34,981
<i>I act like your older brother,</i>

1413
01:37:35,006 --> 01:37:37,300
<i>but I've never been able
to protect you...</i>

1414
01:37:40,396 --> 01:37:43,566
So he's gone... fool, that fool.

1415
01:37:47,528 --> 01:37:49,947
Killer... Bee, right?

1416
01:37:51,204 --> 01:37:52,622
I need to ask you a favor.

1417
01:37:54,159 --> 01:37:56,328
<i>I'm not sure,
but I've seen you someplace</i>

1418
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:58,956
<i>Every time,
I can't remember the face.</i>

1419
01:38:00,374 --> 01:38:02,167
Please protect Naruto!

1420
01:38:07,312 --> 01:38:09,230
That's not the way to appeal, you see.

1421
01:38:09,599 --> 01:38:12,227
You have to raise your fist at me.

1422
01:38:13,929 --> 01:38:15,806
L-Like this?

1423
01:38:20,394 --> 01:38:22,855
Gotcha! Fool, ya fool!

1424
01:38:27,278 --> 01:38:28,738
It's you...

1425
01:38:31,739 --> 01:38:34,408
<i>Should you be making
a promise like that?!</i>

1426
01:38:34,658 --> 01:38:37,912
<i>You're Naruto's guard!</i>

1427
01:38:38,621 --> 01:38:42,541
<i>If he couldn't stop Naruto,
no one can.</i>

1428
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,126
<i>That's because...</i>

1429
01:38:45,336 --> 01:38:48,631
You're always in Naruto's heart.

1430
01:38:48,872 --> 01:38:50,749
You are his state of mind.

1431
01:38:52,284 --> 01:38:55,329
Me? In Naruto...?

1432
01:38:56,597 --> 01:38:58,974
I don't know what you did to Naruto...

1433
01:38:59,016 --> 01:39:02,561
But to him,
you are someone special

1434
01:39:02,603 --> 01:39:04,897
Even though my rap style is informal.

1435
01:39:05,554 --> 01:39:08,500
Naruto listens to all you say.

1436
01:39:08,525 --> 01:39:11,528
Naruto has kept it safe inside him,
to this day.

1437
01:39:12,154 --> 01:39:15,783
What has protected Naruto
all this time...? What were your words to him?

1438
01:39:27,795 --> 01:39:31,048
<i>Are you seriously going to leave
this place to go after Naruto?</i>

1439
01:39:31,133 --> 01:39:34,220
We're still in training, you fool, ya fool!

1440
01:39:34,468 --> 01:39:37,137
<i>You're going to get
Raikage's Iron Claw afterward,</i>

1441
01:39:37,179 --> 01:39:38,305
<i>that's for sure!</i>

1442
01:39:38,806 --> 01:39:42,351
You learn faster in
actual battle, you fool!

1443
01:39:42,376 --> 01:39:44,420
We're taking the shortcut, ya fool!

1444
01:39:45,729 --> 01:39:47,356
What is the meaning of this, Tsunade?!

1445
01:39:47,606 --> 01:39:49,817
The Nine-Tails couldn't be stopped!

1446
01:39:50,484 --> 01:39:51,902
<i>That Iruka...</i>

1447
01:39:52,969 --> 01:39:55,305
We'll just have to use force.

1448
01:39:55,906 --> 01:39:57,449
What's the status of
the Barrier Corps?

1449
01:39:57,783 --> 01:40:01,495
They've put up a 36-layer Self-Regenerating
Barrier around the perimeter.

1450
01:40:01,959 --> 01:40:04,170
Even a Jinchuriki will not be able
to pierce through it.

1451
01:40:04,456 --> 01:40:05,708
Please rest assured.

1452
01:40:08,335 --> 01:40:10,254
It's Naruto! He's approaching!

1453
01:40:11,505 --> 01:40:14,383
It's time for us to show what we,
the Barrier Corps, can do!

1454
01:40:14,633 --> 01:40:18,012
This is the reason why
we went through all that hardship,

1455
01:40:18,430 --> 01:40:21,433
to put up this multi-layered barrier!

1456
01:40:21,515 --> 01:40:22,933
Do not let him pass!

1457
01:40:23,726 --> 01:40:26,270
The only message HQ
will receive from us is...

1458
01:40:26,311 --> 01:40:28,147
"Mission accomplished!"

1459
01:40:28,172 --> 01:40:29,966
Do you understand?!

1460
01:40:32,359 --> 01:40:33,360
Wha—?!

1461
01:40:39,260 --> 01:40:40,094
What's this?!

1462
01:40:40,119 --> 01:40:42,205
Up ahead stands a barrier wall.

1463
01:40:42,230 --> 01:40:44,232
We're gonna smash it and make it fall!

1464
01:40:45,164 --> 01:40:46,540
Octopops!

1465
01:40:53,212 --> 01:40:55,339
I'll break the barrier, fool!

1466
01:40:55,587 --> 01:40:58,799
Naruto, you get the Tailed
Beast Bomb in, ya fool!

1467
01:40:59,069 --> 01:40:59,920
Right!

1468
01:41:04,349 --> 01:41:06,477
Bee the Eight-Tails too?!

1469
01:41:06,643 --> 01:41:07,394
What?!

1470
01:41:07,519 --> 01:41:10,397
Here we go, ya fool!

1471
01:41:18,989 --> 01:41:19,990
It's no use!

1472
01:41:20,032 --> 01:41:22,451
The barrier isn't regenerating
fast enough!

1473
01:41:24,161 --> 01:41:25,454
At this rate...

1474
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:27,331
Chief...

1475
01:41:27,498 --> 01:41:29,833
What do I tell HQ...?!

1476
01:41:33,796 --> 01:41:35,214
We couldn't stop him!

1477
01:41:35,380 --> 01:41:38,008
Yeah, I figured.

1478
01:42:07,746 --> 01:42:09,623
– D-Damn it!
– It's no use...

1479
01:42:15,420 --> 01:42:18,465
But there were two
of them breaking it.

1480
01:42:18,907 --> 01:42:21,827
No one mentioned
there were two of them!

1481
01:42:24,012 --> 01:42:25,013
There it is!

1482
01:42:32,855 --> 01:42:35,524
Huh? Wasn't this an island?

1483
01:42:35,915 --> 01:42:37,583
How come it's connected to land?

1484
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:40,442
Minor stuff you don't need to know...

1485
01:42:40,467 --> 01:42:41,843
Now, are ya ready?
'Cuz here we go.

1486
01:42:49,454 --> 01:42:51,456
I'm bored with playing cards.

1487
01:42:52,833 --> 01:42:55,085
How else can we amuse ourselves?

1488
01:43:02,634 --> 01:43:04,219
<i>Found them!</i>

1489
01:43:04,428 --> 01:43:05,846
<i>This is it!</i>

1490
01:43:16,273 --> 01:43:18,734
<i>So before I can get
the Feudal Lords,</i>

1491
01:43:18,775 --> 01:43:22,487
<i>I have to get
through you first, huh.</i>

1492
01:43:23,238 --> 01:43:24,656
Get through us.

1493
01:43:40,214 --> 01:43:42,841
It's noisy outside.

1494
01:43:43,842 --> 01:43:46,845
How am I supposed
to concentrate?

1495
01:44:00,234 --> 01:44:01,276
<i>Lava Style!</i>

1496
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:11,286
<i>Chojuro...</i>

1497
01:44:11,662 --> 01:44:14,289
I won't let you...!

1498
01:44:22,631 --> 01:44:25,968
<i>The Eight-Tails' and
Nine-Tails' chakra!</i>

1499
01:44:27,124 --> 01:44:29,293
<i>They've appeared at last!</i>

1500
01:44:30,264 --> 01:44:32,557
<i>I must send word.</i>

1501
01:44:45,195 --> 01:44:48,532
Looks like the Eight-Tails and
Nine-Tails have appeared.

1502
01:44:51,410 --> 01:44:54,288
So the Eight-Tails and
Nine-Tails are out.

1503
01:44:54,329 --> 01:44:56,373
But what about the Feudal Lords?

1504
01:44:57,165 --> 01:45:01,211
We should capture them to use
as bargaining chips, right?

1505
01:45:01,962 --> 01:45:04,840
No, we don't need
the Feudal Lords anymore.

1506
01:45:05,340 --> 01:45:06,842
If we capture them,

1507
01:45:06,883 --> 01:45:10,304
the nations would pressure
the Allied Shinobi Forces.

1508
01:45:10,387 --> 01:45:13,307
But from the very beginning,
those lords were mere tools

1509
01:45:13,348 --> 01:45:16,101
to lure the Eight and
Nine-Tails out.

1510
01:45:17,728 --> 01:45:20,147
Now that the Eight and
Nine-Tails have emerged,

1511
01:45:20,147 --> 01:45:23,150
there's no need for
indirect measures.

1512
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:25,235
We're dealing with the Raikage.

1513
01:45:25,277 --> 01:45:30,449
He's aware that in this war,
the Feudal Lords have no value.

1514
01:45:31,261 --> 01:45:36,141
If Project Tsuki no Me succeeds,
it's all over.

1515
01:45:37,178 --> 01:45:38,304
What, really?

1516
01:45:38,357 --> 01:45:41,735
So Black Zetsu is fighting
Mizukage for nothing?

1517
01:45:42,002 --> 01:45:47,341
No. shinobi still cannot disregard
the Feudal Lords who hired them.

1518
01:45:48,060 --> 01:45:50,313
Tell Black Zetsu to continue
his guerilla assault.

1519
01:45:52,215 --> 01:45:55,176
By stalling the Mizukage
and her men there,

1520
01:45:55,201 --> 01:45:57,703
we'll be able to split up
the enemy's battle strength.

1521
01:45:59,227 --> 01:46:01,480
It's finally time for me
to join the battle.

1522
01:46:02,647 --> 01:46:05,567
First, I'm going to steal
the substitute.

1523
01:46:13,158 --> 01:46:15,744
<i>It took time to find that
important sword.</i>

1524
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:18,914
<i>Now then,
where's that damn Kakuzu?</i>

1525
01:46:25,503 --> 01:46:27,088
<i>I picked this up earlier...</i>

1526
01:46:34,596 --> 01:46:37,057
<i>What? I'm pretty good at using it!</i>

1527
01:46:40,685 --> 01:46:42,354
You're not getting away!

1528
01:46:49,460 --> 01:46:52,213
All right! I got the one
that produces lightning!

1529
01:46:53,156 --> 01:46:56,368
<i>This thing is great!
But I wonder who lost it?</i>

1530
01:47:02,749 --> 01:47:05,544
Did you think I'd stay put?

1531
01:47:08,463 --> 01:47:09,589
Captain Darui!

1532
01:47:10,125 --> 01:47:12,211
I got the orders from HQ...

1533
01:47:12,592 --> 01:47:13,718
But!

1534
01:47:20,392 --> 01:47:22,978
Captain, let's attack with
Lightning Style all at once!

1535
01:47:23,562 --> 01:47:27,607
I'm sorry. I went overboard earlier.

1536
01:47:28,483 --> 01:47:30,485
I don't have enough chakra.

1537
01:47:31,029 --> 01:47:32,780
Can you give me a moment?

1538
01:47:33,613 --> 01:47:34,698
We're going after him, Kotetsu!

1539
01:47:34,698 --> 01:47:35,699
Right!

1540
01:47:37,784 --> 01:47:39,828
I'm really sorry.

1541
01:47:50,589 --> 01:47:51,756
All right!

1542
01:47:56,178 --> 01:47:58,430
<i>The kunai were to distract us.</i>

1543
01:47:58,472 --> 01:47:59,723
<i>This is what they were after.</i>

1544
01:48:13,798 --> 01:48:14,841
So strong!

1545
01:48:14,866 --> 01:48:15,867
Damn it!

1546
01:48:25,248 --> 01:48:27,167
<i>Fire Style: Burning Ash!</i>

1547
01:48:29,753 --> 01:48:30,670
What is this...?!

1548
01:48:30,712 --> 01:48:31,796
A smoke screen?!

1549
01:48:56,740 --> 01:48:57,824
It's you guys...

1550
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:06,082
We're prepared for the inevitable.

1551
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:09,838
So Sensei, please be prepared too.

1552
01:49:11,604 --> 01:49:14,941
Choji... Shikamaru... Ino...

1553
01:49:16,033 --> 01:49:18,077
You've become fine shinobi.

1554
01:49:27,729 --> 01:49:29,105
That's all thanks to you!

1555
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:34,988
Show me what you've got,
Ino-Shika-Cho!

1556
01:49:40,951 --> 01:49:42,327
We'll cut him down in one sweep!

1557
01:49:45,355 --> 01:49:46,565
A Substitution Jutsu!

1558
01:49:46,790 --> 01:49:47,791
Run!

1559
01:49:52,546 --> 01:49:54,047
Your movements are slow, Choji!

1560
01:49:54,297 --> 01:49:55,465
Pull yourself together!

1561
01:49:55,757 --> 01:49:56,758
He's coming!

1562
01:49:59,143 --> 01:50:00,006
Shikamaru!

1563
01:50:00,031 --> 01:50:03,201
Cast your Shadow Possession
to lead me towards Choji.

1564
01:50:03,557 --> 01:50:05,016
That's just what I plan to do!

1565
01:50:05,559 --> 01:50:07,060
<i>Shadow Possession Jutsu!</i>

1566
01:50:07,563 --> 01:50:08,981
<i>One more move!</i>

1567
01:50:09,940 --> 01:50:11,358
<i>Even if it's a bluff,</i>

1568
01:50:11,383 --> 01:50:13,969
<i>if he knows Mind Transfer Jutsu,
he'll ward it off!</i>

1569
01:50:14,234 --> 01:50:16,236
<i>If he dodges the Shadow Possession
and makes a run for it,</i>

1570
01:50:16,236 --> 01:50:17,404
<i>he'll be in Ino's blind spot.</i>

1571
01:50:17,904 --> 01:50:20,115
<i>Exactly what I hoped for!
And there...</i>

1572
01:50:20,156 --> 01:50:22,033
<i>Partial Expansion Jutsu!</i>

1573
01:50:23,326 --> 01:50:24,703
<i>Checkmate, Asuma!</i>

1574
01:50:24,953 --> 01:50:26,246
Now, Choji!

1575
01:50:26,746 --> 01:50:27,956
<i>All right!</i>

1576
01:50:30,041 --> 01:50:31,585
What are you doing, Choji!

1577
01:50:31,610 --> 01:50:32,861
Snap out of it!

1578
01:50:32,943 --> 01:50:34,461
We prepared ourselves for this!

1579
01:50:35,088 --> 01:50:36,089
Choji...!

1580
01:50:36,673 --> 01:50:40,260
This is...
This is too much for me!

1581
01:50:40,302 --> 01:50:43,706
I can't take our Sensei down!

1582
01:50:43,941 --> 01:50:44,781
Choji!

1583
01:50:45,531 --> 01:50:46,362
Move!

1584
01:50:46,493 --> 01:50:47,241
<i>That's...!</i>

1585
01:50:48,226 --> 01:50:50,562
<i>Wind Style: Dust Storm Jutsu!</i>

1586
01:50:52,248 --> 01:50:52,914
Damn it!

1587
01:50:52,939 --> 01:50:53,940
<i>He countered it!</i>

1588
01:51:03,074 --> 01:51:03,992
Are you all right?!

1589
01:51:04,159 --> 01:51:05,535
Barely.

1590
01:51:06,411 --> 01:51:10,540
Why? Why does it have
to be like this?!

1591
01:51:10,915 --> 01:51:12,500
It's too late to whine!

1592
01:51:12,917 --> 01:51:15,503
We agreed to stop Asuma ourselves!

1593
01:51:16,129 --> 01:51:18,256
What's with that look
on your face, Choji?

1594
01:51:18,340 --> 01:51:20,342
Right now, I am your enemy,
plain and simple!

1595
01:51:20,383 --> 01:51:21,718
I'm already dead!

1596
01:51:21,926 --> 01:51:23,261
Don't hesitate!

1597
01:51:24,456 --> 01:51:27,959
I know. I know that, but...

1598
01:51:28,980 --> 01:51:31,137
Even back then, Sensei, you...

1599
01:51:32,570 --> 01:51:34,322
Enough is enough, fatso!

1600
01:51:34,347 --> 01:51:35,682
Just try and take me down!

1601
01:51:38,360 --> 01:51:40,111
Did you call me "fatso"?

1602
01:51:41,446 --> 01:51:44,741
You just said "fatso," right?

1603
01:51:48,411 --> 01:51:52,207
I am not... I am not fat...

1604
01:51:57,045 --> 01:51:59,889
I'm just a little chubby!

1605
01:52:22,801 --> 01:52:23,542
<i>It's no good.</i>

1606
01:52:23,567 --> 01:52:26,898
<i>Choji has totally lost his will to fight.</i>

1607
01:52:28,618 --> 01:52:30,038
Why, Choji?!

1608
01:52:35,834 --> 01:52:36,751
<i>It didn't work!</i>

1609
01:52:36,835 --> 01:52:38,795
Choji! Move away!

1610
01:52:38,795 --> 01:52:39,796
Choji!

1611
01:52:50,348 --> 01:52:53,601
<i>Ino Mind Transferred into Choji.</i>

1612
01:52:59,273 --> 01:53:00,649
That was close!

1613
01:53:00,994 --> 01:53:02,913
Thanks for the Shadow Possession,
Shikamaru!

1614
01:53:08,742 --> 01:53:09,784
<i>Ino...</i>

1615
01:53:09,784 --> 01:53:14,831
<i>We went on many missions
with Asuma-sensei as Team 10.</i>

1616
01:53:15,457 --> 01:53:16,958
<i>I know exactly how you feel.</i>

1617
01:53:25,759 --> 01:53:29,888
<i>Shikamaru and I don't want
to fight him either.</i>

1618
01:53:30,430 --> 01:53:33,767
<i>But because we know Asuma-sensei
better than anyone else,</i>

1619
01:53:34,225 --> 01:53:37,103
<i>we can stop him with the least amount
of risk to the Allied Force!</i>

1620
01:53:42,692 --> 01:53:43,777
Choji...

1621
01:53:46,488 --> 01:53:51,034
<i>Choji, you haven't forgotten what
these piercings represent, have you?!</i>

1622
01:53:56,790 --> 01:53:59,959
<i>Everyone in Team 10 is
now a Chunin.</i>

1623
01:54:01,419 --> 01:54:04,714
That means I'm no longer
in charge of you.

1624
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:08,927
Each of you will go on
to become captains

1625
01:54:08,968 --> 01:54:11,054
and eventually lead
your own teams.

1626
01:54:12,430 --> 01:54:15,892
These earrings are a gift to
celebrate your promotions.

1627
01:54:16,726 --> 01:54:20,772
Don't ever forget that the four of us
were members of Team 10!

1628
01:54:24,161 --> 01:54:25,996
And these earrings are proof

1629
01:54:26,486 --> 01:54:30,740
that you have come of age
in your respective clans.

1630
01:54:32,299 --> 01:54:36,094
Each of you knows the story behind
the Practice of the Piercings.

1631
01:54:37,038 --> 01:54:41,209
Now go, and present
your earrings to your clans.

1632
01:54:42,085 --> 01:54:44,170
And when you do,

1633
01:54:44,212 --> 01:54:46,923
you will be officially recognized
as full-fledged shinobi!

1634
01:54:47,048 --> 01:54:48,383
Now, get going!

1635
01:54:50,260 --> 01:54:52,136
<i>Full-fledged shinobi...</i>

1636
01:54:54,013 --> 01:54:56,808
<i>I... I...</i>

1637
01:54:59,510 --> 01:55:00,553
<i>Fire Style:</i>

1638
01:55:00,650 --> 01:55:02,110
<i>Burning Ash!</i>

1639
01:55:02,438 --> 01:55:03,690
Ino, Choji!

1640
01:55:06,484 --> 01:55:07,485
Choza!

1641
01:55:13,199 --> 01:55:14,200
Old Man!

1642
01:55:19,455 --> 01:55:21,457
Choji!! Snap out of it!

1643
01:55:21,749 --> 01:55:24,711
We're not brats who need
to be protected!

1644
01:55:24,752 --> 01:55:26,671
We're the ones doing the protecting!

1645
01:55:26,754 --> 01:55:29,382
Would you let Asuma kill
his own child?!

1646
01:55:30,258 --> 01:55:32,260
Your idea of kindness is wrong here!

1647
01:55:36,639 --> 01:55:38,308
<i>Shikamaru is right!</i>

1648
01:55:38,558 --> 01:55:41,227
<i>Why do you think you
have that piercing?</i>

1649
01:55:41,686 --> 01:55:43,146
Quit pouting, Choji!

1650
01:55:44,283 --> 01:55:47,244
You're the 16th head
of the Akimichi Clan!

1651
01:55:48,443 --> 01:55:50,445
<i>Akimichi Clan...</i>

1652
01:55:54,115 --> 01:55:56,743
Choza! Please come quickly!

1653
01:55:57,076 --> 01:55:58,661
Sorry, I'll be right there!

1654
01:56:00,747 --> 01:56:03,458
<i>If you are truly kind...</i>

1655
01:56:04,208 --> 01:56:07,045
<i>there is no other time like now.</i>

1656
01:56:08,463 --> 01:56:12,550
<i>Or are you merely a coward?</i>

1657
01:56:13,425 --> 01:56:15,385
Choji! It's all right!

1658
01:56:19,974 --> 01:56:22,310
From today on, you are an adult.

1659
01:56:22,578 --> 01:56:26,748
You will have a new piercing
upon which you make your vow...

1660
01:56:26,939 --> 01:56:30,943
and it will be your turn to nurture
your own child and pass on that earring.

1661
01:56:33,279 --> 01:56:34,447
What is it?

1662
01:56:35,907 --> 01:56:38,660
Do you think...
I can really get married?

1663
01:56:38,811 --> 01:56:41,898
What kind of look is that, Choji?!

1664
01:56:42,455 --> 01:56:44,374
You know what it is, right?

1665
01:56:44,415 --> 01:56:46,668
When Asuma always tells you
that you lack something.

1666
01:56:46,834 --> 01:56:49,420
Even I was able to get married.

1667
01:56:49,804 --> 01:56:51,097
Have more confidence in yourself!

1668
01:56:52,507 --> 01:56:55,343
But I might not be as lucky as you.

1669
01:56:56,177 --> 01:56:59,806
Times are different... 
And it's hard to meet girls.

1670
01:57:00,798 --> 01:57:03,175
Choji, the time has come
to make your oath!

1671
01:57:03,977 --> 01:57:05,812
You know the words, don't you?

1672
01:57:06,854 --> 01:57:08,272
Uh-huh...

1673
01:57:12,443 --> 01:57:14,779
<i>Human Boulder!</i>

1674
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:27,834
<i>I won't hand over
this last bite to anyone!</i>

1675
01:57:30,530 --> 01:57:32,282
<i>With an appetite like that,</i>

1676
01:57:32,307 --> 01:57:34,642
<i>there's no need to
worry about your body.</i>

1677
01:57:35,216 --> 01:57:40,179
<i>After I finish eating,
can you help me train, Asuma-sensei?!</i>

1678
01:57:42,890 --> 01:57:50,023
<i>Lastly, Ino, Choji, Shikamaru...</i>

1679
01:57:50,975 --> 01:57:53,943
<i>There's something I want to say.</i>

1680
01:57:57,321 --> 01:57:58,656
<i>Choji...</i>

1681
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:01,868
<i>You are kind and considerate
of your comrades.</i>

1682
01:58:03,327 --> 01:58:07,832
<i>That is why you will be stronger
than any other shinobi.</i>

1683
01:58:08,733 --> 01:58:11,819
<i>Have more confidence in yourself.</i>

1684
01:58:12,253 --> 01:58:13,504
<i>Okay.</i>

1685
01:58:14,088 --> 01:58:17,717
<i>And... you should diet a little.</i>

1686
01:58:18,176 --> 01:58:21,012
<i>I don't know if it'll work,
but I'll try my best.</i>

1687
01:58:25,141 --> 01:58:29,812
<i>I just thought that
I'd change naturally.</i>

1688
01:58:31,272 --> 01:58:36,861
<i>I thought both my heart and body
would get stronger when I got older.</i>

1689
01:58:39,197 --> 01:58:42,700
I, the 16th head of the Akimichi Clan,
hereby swear,

1690
01:58:42,742 --> 01:58:47,121
I shall pass on this oath entrusted
to me by the 15th head,

1691
01:58:48,247 --> 01:58:52,585
unto the 17th, to my future child!

1692
01:59:08,017 --> 01:59:09,894
<i>Sorry, Ino.</i>

1693
01:59:10,561 --> 01:59:13,648
<i>I'm okay now.
You can switch back.</i>

1694
01:59:16,734 --> 01:59:21,697
<i>In order to protect the Yamanaka
and Nara Clans,</i>

1695
01:59:22,045 --> 01:59:24,200
<i>and the Hidden Leaf Village...</i>

1696
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:26,452
<i>I, Choji Akimichi, swear to
transform from a caterpillar...</i>

1697
01:59:26,494 --> 01:59:28,162
<i>Into a butterfly, and take flight!</i>

1698
01:59:30,748 --> 01:59:31,791
Choji!

1699
01:59:33,918 --> 01:59:37,004
It's time to change!

1700
01:59:39,395 --> 01:59:43,177
<i>So you grew wings, Choji...
without using the pills!</i>

1701
01:59:47,223 --> 01:59:48,266
Choji!

1702
01:59:48,933 --> 01:59:50,768
That's my boy, Choji.

1703
01:59:52,645 --> 01:59:54,564
Yes! That's the look!

1704
01:59:57,275 --> 01:59:58,860
Choji's skinnier!

1705
01:59:59,610 --> 02:00:02,697
Did he take that pill
he took long ago?

1706
02:00:02,989 --> 02:00:06,367
This looks like the effects
of the Chili Pepper Pill.

1707
02:00:06,450 --> 02:00:07,577
Will he be all right?

1708
02:00:08,119 --> 02:00:09,203
He'll be fine!

1709
02:00:09,787 --> 02:00:13,166
He didn't use the Akimichi Clan's
Secret Calorie Control Technique.

1710
02:00:13,207 --> 02:00:14,876
He transformed on his own.

1711
02:00:15,543 --> 02:00:18,129
In other words, he'll have
no side effects from the pill.

1712
02:00:18,671 --> 02:00:22,383
Was the shell of the chrysalis harder
than you thought, Choji?

1713
02:00:23,414 --> 02:00:25,996
Well, you can fly now, right?

1714
02:00:29,098 --> 02:00:30,308
Oh yeah!

1715
02:00:40,693 --> 02:00:42,320
I'm going up!

1716
02:00:42,945 --> 02:00:44,197
Old man Choza!

1717
02:00:45,031 --> 02:00:47,533
I'm sorry Choji's been
such trouble!

1718
02:00:48,284 --> 02:00:50,536
But that's all over.

1719
02:00:51,037 --> 02:00:56,918
He is now worthy of being
the 16th head of the Akimichi Clan.

1720
02:01:00,421 --> 02:01:02,215
We'll deal with Asuma!

1721
02:01:02,338 --> 02:01:04,174
Please take care of the rest, old man!

1722
02:01:11,682 --> 02:01:12,767
Come get me!

1723
02:01:13,351 --> 02:01:15,668
When you've weakened him,
send him over to us!

1724
02:01:15,693 --> 02:01:18,445
You sure can bark out orders.

1725
02:01:18,564 --> 02:01:20,274
We should go and help.

1726
02:01:20,624 --> 02:01:21,709
Shut up!

1727
02:01:22,693 --> 02:01:24,070
That's the Sealing Corps!

1728
02:01:24,362 --> 02:01:25,529
Like it's that simple!

1729
02:01:27,865 --> 02:01:29,617
Shikamaru! Your back!

1730
02:01:29,617 --> 02:01:30,493
Right!

1731
02:01:30,534 --> 02:01:31,535
Go, Ino!

1732
02:01:32,078 --> 02:01:33,955
<i>Mind Transfer Clone Jutsu!</i>

1733
02:01:46,230 --> 02:01:47,564
<i>I'm up next!</i>

1734
02:01:47,885 --> 02:01:49,387
<i>Shadow Stitching Jutsu!</i>

1735
02:01:54,976 --> 02:01:57,270
There's no way to counter this.

1736
02:01:57,895 --> 02:01:59,563
Nice work, Choji!

1737
02:02:05,278 --> 02:02:07,488
<i>Choji... That's the look.</i>

1738
02:02:08,121 --> 02:02:12,410
<i>As long as you have that look, you will
be stronger than any shinobi out there.</i>

1739
02:02:13,327 --> 02:02:15,346
<i>Right now, you have
the expression of</i>

1740
02:02:15,371 --> 02:02:17,891
<i>someone who has all
the confidence he needs!</i>

1741
02:02:21,002 --> 02:02:22,044
Choji!

1742
02:02:30,136 --> 02:02:33,431
To beat me with the memento
I left you...

1743
02:02:33,826 --> 02:02:35,661
I can't move because
I'm filled with emotion.

1744
02:02:36,183 --> 02:02:38,519
I call it my Shadow Possession
Shuriken Jutsu.

1745
02:02:38,675 --> 02:02:40,385
That's why you can't move.

1746
02:02:40,649 --> 02:02:41,483
All right!

1747
02:02:41,508 --> 02:02:43,719
Leave the rest to us,
the Sealing Corps!

1748
02:02:44,516 --> 02:02:46,435
Can you wait a bit?

1749
02:02:46,746 --> 02:02:47,747
What?!

1750
02:02:48,161 --> 02:02:50,372
We already heard your last words.

1751
02:02:51,324 --> 02:02:53,993
Hearing them a second time
won't have the same impact.

1752
02:02:55,494 --> 02:03:00,166
Then let me add one thing
I couldn't tell you the last time.

1753
02:03:01,876 --> 02:03:06,172
I have nothing more to say
to you three...

1754
02:03:07,882 --> 02:03:10,551
because your Ino-Shika-Cho
formation is complete.

1755
02:03:19,649 --> 02:03:20,733
Sensei...

1756
02:03:23,147 --> 02:03:24,357
Asuma...

1757
02:03:25,316 --> 02:03:27,109
Asuma-sensei...

1758
02:03:29,111 --> 02:03:30,654
– Thank you.
– Thank you.

1759
02:03:53,094 --> 02:03:54,470
What is that?!

1760
02:04:04,855 --> 02:04:07,608
I'm ending this battle now!

1761
02:04:08,818 --> 02:04:13,030
So help me out, Shikamaru! Ino!

1762
02:04:13,489 --> 02:04:14,782
All right!

1763
02:04:14,845 --> 02:04:17,848
Choji, I've been with you
for a long time...

1764
02:04:18,285 --> 02:04:21,205
but I've never seen you
take charge!

1765
02:04:32,110 --> 02:04:33,278
– <i>Ninja Art:</i>
– <i>Ninja Art:</i>

1766
02:04:35,136 --> 02:04:36,588
– <i>Four Flames Formation!</i>
– <i>Four Flames Formation!</i>

1767
02:04:40,808 --> 02:04:41,934
Well done!

1768
02:04:42,773 --> 02:04:44,192
Once inside this barrier,

1769
02:04:44,355 --> 02:04:47,525
even those controlled by
the Reanimation Jutsu are helpless.

1770
02:04:47,814 --> 02:04:48,815
Yes...

1771
02:04:49,942 --> 02:04:50,943
Right.

1772
02:05:06,876 --> 02:05:07,877
This is...

1773
02:05:08,586 --> 02:05:09,587
the last one!

1774
02:05:15,259 --> 02:05:17,720
I'm dying. Help me...

1775
02:05:18,804 --> 02:05:20,431
You used too much chakra.

1776
02:05:21,348 --> 02:05:23,017
Don't use this ninja tool anymore!

1777
02:05:23,225 --> 02:05:26,979
But, I'm so good with it.

1778
02:05:32,916 --> 02:05:35,168
Thanks, big guy from the Leaf!

1779
02:05:38,115 --> 02:05:39,700
It's far from over.

1780
02:05:41,118 --> 02:05:43,287
This is just... the beginning.

1781
02:05:44,587 --> 02:05:46,673
That's some assessment.

1782
02:05:47,875 --> 02:05:49,835
We're the victors here.

1783
02:05:51,337 --> 02:05:53,172
We've defended
the coastline to the end.

1784
02:05:53,730 --> 02:05:56,108
Your amphibious operation
is a failure.

1785
02:06:13,551 --> 02:06:14,802
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

1786
02:06:15,930 --> 02:06:16,673
No way!

1787
02:06:47,351 --> 02:06:48,477
What is that?!

1788
02:06:48,936 --> 02:06:50,229
It's bigger than Choji.

1789
02:06:51,605 --> 02:06:53,065
I have a bad feeling about this.

1790
02:06:54,992 --> 02:06:57,286
I-It's not just big...

1791
02:06:57,820 --> 02:07:01,198
That's some assessment
on your part too.

1792
02:07:04,998 --> 02:07:06,458
Come! Choji!

1793
02:07:07,866 --> 02:07:11,244
Please deal with
Kakuzu and Hizashi!

1794
02:07:11,667 --> 02:07:13,085
I'll handle that one!

1795
02:07:15,170 --> 02:07:16,005
Sealing Corps!

1796
02:07:16,171 --> 02:07:18,674
Go, Gedo Statue!

1797
02:07:27,864 --> 02:07:29,032
<i>It's there, eh...</i>

1798
02:07:43,449 --> 02:07:44,867
Now, Choji!

1799
02:07:54,126 --> 02:07:55,127
<i>He stopped me?!</i>

1800
02:07:56,211 --> 02:07:57,463
What happened?

1801
02:08:07,056 --> 02:08:08,349
What's happening up there?!

1802
02:08:14,104 --> 02:08:15,481
I can't believe this.

1803
02:08:24,615 --> 02:08:25,658
Get back!

1804
02:08:26,158 --> 02:08:27,951
Everyone, retreat to
the coastline!

1805
02:08:30,579 --> 02:08:32,498
<i>Earth Style: Mountain Jutsu!</i>

1806
02:09:01,902 --> 02:09:03,404
What is that thing?

1807
02:09:03,612 --> 02:09:07,116
What power... It's overwhelming!

1808
02:09:07,533 --> 02:09:11,412
Taking into consideration
all the data gathered so far,

1809
02:09:11,453 --> 02:09:14,248
and the data Temari of the Sand
gave to the Allied Forces Council,

1810
02:09:14,289 --> 02:09:15,457
I wonder if that's...

1811
02:09:23,679 --> 02:09:24,494
Why you—!

1812
02:09:27,553 --> 02:09:28,554
Damn it!

1813
02:09:32,224 --> 02:09:34,017
You can't have that ninja tool!

1814
02:09:35,102 --> 02:09:36,478
I don't want the ninja tool!

1815
02:09:36,895 --> 02:09:39,356
I want what's inside.

1816
02:09:39,857 --> 02:09:41,817
I'll return the ninja tool later.

1817
02:09:42,109 --> 02:09:43,610
If you want it that badly.

1818
02:09:47,281 --> 02:09:50,398
You used the Gold and Silver Brothers,

1819
02:09:50,423 --> 02:09:53,370
who possess the Nine-Tails' chakra,
by deploying them to the front lines.

1820
02:09:53,370 --> 02:09:55,372
Now that you're through with them,

1821
02:09:55,414 --> 02:09:59,585
you want to seal their chakra
inside that statue...

1822
02:10:00,753 --> 02:10:04,673
Seems the Allied Forces have
a shrewd one in their midst.

1823
02:10:05,465 --> 02:10:06,508
Am I wrong?

1824
02:10:07,843 --> 02:10:11,930
What a shame
that you're my enemy.

1825
02:10:12,322 --> 02:10:14,241
Don't tell me that giant is...

1826
02:10:14,683 --> 02:10:15,684
No way...

1827
02:10:25,805 --> 02:10:26,678
Damn it!

1828
02:10:33,082 --> 02:10:34,083
Shikamaru?!

1829
02:10:43,587 --> 02:10:45,297
Are you all right, Shikamaru?

1830
02:10:46,006 --> 02:10:47,800
You're a lifesaver, Choji!

1831
02:10:49,176 --> 02:10:51,178
Sorry to bother you twice.

1832
02:10:51,678 --> 02:10:52,805
Don't stress over it.

1833
02:10:53,274 --> 02:10:54,400
I apologize.

1834
02:10:55,232 --> 02:10:56,840
So what happened to him?

1835
02:10:58,560 --> 02:11:00,229
He disappeared with
the ninja tool.

1836
02:11:12,574 --> 02:11:13,867
They retreated?

1837
02:11:40,401 --> 02:11:41,819
Choza, seal me!

1838
02:11:42,437 --> 02:11:45,399
Hurry...
Hurry and seal me!
