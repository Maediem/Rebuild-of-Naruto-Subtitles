1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:05,880
Naruto, Hinata,
congratulations on your marriage!

2
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:07,880
Huh?

3
00:00:09,102 --> 00:00:09,786
Oh!

4
00:00:10,414 --> 00:00:12,124
What're you doing, Sai?

5
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:13,972
Where's your congratulatory message?!

6
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:17,733
Well, I don't think I can say it well.

7
00:00:17,758 --> 00:00:19,760
You're a former Team 7 member!

8
00:00:20,107 --> 00:00:21,212
You're gonna do this!

9
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:25,466
Naruto, Hinata, congratulations
on your marriage!

10
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:27,329
Hey, you're being too stiff…

11
00:00:27,793 --> 00:00:30,447
Naruto, Hinata, congratulations
on your marriage!

12
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,699
Uh, act more natural.

13
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:36,036
Like I told you before,
I don't think I can say it well.

14
00:00:39,577 --> 00:00:40,995
Naruto! Hinata!

15
00:00:41,193 --> 00:00:45,414
To the both of you...
Have a hot, hot, hot married life!

16
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:46,668
Brother Lee, you're way too close…

17
00:00:46,862 --> 00:00:50,199
When you say it, it doesn't sound
like a congratulatory message…

18
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,551
Something's missing!

19
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,342
Guy Sensei!

20
00:00:53,726 --> 00:00:54,669
My dear Lee…

21
00:00:55,072 --> 00:00:57,111
Think if your hot-blooded wish
will permeate through the lens

22
00:00:57,136 --> 00:00:59,192
and be conveyed 100% to
Naruto and Hinata

23
00:00:59,318 --> 00:01:02,572
when your message is played.

24
00:01:03,444 --> 00:01:07,235
It needs something
symbolic on-screen.

25
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,277
I know! The sunrise!

26
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,205
The sun rising over the horizon

27
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,440
to mark the beginning of
their married life together!

28
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,575
Give your message with
the sunrise in the background…

29
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,102
and you'll increase the impact of
your hot-blooded feelings by 300%!

30
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,163
Don't take them too seriously.

31
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:23,583
Hi Naruto and Hinata!
I hope you're well!

32
00:01:23,618 --> 00:01:25,078
What's up with that?

33
00:01:25,103 --> 00:01:26,771
Of course, they're well.

34
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:29,101
Hey, enough with the wisecracks!

35
00:01:30,331 --> 00:01:31,374
Tadah!

36
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:33,026
Hey Naruto! Hinata!

37
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,195
How ya doin'?

38
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,551
Hey Kiba! Don't butt in!

39
00:01:36,715 --> 00:01:38,717
– Isn't there anyone who's a friend of
– I heard you were making

40
00:01:38,922 --> 00:01:40,406
– Big Brother Naruto who'll let me
– a congratulatory video!

41
00:01:40,431 --> 00:01:42,142
– get a proper message?
– I searched for you all over town!

42
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:47,065
Uh, Naruto, Hinata…
congratulations on your marriage...

43
00:01:47,113 --> 00:01:49,657
Iruka Sensei, you're too nervous, c'mon!

44
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:52,752
Sorry, sorry! I'm not good
at these sorts of things.

45
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:55,462
Just say what you feel.

46
00:01:55,888 --> 00:01:58,390
If he hears his mentor, Iruka Sensei,
speaking from his heart…

47
00:01:58,419 --> 00:02:00,963
Big Bro Naruto's gonna cry!

48
00:02:01,269 --> 00:02:03,979
His mentor?
That's going a bit too far.

49
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:07,150
Okay, let's go for a comment
that's deeply moving! Here we go!

50
00:02:07,242 --> 00:02:10,579
Ah...Um...Well…

51
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:15,176
I can't think of anything so suddenly,
so can we do this later?

52
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:22,035
<i>Since Naruto's getting married…</i>

53
00:03:54,661 --> 00:03:56,162
Naruto, Hinata…

54
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:58,831
Naruto! Hinata!

55
00:04:00,424 --> 00:04:02,802
Congratulations on your nuptials…

56
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:05,210
That's too stiff!

57
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,162
Iruka Sensei!

58
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,288
Big trouble!

59
00:04:09,974 --> 00:04:12,310
Look at what they did
to the memorial statue!

60
00:04:12,705 --> 00:04:13,706
What do we do?

61
00:04:14,148 --> 00:04:17,882
Now, Sadoru Sensei,
you just became an instructor recently,

62
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,759
so I understand how upsetting this is.

63
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,970
But this sort of thing is quite minor…

64
00:04:23,236 --> 00:04:24,195
Hey!

65
00:04:27,287 --> 00:04:29,373
Tsukune, Sansho, Mibuna!

66
00:04:29,589 --> 00:04:31,971
So, this is your doing, after all.

67
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:34,738
How'd you know we were here?

68
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,735
I know exactly what you're thinking.

69
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,428
We were just playing hide-and-seek!

70
00:04:39,642 --> 00:04:41,603
Don't go off and treat us like criminals!

71
00:04:41,694 --> 00:04:42,695
Don't lie!

72
00:04:43,221 --> 00:04:46,846
I bet you enjoyed seeing Sadoru Sensei
having a hard time, didn't you?

73
00:04:46,873 --> 00:04:47,916
No!

74
00:04:47,998 --> 00:04:50,667
You don't even like, have any proof.
So, stop jumping to conclusions!

75
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:51,724
I see.

76
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:54,668
So, you guys didn't do this graffiti…

77
00:04:54,797 --> 00:04:58,801
For a prank, it looked pretty cool,
so I figured it was you guys…

78
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,717
Hey, you've got a good eye!

79
00:05:00,998 --> 00:05:02,941
To tell you the truth,
I'm really proud of it!

80
00:05:02,966 --> 00:05:03,967
Shh!

81
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,558
Make sure you clean it up completely!

82
00:05:08,648 --> 00:05:10,184
– Yes, sir…
– Yes, sir…

83
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,153
You're amazing, Iruka Sensei!

84
00:05:12,685 --> 00:05:16,939
Compared to Naruto's antics,
this is cute.

85
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,526
Naruto?

86
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:20,995
You mean, Naruto Uzumaki?

87
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,991
Were you his teacher?

88
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,827
Huh? Well, yes…

89
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,871
– No way!
– No way!

90
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:33,183
Naruto Uzumaki, the super-famous
Naruto Uzumaki, right?

91
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,667
He's on a completely different level!

92
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,670
There's no way an ordinary teacher

93
00:05:36,695 --> 00:05:38,979
– like you taught him, Iruka Sensei!
– Ordinary…teacher?

94
00:05:39,692 --> 00:05:41,652
You're just trying to inspire us…

95
00:05:41,677 --> 00:05:43,634
by saying that even
Naruto Uzumaki was a bad kid,

96
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:45,844
so us bad kids should
try our best, right?

97
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,349
Yeah, like, don't make up stories
if you want to send us a message.

98
00:05:49,487 --> 00:05:50,822
I-I see…

99
00:05:51,192 --> 00:05:52,845
Well then…

100
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,314
While you're at it, rake the yard
and clean the toilets!

101
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,838
– What?!
– What?!

102
00:05:58,007 --> 00:05:59,968
– No fair!
– No fair!

103
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,824
<i>"I really did teach Naruto."</i>

104
00:06:07,037 --> 00:06:11,079
<i>Even if I said that,
students now wouldn't believe me.</i>

105
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:16,667
<i>Naruto is a super-hero to them.</i>

106
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,879
Oh, there you are!

107
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,079
Iruka Sensei, do you have a minute?

108
00:06:24,764 --> 00:06:25,473
Yes?

109
00:06:25,836 --> 00:06:28,486
Vice-principal? Me?!

110
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:31,372
You've been here a long time.

111
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,131
And you're popular
among your colleagues.

112
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,564
You would be perfect person
for the job.

113
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,699
Lord Kakashi,
I've brought you some tea.

114
00:06:48,853 --> 00:06:51,272
Can you drop the "lord"?

115
00:06:51,469 --> 00:06:53,054
Is anything the matter, sir?

116
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,289
You seem quite perturbed.

117
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,708
And don't be overly formal.

118
00:06:58,135 --> 00:06:59,166
I'm not used to it.

119
00:07:01,182 --> 00:07:05,436
Anyway, the date for Naruto and
Hinata's wedding is set, right?

120
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:09,178
I'm thinking of a way for
everyone to be able to attend.

121
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,847
I see…

122
00:07:11,173 --> 00:07:13,299
If everyone attends the reception,

123
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:15,768
we won't be able to fulfill
any missions on that day…

124
00:07:16,032 --> 00:07:19,647
let alone handle any emergencies.

125
00:07:20,445 --> 00:07:25,116
Their close circle of friends are
all significant jonin now, right?

126
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,573
It would be a problem if
all of them are unavailable.

127
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,430
Naruto, it's been awhile.

128
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:33,679
I hear you're getting married—

129
00:07:34,051 --> 00:07:35,052
That's right!

130
00:07:35,184 --> 00:07:36,539
The previous Hokage, Lady Tsunade,

131
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,543
had a rule in case
of emergencies like this.

132
00:07:40,885 --> 00:07:41,574
Huh?!

133
00:07:42,344 --> 00:07:44,865
"One: when there is
a marriage among shinobi,

134
00:07:45,012 --> 00:07:47,733
the gift that each shinobi
will present will be assessed

135
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:51,554
to determine who shall attend,"
it seems…

136
00:07:51,761 --> 00:07:54,198
Huh?! What's up with that?
It's got to be a joke.

137
00:07:54,269 --> 00:07:56,855
It seems like a joke,
but it's right here.

138
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,478
You're right!

139
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:05,007
But this is like eliminating people
by the size of their gift.

140
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:08,529
Perhaps so, but it's the rule.

141
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,284
No one would agree to something
that measures friendship like that.

142
00:08:13,718 --> 00:08:16,596
I'll be called
the worst Hokage in history.

143
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,902
I understand how you feel,

144
00:08:18,927 --> 00:08:21,125
but it's more important
to fulfill the responsibility

145
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,651
that's right before you,
as the Hokage.

146
00:08:25,282 --> 00:08:26,158
Welcome!

147
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,576
I'll have ramen.

148
00:08:27,601 --> 00:08:29,436
Make mine a super-size ramen!

149
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,136
Oh! Iruka Sensei!

150
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:35,604
Did you come up with
a congratulatory message?

151
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:38,912
Uh no, sorry, I forgot…

152
00:08:40,829 --> 00:08:42,371
An advancement exam?!

153
00:08:42,545 --> 00:08:46,232
One of the board officials recommended
I take it to become vice-principal.

154
00:08:46,257 --> 00:08:49,749
W-Wh…? Why only Iruka Sensei?

155
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:52,131
Does that mean
I'm not among the candidates?!

156
00:08:52,328 --> 00:08:53,978
No, that's not right!

157
00:08:54,254 --> 00:08:55,755
What's the matter, Ebisu Sensei?

158
00:08:56,434 --> 00:08:58,454
N-No, nothing's the matter.

159
00:08:58,911 --> 00:09:01,164
But this is a great opportunity!

160
00:09:01,631 --> 00:09:02,375
Oh?

161
00:09:02,865 --> 00:09:04,560
His mentor is being promoted…

162
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:07,613
This will make Naruto's wedding
even more auspicious.

163
00:09:07,776 --> 00:09:11,234
Then we'll have to start
calling you Vice-Principal Iruka.

164
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,468
Oh, please stop.

165
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,227
I haven't even decided
if I'll take the test or not.

166
00:09:16,414 --> 00:09:17,114
Huh?!

167
00:09:17,322 --> 00:09:19,742
You're not going to pass up
a chance like this, are you?!

168
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:22,762
Ebisu Sensei, you look sorta glad.

169
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:27,669
I admit I'm grateful for the chance
to be promoted. Besides…

170
00:09:28,113 --> 00:09:30,756
<i>Naruto Uzumaki, the super-famous
Naruto Uzumaki, right?</i>

171
00:09:30,781 --> 00:09:34,284
<i>There's no way an ordinary teacher
like you taught him, Iruka Sensei!</i>

172
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:37,510
I know I should strive to get ahead.

173
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:44,559
But there's a part of me that wants
to continue teaching kids one on one.

174
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:46,322
Of course!

175
00:09:46,347 --> 00:09:50,053
You shine in the classroom,
Iruka Sensei. You really do!

176
00:09:50,213 --> 00:09:52,715
I still think you seem a little too happy…

177
00:09:54,109 --> 00:09:55,861
What's up?

178
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,492
Lord Kakashi…

179
00:10:01,754 --> 00:10:03,911
Could you drop the "lord" part?

180
00:10:04,254 --> 00:10:06,920
How long have you been there?
I didn't notice you at all.

181
00:10:07,127 --> 00:10:10,625
Well, you were all going on
about Iruka Sensei…

182
00:10:10,718 --> 00:10:12,370
So, I didn't want to interfere.

183
00:10:12,563 --> 00:10:13,421
Lord Kakashi…

184
00:10:13,664 --> 00:10:15,396
I mean, Kakashi…

185
00:10:15,421 --> 00:10:17,101
Is something going on
with you as well?

186
00:10:17,214 --> 00:10:17,967
Oh, no…

187
00:10:18,304 --> 00:10:20,431
But what's going on with you,
Iruka Sensei?

188
00:10:20,456 --> 00:10:24,056
He was asked to take
the advancement exam for vice-principal!

189
00:10:24,454 --> 00:10:25,141
Vice-principal?

190
00:10:25,816 --> 00:10:28,277
Oh yeah, the position is open.

191
00:10:28,974 --> 00:10:33,103
And I'm not sure if
I should take it or not.

192
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,180
You? Take the advancement exam?

193
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:39,137
Now that would be difficult.

194
00:10:39,162 --> 00:10:40,414
– Huh?
– What?!

195
00:10:41,384 --> 00:10:43,803
Well...I'd better get back to work.

196
00:10:45,004 --> 00:10:46,005
Thanks!

197
00:10:46,034 --> 00:10:47,118
Thanks for coming—

198
00:10:47,302 --> 00:10:48,839
Hey, Ayame.

199
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,034
Did you take Lord Kakashi's order?

200
00:10:51,153 --> 00:10:51,684
What?

201
00:10:52,075 --> 00:10:54,462
Huh?! When did he—?!

202
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,697
What's going on here?

203
00:10:56,964 --> 00:11:00,468
Was he talking about Iruka Sensei
taking the advancement exam?

204
00:11:00,746 --> 00:11:03,165
Why'd he say it would "be difficult"
for Iruka Sensei?

205
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,058
I got it!

206
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:08,542
As the Hokage, Lord Kakashi
doesn't think

207
00:11:08,723 --> 00:11:12,520
Iruka Sensei is suitable to be
the vice-principal!

208
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:13,814
– Whaa—?!
– Whaa—?!

209
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,633
That's what he meant.

210
00:11:16,107 --> 00:11:17,525
<i>The advancement exam?</i>

211
00:11:17,784 --> 00:11:19,028
<i>Iruka Sensei?</i>

212
00:11:19,409 --> 00:11:22,324
<i>Even if he takes it, with Iruka's
Sensei's skills and experience,</i>

213
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:25,907
<i>getting the promotion
would be difficult.</i>

214
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:29,666
Now, now I didn't say it!

215
00:11:29,691 --> 00:11:33,203
I'm just surmising what
Lord Hokage meant.

216
00:11:33,469 --> 00:11:38,446
For him to say that taking
the exam would be difficult…

217
00:11:38,506 --> 00:11:39,822
It's like saying he knows
the outcome

218
00:11:39,847 --> 00:11:42,350
before Iruka Sensei
even takes the exam, hey…

219
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:44,929
You gonna stand for that, Iruka Sensei?

220
00:11:45,349 --> 00:11:49,353
You want to give Naruto something else
to celebrate at his wedding, don't ya?

221
00:11:49,378 --> 00:11:51,422
Dad, don't egg him on like that.

222
00:11:51,447 --> 00:11:53,491
What're you saying?
Earlier, even you were—!

223
00:11:53,686 --> 00:11:54,687
I'm taking it!

224
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:59,368
I'm going to take the exam
and I'm going to pass.

225
00:12:00,141 --> 00:12:02,885
It will be Naruto's biggest day
in his life…

226
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:05,564
and I'm going to present him
with auspicious news!

227
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:06,968
Iruka Sensei!

228
00:12:07,037 --> 00:12:07,871
Well said!

229
00:12:07,896 --> 00:12:09,940
You're the man!

230
00:12:18,266 --> 00:12:19,267
All right!

231
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,746
A prank like this is old news.

232
00:12:27,771 --> 00:12:30,691
But Naruto, who used
to play tricks like this,

233
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:32,634
became the village hero.

234
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:37,423
Maybe there's a future
"Naruto Uzumaki" among you.

235
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:42,261
Now listen, anyone can become
a hero like Naruto Uzumaki!

236
00:12:43,034 --> 00:12:46,531
So believe in yourself
and do your best!

237
00:12:47,011 --> 00:12:48,222
– Yes, sir!
– Yes, sir!

238
00:12:48,247 --> 00:12:49,999
<i>Not Naruto Uzumaki again?!</i>

239
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,357
What's the matter?!

240
00:12:55,989 --> 00:12:58,076
Come on, put some more spirit into it!

241
00:13:01,744 --> 00:13:03,507
Sadoru Sensei,
you just have to be confident and

242
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,256
take on the students head on
at times like this!

243
00:13:05,281 --> 00:13:06,741
– I'm sorry.
– I'm sorry.

244
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,868
We're very sorry.

245
00:13:09,306 --> 00:13:11,056
I'll make sure to
teach them better

246
00:13:11,354 --> 00:13:15,776
so that this never
happens again, so please…

247
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,469
Hey, Tsukune…

248
00:13:23,843 --> 00:13:26,680
Damaging the statue is going too far.

249
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:29,333
Iruka Sensei will really
get mad this time.

250
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,392
So what?

251
00:13:37,846 --> 00:13:40,348
I figured you were up
to something like this.

252
00:13:41,097 --> 00:13:42,444
I told you, didn't I?

253
00:13:42,469 --> 00:13:45,764
I know exactly what you're thinking.

254
00:13:47,656 --> 00:13:48,745
I'll say this…

255
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:51,064
you do things on such a small scale.

256
00:13:52,114 --> 00:13:54,179
Why, to Naruto, scrawling graffiti

257
00:13:54,204 --> 00:13:56,439
on the Hokage's Great Stone Face
was nothing.

258
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,963
He even took the Book of Seals and

259
00:13:59,074 --> 00:14:01,493
wreaked havoc in the village.

260
00:14:02,546 --> 00:14:05,904
So, Naruto Uzumaki really
was your pupil?

261
00:14:06,332 --> 00:14:07,212
Shut up!

262
00:14:07,237 --> 00:14:08,238
Who cares about Naruto!

263
00:14:08,635 --> 00:14:09,959
I am me!

264
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,159
Iruka Sensei did?

265
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:14,299
Yeah.

266
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,605
He's been gung-ho ever since.

267
00:14:16,736 --> 00:14:19,113
I keep hearing good things
about him from everyone.

268
00:14:19,175 --> 00:14:21,386
He's gonna make it for sure!

269
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,906
Ebisu Sensei, you're looking
a little too depressed now.

270
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,159
I'm going out to get a bite to eat.

271
00:14:29,544 --> 00:14:31,245
Ramen again?

272
00:14:31,446 --> 00:14:34,957
Eating ramen every day isn't healthy.

273
00:14:34,982 --> 00:14:36,108
Well, that's okay.

274
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:38,248
You're really gonna do it?

275
00:14:38,406 --> 00:14:39,448
'Course!

276
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,882
Lord Hokage is gone.
Now's our only chance.

277
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:47,720
I can pull off anything
Naruto Uzumaki did, just as easily.

278
00:14:48,286 --> 00:14:49,077
Let's go!

279
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,432
C-Count me out!

280
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,433
Me too!

281
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,393
Wimps…

282
00:14:55,886 --> 00:14:56,769
Good evening.

283
00:14:56,982 --> 00:14:59,401
Oh welcome, Lord Hokage!

284
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,318
Look, could you please drop the "lord."

285
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,738
Huh? What's wrong Ebisu Sensei?
Why are you spaced out?

286
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:10,159
We were talking about Iruka Sensei
passing the advancement exam.

287
00:15:10,524 --> 00:15:13,803
Huh? Iruka Sensei plans
to take the exam?

288
00:15:14,128 --> 00:15:17,616
Sure, thanks to you, Kakashi!

289
00:15:17,913 --> 00:15:20,332
Me? What did I do?

290
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,477
Anyway…

291
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,775
What a delicious smell!

292
00:15:25,061 --> 00:15:26,270
Is it ramen?

293
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,386
Seems like they didn't
order pot stickers, though.

294
00:15:30,206 --> 00:15:32,208
Is that what happened?

295
00:15:33,573 --> 00:15:36,367
I didn't mean it that way.

296
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,062
What do you mean?

297
00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:40,981
Anyway, regarding
the advancement exam, they say…

298
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:41,950
Lord Kakashi!

299
00:15:42,178 --> 00:15:44,638
How many times do I have tell you
to stop it with the "lord"?

300
00:15:44,663 --> 00:15:46,581
Never mind that! Bad news!

301
00:15:47,205 --> 00:15:49,217
The Book of Seals was stolen?!

302
00:15:49,337 --> 00:15:52,576
Yes. No one knows where it is,

303
00:15:52,601 --> 00:15:55,270
and all shinobi are
now searching for it.

304
00:15:55,572 --> 00:15:56,430
<i>Don't tell me…</i>

305
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,650
Iruka Sensei!

306
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:04,997
Sansho! Mibuna!

307
00:16:05,462 --> 00:16:06,840
Where is Tsukune?!

308
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,869
We tried to stop him…

309
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,220
<i>I knew it…</i>

310
00:16:18,525 --> 00:16:19,734
See?

311
00:16:20,595 --> 00:16:22,013
That was easy.

312
00:16:23,013 --> 00:16:26,391
Next, I'll use this and mess up
the Great Stone Face.

313
00:16:26,604 --> 00:16:27,366
Stop!

314
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,572
I knew I'd find you here.

315
00:16:31,528 --> 00:16:33,700
You planned to use a Shadow Clone
from the Book of Seals

316
00:16:34,138 --> 00:16:36,432
and pull off a flashy prank, right?

317
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:40,290
You wanna say that you know
exactly what I'm thinking, right?

318
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,752
No, I don't know
what you're thinking.

319
00:16:45,008 --> 00:16:47,423
What am I doing?!

320
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,570
I keep comparing students
to the ones I had in the past.

321
00:16:51,018 --> 00:16:53,134
And I can't see into the heart…

322
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:56,407
of the precious student
that's standing right before me!

323
00:16:57,763 --> 00:16:59,056
Iruka Sensei…

324
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,146
I realize it now, Tsukune.

325
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,191
You just wanted to
be acknowledged, right?

326
00:17:07,399 --> 00:17:08,817
And I didn't see that…

327
00:17:08,867 --> 00:17:11,327
and kept bragging about
an old student of mine.

328
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,282
How long have I been
a teacher anyway?

329
00:17:14,406 --> 00:17:16,028
I'm such a fool!

330
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,048
I'm sorry!

331
00:17:18,517 --> 00:17:19,747
Please forgive me!

332
00:17:22,412 --> 00:17:23,417
Did you mean it?

333
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:24,346
Huh?

334
00:17:24,905 --> 00:17:27,032
About what you said…

335
00:17:27,617 --> 00:17:31,037
<i>Anyone can become a hero
like Naruto Uzumaki!</i>

336
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:34,887
<i>So believe in yourself
and do your best!</i>

337
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,473
Yeah. Of course!

338
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:40,622
'Kay then…

339
00:17:41,314 --> 00:17:44,396
I'll try a little bit harder.

340
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:50,277
I'm very sorry about what my student did.

341
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:52,870
I take full responsibility.

342
00:17:53,128 --> 00:17:53,962
Oh, yeah?

343
00:17:54,343 --> 00:17:57,701
Then check and confirm
the inside for me.

344
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:58,535
Huh?

345
00:17:59,229 --> 00:18:04,511
"To me, love is life.
Love is everything, you see?!"

346
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,169
There's no way
I'd place the real thing

347
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:10,042
where it can be stolen easily.

348
00:18:10,606 --> 00:18:11,602
True…

349
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,933
By the way, Iruka Sensei…

350
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,133
About the advancement exam…

351
00:18:16,158 --> 00:18:18,536
You were right, Kakashi.

352
00:18:18,819 --> 00:18:20,843
That position is far more than
I can handle right now.

353
00:18:21,013 --> 00:18:21,556
Huh?!

354
00:18:21,952 --> 00:18:25,873
No, no...When I said
it was going to be difficult,

355
00:18:25,996 --> 00:18:27,515
I meant that
the advancement exam

356
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,502
is on the same day
as Naruto's wedding.

357
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:31,280
What?

358
00:18:32,143 --> 00:18:33,561
You are his mentor, Iruka Sensei…

359
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:36,481
You can't miss his wedding, right?

360
00:18:37,162 --> 00:18:39,663
So, that got me thinking…

361
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,872
I'm thinking of reserving another
extra day for the advancement exam.

362
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,460
I really want you to become
the vice-principal, Iruka Sensei,

363
00:18:48,574 --> 00:18:51,078
and serve as a shining example
to all of the Academy teachers.

364
00:18:51,103 --> 00:18:52,104
I'm sorry.

365
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,050
I'm not going to take
the exam, after all.

366
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:58,262
I got carried away about
going to Naruto's reception

367
00:18:58,477 --> 00:18:59,981
as the newly promoted vice-principal

368
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:03,218
and forgot about my student
who was right before my eyes.

369
00:19:04,228 --> 00:19:06,022
I've failed as a teacher.

370
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:10,190
I have no right to
go celebrate with Naruto.

371
00:19:12,766 --> 00:19:14,807
First, I must take care
of my current students

372
00:19:15,358 --> 00:19:18,528
and cherish the things right
before me.

373
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:22,046
Then and only then,
can I properly congratulate Naruto.

374
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:27,332
Cherish the things
right before me, huh…

375
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:30,726
<i>…it's more important to
fulfill the responsibility</i>

376
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:32,502
<i>that's right before you,
as the Hokage.</i>

377
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,508
You're right. I've decided too.

378
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,219
Huh? What did you—?

379
00:19:41,762 --> 00:19:43,442
I asked you to assemble here today

380
00:19:44,129 --> 00:19:47,882
to relay something as
your Sixth Hokage.

381
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:52,979
Listen. I am giving you
a secret mission

382
00:19:53,004 --> 00:19:55,625
in which you shall each prepare
a congratulatory gift

383
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,235
for Naruto and Hinata's wedding.

384
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:03,619
Have it ready and report back
one week before the reception.

385
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:06,038
A wedding gift?

386
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,764
That's great!

387
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:09,544
– He has it all planned.
– What a drag.

388
00:20:09,569 --> 00:20:11,435
Leave it to Lord Hokage!

389
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,180
That is all.

390
00:20:14,988 --> 00:20:17,559
Kakashi, what is going on?

391
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:22,446
We're going to assess each gift
and give it a ranking to determine

392
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,565
who will attend the wedding reception

393
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,009
and who will be placed on duty
for that day's missions.

394
00:20:27,612 --> 00:20:31,070
In other words, we're going to sift
and screen through the gifts.

395
00:20:31,095 --> 00:20:36,562
But that's like measuring
their friendship?!

396
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:37,766
Yeah…

397
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:41,615
But what's most important is
what's right before me, right?

398
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:46,086
I'm prepared to be called
the worst Hokage in history.

399
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,248
"The worst Hokage in history"?

400
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,751
It's all thanks to you, Iruka Sensei!

401
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:54,790
Wha—?

402
00:20:55,377 --> 00:20:56,672
What?!

403
00:20:59,573 --> 00:21:01,936
A mission to find
a wedding present, huh?

404
00:21:02,157 --> 00:21:05,888
The Hokage is giving us a wonderful
opportunity to find a great gift…

405
00:21:05,913 --> 00:21:08,541
…that personifies our friendship.

406
00:21:08,944 --> 00:21:12,197
That's right, we've never had
a wedding celebration like this.

407
00:21:12,222 --> 00:21:13,848
– Well, they are the first
– Hey, Shino! Cut it out!

408
00:21:13,848 --> 00:21:15,183
– among all our friends
– I didn't say anything until now,

409
00:21:15,225 --> 00:21:16,851
– to get married.
– but I've had enough of

410
00:21:16,851 --> 00:21:18,186
– We gotta do our best to find
– your insect antics!

411
00:21:18,228 --> 00:21:20,021
– something they'll both like.
– Hey, Akamaru!

412
00:21:20,176 --> 00:21:22,261
Me too! I'm getting fired up!

413
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:25,485
I'm gonna make sure
they definitely love my gift!

414
00:21:25,902 --> 00:21:28,029
Do you know what
you're getting already, Lee?

415
00:21:28,196 --> 00:21:29,405
I haven't a clue.

416
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:30,417
Huh?!

417
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,201
However! If I put myself
in Naruto's shoes

418
00:21:33,284 --> 00:21:35,954
and think about how he feels,
I know it'll come to me naturally.

419
00:21:36,423 --> 00:21:39,071
I won't lose to anyone!

420
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,961
Wake up, Akamaru!

421
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:48,024
Usually, you don't compete
with wedding gifts

422
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:49,717
to see who wins or loses…

423
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:51,952
Well then…

424
00:21:53,347 --> 00:21:54,293
Let's give it our all!

425
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:56,266
This is for Hinata.

426
00:21:56,467 --> 00:21:58,243
Let's all put
our best effort into this.

427
00:21:58,381 --> 00:21:59,799
There's no need to
get so worked up.

428
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:02,272
The reason is, if you just
let it come naturally to you,

429
00:22:02,355 --> 00:22:03,982
you'll think of something.

430
00:22:04,065 --> 00:22:06,985
It seems everyone got
really fired up about this.

431
00:22:06,985 --> 00:22:08,945
I can't think of anything.

432
00:22:09,282 --> 00:22:10,242
What about you, Choji?

433
00:22:10,267 --> 00:22:13,062
I have a pretty good idea.

434
00:22:13,923 --> 00:22:16,968
Damn it...What a drag.

435
00:22:24,252 --> 00:22:27,338
<i>We're going to assess each gift
and give it a ranking</i>

436
00:22:27,363 --> 00:22:29,823
<i>to determine who will attend
the wedding reception</i>

437
00:22:29,924 --> 00:22:32,176
<i>and who will be placed on duty
for that day's missions.</i>

438
00:22:32,427 --> 00:22:35,471
<i>In other words, we're going to sift
and screen through the gifts.</i>

439
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:38,683
<i>I'd better not mention
any of that to anyone.</i>

440
00:22:41,644 --> 00:22:42,645
Hello!

441
00:22:42,979 --> 00:22:44,814
Oh, it's Lee!

442
00:22:45,648 --> 00:22:48,651
I'll have an order of the ramen
Naruto orders most often!

443
00:22:49,026 --> 00:22:50,843
Naruto's favorite ramen?

444
00:22:51,285 --> 00:22:52,146
Let's see…

445
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:55,633
That's so obvious! It's our large
miso and char siu ramen.

446
00:22:55,658 --> 00:22:57,381
– Oh, yeah that's right!
– I see!

447
00:22:57,577 --> 00:22:59,070
But why the sudden curiosity?

448
00:22:59,095 --> 00:23:01,419
If I'm to understand
Naruto's feelings,

449
00:23:01,664 --> 00:23:04,751
I figured I should first try
the things he likes to eat.

450
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:08,004
I don't get it but…
anyways, take a seat.

451
00:23:08,129 --> 00:23:08,825
Okay!

452
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:13,512
Idiot…idiot…

453
00:23:14,807 --> 00:23:15,605
How is it?

454
00:23:18,989 --> 00:23:21,409
It's delicious!
Light, yet rich, but not too heavy.

455
00:23:21,434 --> 00:23:22,919
It has volume and punch,
and its impact is so great,

456
00:23:22,944 --> 00:23:24,404
you want to slurp it down
all at once!

457
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:27,357
So…do you know how Naruto feels
a little more now?

458
00:23:28,856 --> 00:23:31,943
I understand why he always
orders this ramen!

459
00:23:32,381 --> 00:23:34,216
But other than that, no.

460
00:23:34,408 --> 00:23:35,826
I guess not.

461
00:23:36,007 --> 00:23:38,165
If you could tell how a guy feels
just by eating ramen,

462
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:40,025
life wouldn't be so hard.

463
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:41,079
Oh!

464
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,701
Iruka Sensei,
you were Naruto's teacher.

465
00:23:43,726 --> 00:23:45,228
You must know.

466
00:23:46,101 --> 00:23:47,602
Iruka Sensei?!

467
00:23:47,627 --> 00:23:50,838
I'm sorry, I was deep in thought
and didn't notice you!

468
00:23:50,938 --> 00:23:51,981
Don't worry.

469
00:23:52,048 --> 00:23:55,512
You're Lee, right?
Guy Sensei's student.

470
00:23:55,729 --> 00:24:01,861
Yes! You were Naruto's teacher…
So you must know how Naruto thinks.

471
00:24:01,991 --> 00:24:03,826
Please tell me about him!

472
00:24:03,851 --> 00:24:06,729
Well, I was his teacher
a long time ago.

473
00:24:06,961 --> 00:24:09,236
And he's become
so praiseworthy now…

474
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:12,068
I only see him once in a while now…

475
00:24:12,532 --> 00:24:13,867
I see…

476
00:24:14,042 --> 00:24:17,805
But why are you trying to
understand Naruto's feelings, Lee?

477
00:24:18,109 --> 00:24:19,406
For his wedding gift.

478
00:24:19,952 --> 00:24:22,258
In order to find
something he'll like,

479
00:24:22,283 --> 00:24:26,204
I thought I should first
understand his feelings.

480
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,668
I see, so that's it.

481
00:24:29,964 --> 00:24:30,853
In any case,

482
00:24:30,878 --> 00:24:33,214
in order to convey my intense
regard for my friend Naruto,

483
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:34,398
I'm going to put
my entire being into

484
00:24:34,423 --> 00:24:36,925
finding the best
wedding gift for him!

485
00:24:37,389 --> 00:24:38,992
Well then, please excuse me,
Iruka Sensei!

486
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,506
He's exactly like Guy Sensei.

487
00:24:45,531 --> 00:24:47,577
I'm so sorry it was so loud!

488
00:24:47,728 --> 00:24:52,108
Oh no. In fact, I'm happy that
Naruto has a friend like him.

489
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,802
Found ya, Iruka Sensei!

490
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:56,841
You didn't record your message yet!

491
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,213
That's right…
Can you wait a little longer?

492
00:25:00,502 --> 00:25:02,212
Not again…man.

493
00:25:02,717 --> 00:25:04,503
Naruto's wedding gift…

494
00:25:04,887 --> 00:25:06,472
Naruto's wedding gift…

495
00:25:06,722 --> 00:25:08,349
Naruto's wedding gift…

496
00:25:08,653 --> 00:25:10,693
Naruto's…wedding…

497
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,263
Yes!

498
00:25:17,569 --> 00:25:19,237
How about dumbbells?!

499
00:25:21,014 --> 00:25:22,336
Naruto! Hinata!

500
00:25:22,496 --> 00:25:24,415
Congratulations on your marriage!

501
00:25:24,699 --> 00:25:28,094
Please use these dumbbells
and find everlasting happiness…

502
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:29,829
No, no, no, no, no!
Stop!

503
00:25:30,221 --> 00:25:32,190
Dumbbells are definitely useful.

504
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:35,442
Its heaviness is surely symbolic of
the solidity and depth of my friendship…

505
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,761
And more importantly,
they can make you stronger.

506
00:25:37,978 --> 00:25:40,773
Nothing else could
better symbolize our friendship.

507
00:25:41,345 --> 00:25:42,092
But…

508
00:25:42,629 --> 00:25:44,812
It's possible Naruto will get
so hooked on muscle training

509
00:25:44,837 --> 00:25:47,756
that he'll totally ignore Hinata…

510
00:25:49,311 --> 00:25:51,605
Even if Naruto and I
have a special bond,

511
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:55,123
giving him dumbbells
might meet with some resistance.

512
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:58,341
I must think of something else!

513
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:04,666
<i>Ahh! I can't think of anything!</i>

514
00:26:04,691 --> 00:26:05,733
<i>During times like this—!</i>

515
00:26:09,602 --> 00:26:12,809
<i>What gift would make
Naruto and Hinata happy?</i>

516
00:26:13,314 --> 00:26:15,900
<i>I guess it would be something
that reminds them of me.</i>

517
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:19,789
<i>Now if a kunai like this was
specially ordered and made cute…</i>

518
00:26:26,099 --> 00:26:29,061
<i>Marriage, huh?
How nice…!</i>

519
00:26:30,181 --> 00:26:30,873
<i>Hold on a sec!</i>

520
00:26:31,124 --> 00:26:33,893
<i>One is in love with her dream man
and getting married, happily ever after.</i>

521
00:26:33,918 --> 00:26:35,208
<i>While I don't even
have a boyfriend,</i>

522
00:26:35,233 --> 00:26:37,569
<i>and train every day from
morning until night…</i>

523
00:26:37,713 --> 00:26:38,668
<i>This would be…</i>

524
00:26:39,549 --> 00:26:40,883
<i>Kunai again?</i>

525
00:26:40,883 --> 00:26:42,552
<i>But it's Tenten, after all…</i>

526
00:26:43,052 --> 00:26:44,846
<i>When you think of Tenten,
you think kunai…</i>

527
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:47,878
<i>Maybe I should think of
something else…</i>

528
00:26:48,028 --> 00:26:49,742
<i>Get something
that doesn't kill people,</i>

529
00:26:49,767 --> 00:26:51,143
<i>within the set budget</i>

530
00:26:51,335 --> 00:26:53,004
– <i>that captures a maiden's heart…</i>
– Tenten!

531
00:26:54,054 --> 00:26:56,864
– I need to ask you something!
– That voice…

532
00:26:58,885 --> 00:27:00,019
Idiot…idiot.

533
00:27:00,044 --> 00:27:03,089
Calm down when you
ask people something.

534
00:27:03,114 --> 00:27:04,240
I'm sorry.

535
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:06,554
I just couldn't do it by myself.

536
00:27:06,579 --> 00:27:09,832
I had no choice but to ask for
your help and came looking for you…

537
00:27:10,454 --> 00:27:13,374
But…I guess you're in a bind too.

538
00:27:14,044 --> 00:27:14,837
Uh-huh…

539
00:27:15,101 --> 00:27:18,855
Sending the usual gift
won't convey our feelings…

540
00:27:19,047 --> 00:27:23,848
And yet, something that's more
like me may not make them happy…

541
00:27:24,206 --> 00:27:27,435
A wedding gift…
is more complicated than I thought.

542
00:27:29,223 --> 00:27:31,892
What would Neji do?

543
00:27:32,602 --> 00:27:36,022
We must not do that!
We must go and investigate!

544
00:27:36,147 --> 00:27:37,148
Investigate?

545
00:27:37,982 --> 00:27:38,607
Yes!

546
00:27:39,195 --> 00:27:42,637
I get it.
Rather than thinking alone,

547
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:46,666
looking at actual items can give us
more ideas and variations.

548
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,559
There are so many items,

549
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:52,288
I'm sure we'll find something
suitable that fits us,

550
00:27:52,313 --> 00:27:54,816
while also making
Naruto and Hinata happy!

551
00:27:55,124 --> 00:27:57,293
You're right! For example…

552
00:27:57,335 --> 00:27:58,961
How about a sword like this?

553
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:02,131
Umm…

554
00:28:02,248 --> 00:28:04,592
It looks expensive,

555
00:28:04,617 --> 00:28:06,869
but it doesn't have any connection
to a wedding, does it?

556
00:28:07,956 --> 00:28:08,701
No…

557
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,198
They can use it for
their first joint effort.

558
00:28:20,223 --> 00:28:21,892
To cut the cake…that's all?

559
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,319
Not good?

560
00:28:23,344 --> 00:28:27,806
Isn't a cake-cutter pretty low
on the usefulness meter?

561
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,950
Then how about…

562
00:28:30,284 --> 00:28:31,077
…this?

563
00:28:31,213 --> 00:28:32,589
Tonfa?

564
00:28:32,654 --> 00:28:36,450
It's totally you,
since you're a taijutsu specialist…

565
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,469
That has no connection
with a wedding either.

566
00:28:40,869 --> 00:28:41,622
No…

567
00:28:42,963 --> 00:28:45,591
I figured it would be useful
for everyday married life,

568
00:28:45,616 --> 00:28:47,326
since they'll have
more laundry to do…

569
00:28:47,385 --> 00:28:48,844
For hanging laundry?!

570
00:28:49,263 --> 00:28:52,933
Still, I don't think Naruto
will be too pleased with this…

571
00:28:53,224 --> 00:28:56,394
Maybe you should think of
something a bit less strange.

572
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,271
You're lucky, Tenten.

573
00:28:59,397 --> 00:29:00,898
All you have to do…

574
00:29:00,898 --> 00:29:03,359
…is send this thing
that you always use.

575
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:06,404
Huh? Would getting kunai
make them happy?

576
00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:09,115
It's not necessary at all
in married life.

577
00:29:09,407 --> 00:29:11,033
No! You can make full use of it!

578
00:29:14,417 --> 00:29:16,228
It's perfect for newlyweds

579
00:29:16,253 --> 00:29:18,882
who can't decide
what to make for dinner!

580
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,268
Is that any way to use a kunai?!

581
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:23,157
Idiot…idiot.

582
00:29:23,243 --> 00:29:25,837
We didn't find a single thing.

583
00:29:26,317 --> 00:29:28,319
Let's try hard again tomorrow.

584
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:35,641
I can't think of a single thing.

585
00:29:36,684 --> 00:29:38,602
<i>Lee…
Hey, Lee!</i>

586
00:29:42,248 --> 00:29:43,499
Neji!

587
00:29:43,524 --> 00:29:45,019
<i>When you get hooked on one thing,</i>

588
00:29:45,044 --> 00:29:47,069
<i>you even struggle with it
in your dreams…</i>

589
00:29:47,153 --> 00:29:48,779
<i>That's so like you, Lee.</i>

590
00:29:49,182 --> 00:29:51,245
Neji...Is that really you, Neji?

591
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:53,409
<i>You were groaning pretty loud.</i>

592
00:29:54,043 --> 00:29:56,954
I couldn't find a gift for
Naruto and Hinata's wedding.

593
00:29:57,141 --> 00:29:59,644
I spent the entire day looking,

594
00:29:59,832 --> 00:30:02,668
but I've used up
all my ideas and energy…

595
00:30:03,196 --> 00:30:04,670
What about you, Neji?

596
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:08,553
<i>I had one thing I had to tell you…</i>

597
00:30:09,203 --> 00:30:11,038
Neji, I'm…

598
00:30:11,115 --> 00:30:12,032
<i>I know.</i>

599
00:30:12,131 --> 00:30:13,340
<i>Say no more.</i>

600
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,337
<i>Lee, remember this carefully…</i>

601
00:30:16,195 --> 00:30:17,892
<i>Physical strength over endurance!</i>

602
00:30:18,423 --> 00:30:20,066
<i>Physical strength over endurance!</i>

603
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,749
Physical strength over endurance?

604
00:30:23,216 --> 00:30:24,472
<i>And don't forget…Hyuga.</i>

605
00:30:25,048 --> 00:30:26,628
What? H-Hey wait, Neji!

606
00:30:27,353 --> 00:30:29,570
I thought you appeared
because I was

607
00:30:29,612 --> 00:30:31,363
in such a dilemma
about a wedding gift

608
00:30:31,388 --> 00:30:33,139
and you wanted to give me advice!

609
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,192
Oh…

610
00:30:35,785 --> 00:30:36,952
Neji!

611
00:30:36,977 --> 00:30:37,978
Neji?!

612
00:30:40,721 --> 00:30:44,016
Naruto, Hinata,
congratulations on your marriage.

613
00:30:44,016 --> 00:30:46,226
Naruto, who would have expected
a bad little kid

614
00:30:46,226 --> 00:30:47,686
would become such a great man?

615
00:30:48,312 --> 00:30:51,494
Hinata, please take care of Naruto.

616
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,984
I think that's it!

617
00:30:53,984 --> 00:30:55,069
Okay!

618
00:30:55,214 --> 00:30:56,373
It's perfect!

619
00:30:56,499 --> 00:30:59,335
I can just see Big Brother Naruto's
eyes welling up with tears!

620
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:02,139
Okay, I'm off to edit this!
I can't wait!

621
00:31:03,952 --> 00:31:05,454
Oh, Lee!

622
00:31:05,454 --> 00:31:07,748
H-Hello, Iruka Sensei…

623
00:31:08,457 --> 00:31:09,958
What happened to your face?!

624
00:31:10,209 --> 00:31:13,629
I can't decide on a gift
for Naruto's wedding…

625
00:31:14,065 --> 00:31:16,301
On top of that, an old friend
appeared in my dream

626
00:31:16,326 --> 00:31:18,703
and gave me advice that
doesn't make any sense at all and…

627
00:31:18,728 --> 00:31:20,110
…I couldn't sleep
thinking about it.

628
00:31:20,135 --> 00:31:28,238
<i>2765 sheep, 2766 sheep,
2767 Neji, 2768—?</i>

629
00:31:28,907 --> 00:31:30,537
<i>Neji, you jerk!</i>

630
00:31:30,753 --> 00:31:32,504
Oh, that sounds terrible…

631
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:34,865
At this rate,
I'll never be able to convey

632
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,641
the depth of my friendship
to Naruto!

633
00:31:36,941 --> 00:31:39,927
There, there…
Don't take it so seriously.

634
00:31:40,635 --> 00:31:43,566
I'm sure it's a big struggle
for you all…

635
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,415
But I'm very happy.

636
00:31:45,452 --> 00:31:47,454
Happy? Why?

637
00:31:47,893 --> 00:31:50,707
I'm happy to know that
a student I taught

638
00:31:50,732 --> 00:31:54,402
has a friend who will go to
such great lengths.

639
00:31:54,711 --> 00:31:56,519
Although, it may sound like

640
00:31:56,544 --> 00:31:58,546
I'm just trying to
make you feel better…

641
00:31:59,482 --> 00:32:01,067
Oh, no such thing…

642
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:03,535
Actually,
I've never had a chance

643
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,213
to talk like this
to a friend of Naruto's.

644
00:32:07,103 --> 00:32:08,605
Thanks to his upcoming wedding,

645
00:32:08,851 --> 00:32:10,953
I got to talk to you
and the others,

646
00:32:11,051 --> 00:32:16,848
and you've shown me a valuable side
of Naruto I never knew.

647
00:32:17,322 --> 00:32:18,531
I'm grateful for that.

648
00:32:19,262 --> 00:32:21,608
Now that I think about it,
since he graduated,

649
00:32:21,633 --> 00:32:26,108
you guys know much more
about Naruto than I do.

650
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:28,203
Is that so?!

651
00:32:28,412 --> 00:32:28,954
Huh?

652
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:30,700
Why so shocked?

653
00:32:31,081 --> 00:32:32,953
I thought I could ask for your help

654
00:32:32,978 --> 00:32:36,022
with ideas for
Naruto's wedding gift.

655
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,202
Sorry, I'm no help.

656
00:32:40,196 --> 00:32:44,511
But considering the effort
you're putting into finding a gift,

657
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:46,908
I know Naruto will be happy,
whatever you choose.

658
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:48,849
Do you think so?

659
00:32:49,246 --> 00:32:51,686
In fact, if he dares to complain,
as his teacher,

660
00:32:51,711 --> 00:32:53,504
I'll knock some sense into him
all over again!

661
00:32:53,976 --> 00:32:55,559
Did I sound pompous saying that?

662
00:32:55,939 --> 00:32:58,358
As his teacher…knock some sense…
all over again…

663
00:32:58,625 --> 00:32:59,539
That's it!

664
00:32:59,564 --> 00:33:01,274
Huh? What?

665
00:33:02,738 --> 00:33:05,282
I had forgotten
something very valuable!

666
00:33:05,957 --> 00:33:07,814
Iruka Sensei, thank you!

667
00:33:08,536 --> 00:33:09,239
Well then…

668
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,062
What was that?!

669
00:33:15,968 --> 00:33:17,458
So you've come, Lee!

670
00:33:17,794 --> 00:33:19,351
Guy Sensei!

671
00:33:19,752 --> 00:33:22,046
I figured it would be around now.

672
00:33:22,518 --> 00:33:26,790
Judging from your expression,
you're still in a dilemma, eh?

673
00:33:27,048 --> 00:33:28,758
What? How can you tell?

674
00:33:28,972 --> 00:33:31,975
One look at you and I can tell if
you've been training all night

675
00:33:32,059 --> 00:33:34,895
because something's bothering you.

676
00:33:35,071 --> 00:33:36,396
Guy Sensei!

677
00:33:36,438 --> 00:33:41,068
And let me guess…your worries
have to do with the wedding gift.

678
00:33:41,193 --> 00:33:42,034
Huh?!

679
00:33:42,077 --> 00:33:43,796
G-Guy Sensei!

680
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:45,629
Can you read my heart?!

681
00:33:45,864 --> 00:33:50,077
How long have we been together
in the springtime of our youth?

682
00:33:50,118 --> 00:33:51,453
Guy Sensei!

683
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:54,431
I can't even decide what to give
Naruto for his wedding gift…

684
00:33:54,456 --> 00:33:56,583
I'm still only half a shinobi!

685
00:33:56,749 --> 00:33:58,901
Please knock some sense into me!

686
00:33:59,253 --> 00:34:00,879
Well said, Lee!

687
00:34:01,268 --> 00:34:04,313
Let's search together
for a wedding gift!

688
00:34:04,357 --> 00:34:06,477
– Guy Sensei!
– Lee!

689
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,463
– Guy Sensei!
– Lee!

690
00:34:08,488 --> 00:34:10,490
– Lee!
– Guy Sensei!

691
00:34:10,864 --> 00:34:13,347
Let's set up some rules before
choosing a wedding gift.

692
00:34:13,475 --> 00:34:16,019
First, it can't be
something common.

693
00:34:16,019 --> 00:34:18,689
But it mustn't be
too unconventional.

694
00:34:19,106 --> 00:34:21,775
Yes, we figured out that much.

695
00:34:21,979 --> 00:34:24,528
It's from that point
that we got stuck.

696
00:34:24,553 --> 00:34:27,860
And…the wedding gift should be one
that leaves a lasting impression,

697
00:34:28,006 --> 00:34:31,133
and conveys friendship, effort,
and triumph in choosing it.

698
00:34:31,368 --> 00:34:33,203
So what would be a gift
that personifies me…

699
00:34:33,287 --> 00:34:35,372
and the hot springtime of youth—

700
00:34:35,397 --> 00:34:36,815
…what would that be?

701
00:34:37,582 --> 00:34:39,835
If it does exist, it would…

702
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:44,172
definitely include wearing
a fashionable bodysuit!

703
00:34:44,197 --> 00:34:45,941
Huh?! Why a bodysuit?

704
00:34:45,966 --> 00:34:49,428
Yes! The hot spring of youth
means sweat and tears!

705
00:34:49,553 --> 00:34:51,847
Can sweat and tears
be given as gifts?!

706
00:34:52,029 --> 00:34:54,224
– No, of course not!
– Just a minute, Lee!

707
00:34:54,349 --> 00:34:57,394
In the first place,
can man live on will power alone?!

708
00:34:57,477 --> 00:35:00,689
Can he overcome the dangers of
divorce with only patience?!

709
00:35:00,772 --> 00:35:03,275
W-Wait, Sensei…
You're going off the subject…

710
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,718
I've been thinking the same thing!

711
00:35:04,818 --> 00:35:06,570
Should curry be medium-hot?
Or super-spicy?!

712
00:35:06,595 --> 00:35:08,723
Aw man! We're on totally
different wave lengths!

713
00:35:08,822 --> 00:35:11,771
All right! I'm going to do a handstand
and walk around the village 5,000 times!

714
00:35:11,796 --> 00:35:13,535
Then I'll go 5,200 times!

715
00:35:13,535 --> 00:35:15,329
Fine, then I'll go 5,300 times!

716
00:35:15,329 --> 00:35:17,280
– 5,400 times!
– 5,500 times!

717
00:35:17,305 --> 00:35:18,411
Stop it!

718
00:35:20,765 --> 00:35:23,503
It's true.
We've gone way off the subject.

719
00:35:23,528 --> 00:35:25,113
So, let's just go back
to the beginning.

720
00:35:25,138 --> 00:35:26,854
And go over the basics once more.

721
00:35:27,507 --> 00:35:28,802
Basics?

722
00:35:28,884 --> 00:35:29,885
Yes.

723
00:35:30,177 --> 00:35:32,554
First of all,
what is a wedding ceremony?

724
00:35:33,114 --> 00:35:36,379
Th-That's a very
philosophical question…

725
00:35:36,433 --> 00:35:38,259
Uh, is that really
where we're starting?

726
00:35:38,842 --> 00:35:39,843
Then let me ask you this?

727
00:35:40,001 --> 00:35:43,004
What is absolutely necessary
for a wedding ceremony?

728
00:35:43,315 --> 00:35:45,609
Wouldn't that be…love?

729
00:35:45,965 --> 00:35:47,008
You are a poet.

730
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:48,211
However, Lee…

731
00:35:48,236 --> 00:35:51,406
I think it's the bride and groom!

732
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,408
Oh! Y-Yes, there's no wedding
without a bride and groom!

733
00:35:53,408 --> 00:35:54,076
Right?

734
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:56,787
A wedding ceremony
without a bride and groom

735
00:35:56,955 --> 00:35:59,041
is not a wedding ceremony!

736
00:35:59,164 --> 00:36:01,375
It's just a ceremony!

737
00:36:01,516 --> 00:36:04,713
And by ceremony,
who knows what kind of ceremony!

738
00:36:04,808 --> 00:36:06,017
How blind I am!

739
00:36:06,254 --> 00:36:08,482
Guy Sensei,
you have the ability to see

740
00:36:08,507 --> 00:36:10,842
what something is
beneath the surface!

741
00:36:11,093 --> 00:36:12,094
You are amazing!

742
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:13,528
You don't need to go overboard…

743
00:36:13,553 --> 00:36:17,099
You have always been my role model…

744
00:36:17,224 --> 00:36:18,975
– My everlasting hero!
– No one's paying any attention.

745
00:36:19,017 --> 00:36:22,646
So now, we can think about
what kind of gift

746
00:36:22,671 --> 00:36:25,680
would please
a bride and groom, right?

747
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:26,903
Exactly!

748
00:36:26,928 --> 00:36:28,816
I'm starting to get a bad feeling
about this…

749
00:36:28,985 --> 00:36:30,654
All right!
I'll be the groom.

750
00:36:30,816 --> 00:36:32,447
Lee, you are the bride!

751
00:36:32,447 --> 00:36:33,590
Yes, Guy Sensei!

752
00:36:33,615 --> 00:36:34,908
I knew it…

753
00:36:35,575 --> 00:36:37,369
Why do I have to play the baby?

754
00:36:37,452 --> 00:36:39,621
Not this again?

755
00:36:39,621 --> 00:36:40,539
Hi…

756
00:36:40,701 --> 00:36:42,152
I'm home.

757
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:49,214
What time do you think it is?!

758
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:50,641
It's the new spring fashions!

759
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,168
– Move!
– How cute!

760
00:36:52,342 --> 00:36:53,593
– That's mine!
– She took it!

761
00:36:53,677 --> 00:36:54,761
Give it back!

762
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:57,139
How dare you!

763
00:36:57,222 --> 00:36:59,558
<i>Seventh Gate of Shock! Open!</i>

764
00:37:05,147 --> 00:37:06,398
– Damn it, – Well, Lee?

765
00:37:06,423 --> 00:37:08,217
– what are you making me do?
– Is something forming in your mind?

766
00:37:08,242 --> 00:37:11,079
I think I'm almost there…

767
00:37:11,401 --> 00:37:13,549
But after that, it's still far off…

768
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:14,629
Well, never mind.

769
00:37:15,157 --> 00:37:18,452
You won't get an answer
if you think too deeply.

770
00:37:18,607 --> 00:37:21,485
If Neji were here,
he wouldn't even speak to you.

771
00:37:21,965 --> 00:37:24,729
No, but Neji would,
if it's for Hinata's sake.

772
00:37:25,495 --> 00:37:27,930
The husband's female coworker
appears out of nowhere

773
00:37:27,955 --> 00:37:30,207
to threaten
their peaceful family life.

774
00:37:30,257 --> 00:37:32,343
Neji would show up
to take on that perfect role!

775
00:37:32,424 --> 00:37:33,508
He would not!

776
00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:35,844
Besides, how can you misinterpret
Neji like that?!

777
00:37:35,927 --> 00:37:36,428
Neji…

778
00:37:36,562 --> 00:37:39,306
Even if as a ghost,
Neji would appear.

779
00:37:39,386 --> 00:37:40,849
Neji would appear?

780
00:37:42,058 --> 00:37:43,935
<i>Physical strength over endurance!</i>

781
00:37:44,144 --> 00:37:46,062
<i>Physical strength over endurance!</i>

782
00:37:47,606 --> 00:37:48,815
I see!

783
00:37:49,149 --> 00:37:50,241
I get it.

784
00:37:51,459 --> 00:37:53,503
So that's it, Neji.

785
00:37:53,528 --> 00:37:57,657
So that was meant for Hinata,
not me.

786
00:37:57,782 --> 00:37:59,034
What do you mean?

787
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:02,170
Physical strength is essential
to protect a family!

788
00:38:02,617 --> 00:38:05,063
– The highest form of strength!
– Absolutely!

789
00:38:05,426 --> 00:38:08,409
Cooking, washing, cleaning,
raising the kids, shopping…

790
00:38:08,434 --> 00:38:11,980
The newlywed life is
a nonstop test of muscles!

791
00:38:12,005 --> 00:38:13,173
Yes!

792
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:16,733
The newlyweds
must prepare for that!

793
00:38:18,303 --> 00:38:21,848
If that is so,
there is only one answer!

794
00:38:21,873 --> 00:38:24,459
The truest gift from us should be…

795
00:38:24,518 --> 00:38:25,602
– Dumbbells!
– Dumbbells!

796
00:38:25,602 --> 00:38:27,312
You've got to be kidding!

797
00:38:27,354 --> 00:38:29,397
– Guy Sensei…
– Lee…

798
00:38:30,565 --> 00:38:32,442
– Guy Sensei!
– Lee!

799
00:38:32,653 --> 00:38:33,502
Hah!

800
00:38:33,669 --> 00:38:36,238
Lee! You shall present
the left dumbbell!

801
00:38:36,325 --> 00:38:36,905
Right!

802
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:38,448
And I'll present the right!

803
00:38:38,573 --> 00:38:40,033
Let's go, Guy Sensei!

804
00:38:40,116 --> 00:38:42,369
Yes!
Our wedding gift…

805
00:38:42,394 --> 00:38:44,146
will lose to no one!

806
00:38:47,028 --> 00:38:50,309
Okay, yeah...I'm gonna go with
a custom-made kunai.

807
00:38:54,849 --> 00:38:56,419
What, you fool!

808
00:38:57,373 --> 00:38:58,321
Delivery?

809
00:38:58,524 --> 00:38:59,585
– I see…
– It's gonna take some time.

810
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:01,738
– You've decided on a wedding gift?
– Is that okay?

811
00:39:01,763 --> 00:39:03,473
– Yes, and it's all thanks to
– Okay, sorry.

812
00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:06,011
– Guy Sensei and you, Iruka Sensei.
– Ayame is out right now.

813
00:39:06,326 --> 00:39:08,653
– It pays to have great mentors!
– Is that okay? Thank you.

814
00:39:08,995 --> 00:39:11,039
– Well, if that's what you believe,
– Thank you.

815
00:39:11,064 --> 00:39:12,691
– it makes me very happy.
– What's your order?

816
00:39:12,858 --> 00:39:14,442
What are you saying?

817
00:39:14,526 --> 00:39:16,486
Naruto is blessed to have a mentor
like you, Iruka Sensei.

818
00:39:16,528 --> 00:39:18,113
I'm sure he feels the same way!

819
00:39:18,196 --> 00:39:19,406
Oh, thank you.

820
00:39:19,447 --> 00:39:22,867
Okay, I'm going to take a look
at some dumbbells.

821
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:23,864
So if you'll excuse me!

822
00:39:27,774 --> 00:39:29,086
<i>Naruto's mentor, huh…?</i>

823
00:39:29,651 --> 00:39:31,518
<i>I should find out more about
how Naruto's grown</i>

824
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:32,941
<i>after leaving my care,</i>

825
00:39:33,295 --> 00:39:38,466
<i>and what kind of bonds
he's made with friends.</i>

826
00:39:38,608 --> 00:39:40,777
<i>If I'm truly Naruto's mentor…</i>

827
00:39:40,974 --> 00:39:42,404
Oh! Iruka Sensei!

828
00:39:42,429 --> 00:39:43,542
We meet again!

829
00:39:43,623 --> 00:39:46,167
Konohamaru, just in time.

830
00:39:46,308 --> 00:39:50,228
That message I recorded last time…
Can I do it over?

831
00:39:50,412 --> 00:39:52,373
Sure. But why?

832
00:39:52,782 --> 00:39:55,584
I want to find out
more about Naruto,

833
00:39:55,609 --> 00:39:57,027
and send him a proper message…

834
00:39:57,827 --> 00:39:59,871
A message from his mentor…

835
00:40:00,641 --> 00:40:01,669
I'm back!

836
00:40:02,198 --> 00:40:03,241
Sorry to keep you waiting.

837
00:40:03,366 --> 00:40:04,409
What will you have?

838
00:40:04,612 --> 00:40:06,698
Um…

839
00:40:13,858 --> 00:40:16,444
I'll have the miso char siu.
Make it a large.

840
00:40:18,298 --> 00:40:19,299
Coming right up.

841
00:40:19,507 --> 00:40:21,384
One large miso char siu ramen!

842
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,319
All right!

843
00:40:22,344 --> 00:40:24,387
A large miso char siu ramen!

844
00:40:24,429 --> 00:40:25,305
Miso?!

845
00:40:29,809 --> 00:40:32,020
Hey Ino…you here?

846
00:40:32,896 --> 00:40:35,273
Yeah? What are you two
doing together?

847
00:40:35,607 --> 00:40:38,985
Remember what Kakashi Sensei
said last time?

848
00:40:39,248 --> 00:40:41,463
<i>I am giving you a secret mission</i>

849
00:40:41,488 --> 00:40:43,907
<i>in which you shall each prepare
a congratulatory gift for</i>

850
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,617
<i>Naruto and Hinata's wedding.</i>

851
00:40:46,201 --> 00:40:47,410
Of course!

852
00:40:47,668 --> 00:40:49,137
And? What about it?

853
00:40:49,162 --> 00:40:51,998
Oh...I thought we'd discuss
what to get them.

854
00:40:52,207 --> 00:40:53,249
Oh, sorry!

855
00:40:53,249 --> 00:40:56,252
I've got something great
picked out already

856
00:40:56,378 --> 00:40:58,450
and I'm about to go
to the store.

857
00:40:58,644 --> 00:41:00,354
Which store?
We'll go with you!

858
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:01,385
No, you aren't!

859
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:03,175
We can't get gifts from
the same store.

860
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,035
You two can think of
something on your own!

861
00:41:06,028 --> 00:41:07,363
Later!

862
00:41:10,617 --> 00:41:12,369
What are we gonna do?

863
00:41:12,394 --> 00:41:13,269
Excuse me, Miss!

864
00:41:13,353 --> 00:41:15,146
I'd like to get some ice cream
for dessert.

865
00:41:15,289 --> 00:41:16,331
What about you, Shikamaru?

866
00:41:16,356 --> 00:41:17,524
None for me.

867
00:41:17,903 --> 00:41:19,901
You sure can eat, though…

868
00:41:20,168 --> 00:41:22,712
Your appetite hasn't changed
since you were a kid.

869
00:41:22,737 --> 00:41:25,175
But these days,
I've started liking thigh meat,

870
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,925
as well as meat that's really rare,

871
00:41:27,071 --> 00:41:29,067
so I think I'm going towards
more grown-up tastes.

872
00:41:29,225 --> 00:41:30,643
So it's your taste buds?

873
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:33,495
Anyway, getting back
to the subject.

874
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,504
Maybe yuzu sorbet would've
been better than ice cream…

875
00:41:37,529 --> 00:41:40,937
No! I'm talking about the wedding gift
for Naruto and Hinata!

876
00:41:40,975 --> 00:41:42,810
Oh that.

877
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:44,592
Here's your ice cream.

878
00:41:44,592 --> 00:41:45,802
Oh, it's here!

879
00:41:46,336 --> 00:41:50,156
Judging from Ino's attitude,
she'll be no help…

880
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:51,491
If this keeps going,

881
00:41:51,516 --> 00:41:54,602
we might be the only ones
who can't find a present.

882
00:41:55,562 --> 00:41:57,781
What do you mean by "we"?

883
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:00,773
I've already picked
something out.

884
00:42:02,778 --> 00:42:04,864
R-Really?!
What are you getting?

885
00:42:05,605 --> 00:42:08,295
I'm thinking about
giving them this.

886
00:42:11,126 --> 00:42:12,704
Hey, this is a—!

887
00:42:12,704 --> 00:42:14,581
Yup, a gift certificate
for a dinner!

888
00:42:14,622 --> 00:42:17,041
And it's not just for
an average diner!

889
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:20,145
It's a gift certificate for
a super-fancy teahouse

890
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,422
that VIPs like the Hokage go to!

891
00:42:22,693 --> 00:42:24,153
Well, it is a special occasion…

892
00:42:25,165 --> 00:42:26,217
<i>What's going on?!</i>

893
00:42:26,301 --> 00:42:28,074
<i>This is Choji…</i>

894
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:30,347
<i>And he chose the perfect gift!</i>

895
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,607
<i>Having dinner in a restaurant
you wouldn't normally be able to go to</i>

896
00:42:33,835 --> 00:42:37,200
<i>is special and really memorable
for a couple!</i>

897
00:42:37,562 --> 00:42:40,398
<i>Not a lot of gifts would have
as much impact!</i>

898
00:42:40,582 --> 00:42:43,042
<i>And even if this was
for a special occasion…</i>

899
00:42:43,067 --> 00:42:45,320
<i>Choji's willing to part
with a gift certificate</i>

900
00:42:45,345 --> 00:42:46,930
<i>to a super-fancy restaurant,
just like that?</i>

901
00:42:47,085 --> 00:42:49,671
Miss, may I have another bowl
of ice cream?

902
00:42:50,278 --> 00:42:52,343
<i>Are you really
the Choji I know?!</i>

903
00:42:52,368 --> 00:42:54,525
<i>It's not just your taste buds
that grew up.</i>

904
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:56,798
<i>Have you completely
become an adult?</i>

905
00:42:58,291 --> 00:42:59,292
What?

906
00:43:00,149 --> 00:43:01,233
Here's your ice cream.

907
00:43:01,965 --> 00:43:04,968
It just happened to be
a three-for-one special.

908
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:09,651
<i>Why is it three to a group?</i>

909
00:43:09,946 --> 00:43:12,071
<i>Usually a romantic dinner
is for two.</i>

910
00:43:12,096 --> 00:43:14,682
<i>You'd think a fancy restaurant
would be aware of that!</i>

911
00:43:14,875 --> 00:43:17,452
<i>Choji will tag along
if it's three to a group!</i>

912
00:43:17,477 --> 00:43:19,896
Shikamaru?
What's wrong, Shikamaru?

913
00:43:20,121 --> 00:43:21,164
It's nothing…

914
00:43:21,189 --> 00:43:23,233
Are you planning to go too?

915
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:24,651
Are you joking?

916
00:43:24,676 --> 00:43:28,347
Even I know better than to tag along
with some newlyweds…

917
00:43:28,406 --> 00:43:30,997
R-Right? Of course you would.

918
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:34,702
I was gonna ask the waitress to
seat me at a different table.

919
00:43:35,662 --> 00:43:36,663
<i>So, you ARE going?!</i>

920
00:43:36,886 --> 00:43:39,724
<i>Still, this is not the time
to get on Choji's case.</i>

921
00:43:39,875 --> 00:43:43,503
<i>I still haven't decided to
what to get them.</i>

922
00:43:43,711 --> 00:43:45,213
<i>And I can't waste a minute
on deciding.</i>

923
00:43:45,313 --> 00:43:48,024
<i>I'm thinking…
something useful.</i>

924
00:43:48,049 --> 00:43:50,505
<i>A decorative item would just get
in the way if it's not to their taste.</i>

925
00:43:50,765 --> 00:43:52,579
<i>Flowers or food would
be gone eventually,</i>

926
00:43:52,604 --> 00:43:54,981
<i>and it would seem like
a seasonal gift.</i>

927
00:43:55,637 --> 00:43:58,265
<i>Sending them something
is really risky…</i>

928
00:43:58,499 --> 00:44:00,834
<i>So that leaves…cash!</i>

929
00:44:01,734 --> 00:44:02,818
<i>That's not a bad idea.</i>

930
00:44:02,843 --> 00:44:05,083
<i>They can get whatever they want,</i>

931
00:44:05,243 --> 00:44:07,412
<i>and it's way better than getting
something they won't use</i>

932
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:09,452
<i>or something that's identical
to someone else's gift.</i>

933
00:44:10,495 --> 00:44:12,313
<i>But wait a minute…</i>

934
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:14,117
<i>What if I'm the only one
giving them cash?</i>

935
00:44:14,175 --> 00:44:15,885
It's not a lot, but please accept it!

936
00:44:16,084 --> 00:44:16,845
<i>Not good!</i>

937
00:44:17,048 --> 00:44:19,097
<i>Everyone will think I was
the only one too lazy</i>

938
00:44:19,122 --> 00:44:21,015
<i>to go out and buy a gift and</i>

939
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,209
<i>just gave them cash
without thinking.</i>

940
00:44:23,609 --> 00:44:25,228
Shikamaru, you okay?

941
00:44:25,253 --> 00:44:27,644
U-Uh, yeah...I just felt a chill.

942
00:44:28,064 --> 00:44:31,913
Sorry, did you get cold from
watching me eat all that ice cream?

943
00:44:32,121 --> 00:44:33,312
That's not it…

944
00:44:33,678 --> 00:44:36,581
I got hot from eating all that
barbecue, so it was just what I needed.

945
00:44:36,739 --> 00:44:39,833
Besides, I'm the kinda guy
who can eat ice cream

946
00:44:40,086 --> 00:44:43,058
even if I'm traveling
in snow country!

947
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:45,607
My appetite beats
the cold every time.

948
00:44:46,441 --> 00:44:49,639
Damn it, no one can
beat your appetite—

949
00:44:50,486 --> 00:44:52,363
Choji! What did you just say?!

950
00:44:52,687 --> 00:44:54,730
My appetite beats the cold?

951
00:44:54,821 --> 00:44:56,364
No, before that!

952
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:57,925
What about snow country?

953
00:44:57,950 --> 00:44:58,761
Oh…

954
00:44:58,885 --> 00:45:01,722
I can eat ice cream even if
I'm traveling in snow country…

955
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:03,747
That's it!

956
00:45:04,044 --> 00:45:05,629
A honeymoon?

957
00:45:05,949 --> 00:45:10,066
Yeah...I'm gonna gift Naruto
and Hinata a honeymoon.

958
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:12,632
So where are you off to now?

959
00:45:13,059 --> 00:45:16,771
I have to decide on a place,
and go check it out.

960
00:45:17,277 --> 00:45:19,274
And I need to get
a woman's point of view

961
00:45:19,457 --> 00:45:22,047
so I can get a sense of
what Hinata might like.

962
00:45:22,685 --> 00:45:24,387
If only Ino were here…

963
00:45:25,047 --> 00:45:25,870
There she is!

964
00:45:33,582 --> 00:45:34,513
H-Hey…

965
00:45:34,747 --> 00:45:37,750
It's been awhile…
ever since that day, huh?

966
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:39,308
Y-Yeah.

967
00:45:39,448 --> 00:45:41,476
What are you guys up to?

968
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:45,800
Uh, stuff…We just had
some lunch. And you?

969
00:45:46,748 --> 00:45:49,751
I'm here to discuss
the Chunin Exams

970
00:45:49,776 --> 00:45:51,820
and making my rounds
to people…

971
00:45:51,845 --> 00:45:53,680
O-Oh…that so?

972
00:45:54,057 --> 00:45:55,766
What the hell?!

973
00:45:56,027 --> 00:45:57,654
I thought you meant
Ino was there…

974
00:45:57,832 --> 00:46:00,674
You said
a "woman's point of view,"

975
00:46:00,825 --> 00:46:03,161
so it doesn't have to be Ino.

976
00:46:03,306 --> 00:46:06,362
But she's a warrior-type
to the core.

977
00:46:06,387 --> 00:46:08,556
I can't talk to her about
a wedding gift…

978
00:46:09,021 --> 00:46:09,855
<i>What?</i>

979
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,216
<i>A honeymoon as a wedding gift?</i>

980
00:46:12,368 --> 00:46:14,995
<i>Talk about a silly
and pathetic idea.</i>

981
00:46:15,498 --> 00:46:18,209
I just know she'd say
something like that.

982
00:46:18,533 --> 00:46:21,323
Wouldn't that apply
to Ino as well?

983
00:46:21,427 --> 00:46:24,263
Hey, what're you two
whispering about?

984
00:46:24,421 --> 00:46:26,382
Oh, it's nothing…

985
00:46:26,499 --> 00:46:29,844
I think Shikamaru wants to talk
to you about something.

986
00:46:29,962 --> 00:46:31,412
T-Talk to me?

987
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:37,297
<i>Maybe…next time…
we can go get a bite to eat.</i>

988
00:46:37,844 --> 00:46:40,304
T-Talk about what?

989
00:46:40,644 --> 00:46:42,159
Damn it, Choji!

990
00:46:44,472 --> 00:46:46,519
<i>I can't come out and
say something like,</i>

991
00:46:46,544 --> 00:46:49,422
<i>"It's no use talking to Temari
about honeymoons."</i>

992
00:46:50,356 --> 00:46:51,274
Well…

993
00:46:51,303 --> 00:46:52,554
I guess have no choice…

994
00:46:53,368 --> 00:46:54,869
Well, you see…

995
00:46:55,243 --> 00:46:58,398
I'm seriously thinking about
a honeymoon.

996
00:46:58,638 --> 00:47:00,800
So, if it were you,
where would you like to go?

997
00:47:00,825 --> 00:47:01,576
Huh?!

998
00:47:01,681 --> 00:47:03,487
A-A honeymoon?!

999
00:47:03,512 --> 00:47:04,517
W-What's the matter?

1000
00:47:04,612 --> 00:47:05,613
N-Nothing.

1001
00:47:05,705 --> 00:47:07,540
A honeymoon, huh?

1002
00:47:07,857 --> 00:47:11,444
W-Why would you ask me that?

1003
00:47:11,669 --> 00:47:13,588
Huh? Well, I just figured…

1004
00:47:15,231 --> 00:47:16,209
<i>Wait a second.</i>

1005
00:47:16,421 --> 00:47:19,424
<i>I can't come out and say
it really doesn't matter who,</i>

1006
00:47:19,555 --> 00:47:21,140
<i>I just need
a woman's opinion, can I?</i>

1007
00:47:21,368 --> 00:47:25,164
I figured you'd be
the best one to ask.

1008
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:27,732
I-I'm the best one?

1009
00:47:28,087 --> 00:47:29,088
I-I see.

1010
00:47:29,411 --> 00:47:32,539
O-Okay then, I'll hear you out.

1011
00:47:33,126 --> 00:47:34,418
O-Oh…

1012
00:47:34,681 --> 00:47:40,311
Well, I thought a hot spring
would be nice and relaxing…

1013
00:47:40,698 --> 00:47:42,825
Does that sound like something
an old man would like?

1014
00:47:43,459 --> 00:47:45,878
No, a hot spring sounds great!

1015
00:47:46,081 --> 00:47:47,976
Really? Awesome!

1016
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:51,454
Good food and hot springs…
perfect, right?

1017
00:47:52,031 --> 00:47:55,268
<i>Good. At least I got confirmation.
So now…</i>

1018
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:57,775
Now you have to
choose where, right?

1019
00:47:57,925 --> 00:47:59,812
Huh? Oh, yeah.

1020
00:48:00,135 --> 00:48:01,929
Maybe we can check some out.

1021
00:48:02,059 --> 00:48:05,062
It's still early.
Why not go now?

1022
00:48:05,139 --> 00:48:07,009
Yeah, that's true. Then…

1023
00:48:07,242 --> 00:48:09,334
I'm going to Amaguriama.

1024
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:10,547
So why don't you two go?

1025
00:48:10,733 --> 00:48:11,345
Huh?!

1026
00:48:12,563 --> 00:48:16,275
Sorry, I just have to have
some dessert after eating!

1027
00:48:16,459 --> 00:48:17,877
You just ate!

1028
00:48:18,015 --> 00:48:19,892
I always save room for dessert.

1029
00:48:20,001 --> 00:48:22,921
You just filled that room earlier!

1030
00:48:24,316 --> 00:48:25,159
<i>You idiot!</i>

1031
00:48:25,159 --> 00:48:26,702
<i>Because of Choji's big mouth,</i>

1032
00:48:26,925 --> 00:48:30,262
<i>Temari's standing there
red-faced and upset!</i>

1033
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:34,775
Sorry, Choji didn't mean to
get you upset or anything.

1034
00:48:35,118 --> 00:48:37,079
Since we're talking
about honeymoons,

1035
00:48:37,104 --> 00:48:38,731
he figured there's no sense
I go alone.

1036
00:48:38,976 --> 00:48:40,596
Yeah, that's right.

1037
00:48:40,621 --> 00:48:43,207
A honeymoon is meant for two,
so you guys should go.

1038
00:48:45,553 --> 00:48:48,514
Okay, you two. I'm off.

1039
00:48:48,978 --> 00:48:50,696
Hey, uh…Mr. C-Choji?!

1040
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:54,897
<i>What am I supposed to do now?</i>

1041
00:49:00,485 --> 00:49:01,279
I'll go with you.

1042
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:03,009
Huh?

1043
00:49:09,795 --> 00:49:11,463
<i>How did it turn out like this?</i>

1044
00:49:11,488 --> 00:49:13,782
<i>W-What's with this strange
nervousness?</i>

1045
00:49:14,019 --> 00:49:16,354
<i>Anyway, I never expected
Temari to help me out</i>

1046
00:49:16,379 --> 00:49:18,673
<i>with choosing a wedding gift
for Naruto and Hinata.</i>

1047
00:49:18,854 --> 00:49:19,647
<i>However…</i>

1048
00:49:19,798 --> 00:49:21,758
<i>Why is she so silent
all of a sudden?</i>

1049
00:49:21,935 --> 00:49:23,205
<i>I can't get a read
on her at all!</i>

1050
00:49:23,666 --> 00:49:26,001
<i>First, I have to get her
out of her bad mood.</i>

1051
00:49:26,483 --> 00:49:28,897
W-Well...Since we're out…

1052
00:49:29,048 --> 00:49:30,383
should we stop by
a couple places?

1053
00:49:30,408 --> 00:49:32,202
O-Oh, sure…

1054
00:49:43,539 --> 00:49:46,250
That's rare of you to miss.

1055
00:49:50,784 --> 00:49:51,538
What?!

1056
00:49:56,913 --> 00:49:58,039
Sorry…

1057
00:49:58,250 --> 00:49:59,709
This was all I could win.

1058
00:50:01,286 --> 00:50:02,569
<i>I'm not completely sure,</i>

1059
00:50:02,594 --> 00:50:04,221
<i>but I think she's in
a good mood now.</i>

1060
00:50:19,552 --> 00:50:21,471
<i>Thank goodness!
It's still here!</i>

1061
00:50:22,087 --> 00:50:24,514
<i>I knew it was
the perfect wedding gift.</i>

1062
00:50:25,218 --> 00:50:27,408
<i>It's cute and simple.</i>

1063
00:50:27,714 --> 00:50:29,174
<i>It's one of a kind!</i>

1064
00:50:29,546 --> 00:50:32,007
<i>I had to get money
from my savings,</i>

1065
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,162
<i>but I know Hinata will love it!</i>

1066
00:50:35,187 --> 00:50:38,330
<i>Anyway, my wedding gift
to them is set!</i>

1067
00:50:39,938 --> 00:50:40,923
I-Ino…

1068
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:42,438
Imagine seeing you here.

1069
00:50:42,463 --> 00:50:45,049
I can say the same about you.

1070
00:50:45,636 --> 00:50:47,260
– <i>No way!</i>
– <i>She isn't—!</i>

1071
00:50:47,581 --> 00:50:50,596
B-By the way, have you seen
Naruto lately?

1072
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,265
No, not at all.

1073
00:50:52,515 --> 00:50:54,558
Imagine that,
Naruto getting married.

1074
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:56,769
He used to be crazy
about you long ago.

1075
00:50:56,794 --> 00:50:59,170
That was back when we were kids.

1076
00:50:59,447 --> 00:51:01,984
I'm really happy
he and Hinata are together.

1077
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:03,620
<i>There's no mistake…</i>

1078
00:51:03,786 --> 00:51:04,633
<i>She's also…</i>

1079
00:51:05,135 --> 00:51:07,596
– <i>planning on that for a wedding gift!</i>
– <i>planning on that for a wedding gift!</i>

1080
00:51:07,949 --> 00:51:11,070
<i>I have to get this picture frame
before her!</i>

1081
00:51:11,371 --> 00:51:12,433
<i>But how…?</i>

1082
00:51:13,939 --> 00:51:21,197
Hey Sakura, were you planning on
getting this for Naruto and Hinata?

1083
00:51:21,642 --> 00:51:22,169
Huh?

1084
00:51:22,295 --> 00:51:26,632
<i>That's right! I have to provoke her
and make her too proud to buy it.</i>

1085
00:51:27,086 --> 00:51:29,576
That's impossible, right?

1086
00:51:29,601 --> 00:51:32,438
You wouldn't get something
that tacky, would you?

1087
00:51:33,451 --> 00:51:35,327
<i>I'm not gonna fall for it.</i>

1088
00:51:35,352 --> 00:51:39,689
<i>This woman's trying to diss that
picture frame, so I won't buy it.</i>

1089
00:51:40,402 --> 00:51:41,737
What are you talking about?

1090
00:51:41,789 --> 00:51:44,709
You were totally about
to buy it earlier…

1091
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:46,068
Th-That's…

1092
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:50,945
Why would you even think about
buying something tacky? How stupid!

1093
00:51:51,132 --> 00:51:51,821
Stupid?!

1094
00:51:52,303 --> 00:51:54,677
I didn't say
I was going to buy it!

1095
00:51:54,702 --> 00:51:59,457
I was just gonna move it out
of the way because it's trash.

1096
00:52:02,184 --> 00:52:05,688
Really, you may have brute
strength, but you have no taste at all!

1097
00:52:05,713 --> 00:52:07,480
Brute strength?!

1098
00:52:07,686 --> 00:52:10,323
Talk about a lame comparison!

1099
00:52:10,348 --> 00:52:11,599
Excuse me!

1100
00:52:11,953 --> 00:52:13,946
You're annoying
the other customers.

1101
00:52:13,971 --> 00:52:15,065
See, Ino!

1102
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,731
You're annoying the others!

1103
00:52:16,756 --> 00:52:18,698
You're the one who's yelling!

1104
00:52:18,723 --> 00:52:20,330
You started it!

1105
00:52:21,087 --> 00:52:22,613
This is mine!

1106
00:52:22,638 --> 00:52:23,472
Hey, that's mine!

1107
00:52:23,556 --> 00:52:25,182
I found it first!

1108
00:52:25,266 --> 00:52:26,684
Now, now…

1109
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:29,937
Please don't pull so hard,
or else—!

1110
00:52:30,759 --> 00:52:32,148
– Shut up!
– Shut up!

1111
00:52:34,917 --> 00:52:36,669
You've got some nerve!

1112
00:52:39,851 --> 00:52:42,045
Because of you,
we got kicked out!

1113
00:52:42,078 --> 00:52:43,864
That's my line!

1114
00:52:44,135 --> 00:52:47,263
You have no sense
of mutual compromise!

1115
00:52:47,388 --> 00:52:50,417
You have no regard for anyone, you have
no chest, all you have is brute strength!

1116
00:52:50,976 --> 00:52:51,548
Huh?!

1117
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:54,241
My chest has nothing
to do with this!

1118
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,423
There is nothing you
can beat me in,

1119
00:52:56,501 --> 00:52:59,504
so you always try to bring up
something unrelated! You should stop that.

1120
00:53:00,174 --> 00:53:02,260
I don't know the meaning
of not winning.

1121
00:53:02,285 --> 00:53:05,214
And I win hands down
in femininity.

1122
00:53:05,239 --> 00:53:06,449
Feminine?!

1123
00:53:06,532 --> 00:53:07,533
You? How?

1124
00:53:07,783 --> 00:53:09,177
Now, now…

1125
00:53:09,202 --> 00:53:11,078
Stop your fighting, you two.

1126
00:53:11,103 --> 00:53:13,188
Choji! Perfect timing!

1127
00:53:13,453 --> 00:53:16,594
Who's more feminine?
Me or Sakura?!

1128
00:53:16,658 --> 00:53:19,185
You can't just ask something
like that out of the blue…

1129
00:53:20,202 --> 00:53:23,706
Even your own teammate, Choji,
won't pick you. How sad!

1130
00:53:23,799 --> 00:53:24,508
Huh?!

1131
00:53:24,857 --> 00:53:28,930
Choji's not on your team, but he won't
even try to flatter you. That is so sad!

1132
00:53:29,047 --> 00:53:30,840
H-Hey, cut it out.

1133
00:53:31,143 --> 00:53:32,728
Hmm...Okay then…

1134
00:53:32,837 --> 00:53:35,757
If you want to know,
why don't you put it to a test.

1135
00:53:35,978 --> 00:53:37,188
– A test?
– A test?

1136
00:53:37,313 --> 00:53:40,858
Personally, I think someone who
can cook is very feminine.

1137
00:53:40,983 --> 00:53:43,152
So maybe you should see
who cooks better?

1138
00:53:45,296 --> 00:53:47,339
Okay, let's begin the challenge!

1139
00:53:47,693 --> 00:53:50,982
The one who makes
the tastiest food pills wins.

1140
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:53,323
<i>You just watch, Sakura.</i>

1141
00:53:53,566 --> 00:53:55,889
<i>I know what you like
and dislike.</i>

1142
00:53:56,078 --> 00:53:59,248
<i>I just have to make something
that'll make you gag.</i>

1143
00:53:59,877 --> 00:54:01,811
The judge will be Choji.

1144
00:54:02,046 --> 00:54:04,298
Huh?! You're not going
to eat it?!

1145
00:54:04,527 --> 00:54:05,508
Fine with me!

1146
00:54:05,802 --> 00:54:08,305
I just ate a mountain
of ice cream,

1147
00:54:08,386 --> 00:54:10,388
but I always have room
for food pills!

1148
00:54:11,197 --> 00:54:12,198
W-Wait!

1149
00:54:12,358 --> 00:54:14,291
Choji's my teammate.

1150
00:54:14,387 --> 00:54:16,134
That gives me the edge!

1151
00:54:16,413 --> 00:54:19,791
You should be okay with
having the advantage…

1152
00:54:20,065 --> 00:54:21,222
Don't tell me…

1153
00:54:21,247 --> 00:54:23,982
You weren't planning to poison them
to make me sick, were you?

1154
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:25,897
Like I would!

1155
00:54:26,208 --> 00:54:28,110
Come on, let's get started!

1156
00:54:28,404 --> 00:54:29,550
Okay, without further ado!

1157
00:54:29,758 --> 00:54:32,584
The food pill contest to see
who's more feminine, begins!

1158
00:54:32,952 --> 00:54:35,329
Ready, fight!

1159
00:54:41,562 --> 00:54:43,354
Whoa, what's this?!

1160
00:54:43,851 --> 00:54:45,615
Instead of using
a mortar and pestle,

1161
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,475
she uses her fine chakra control

1162
00:54:47,544 --> 00:54:49,489
to get the ingredients
to the desired size.

1163
00:54:49,514 --> 00:54:50,850
I can't wait to taste
the sensation

1164
00:54:50,875 --> 00:54:52,218
when I put it in my mouth!

1165
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:55,975
Whoa!

1166
00:54:56,058 --> 00:54:58,978
She's searing the ingredients
with super-fire power!

1167
00:54:59,263 --> 00:55:02,328
Sakura is using some
legendary golden honey.

1168
00:55:02,813 --> 00:55:04,550
Ino is using cacao powder.

1169
00:55:04,609 --> 00:55:06,152
Both seem irresistible!

1170
00:55:09,624 --> 00:55:11,198
<i>Th-This is…?!</i>

1171
00:55:21,174 --> 00:55:22,335
Th-This is…

1172
00:55:24,295 --> 00:55:25,183
Yummy!

1173
00:55:25,338 --> 00:55:27,798
So delicious!

1174
00:55:28,065 --> 00:55:30,401
<i>Rich, yet not too overpowering…
That indescribable something</i>

1175
00:55:30,426 --> 00:55:31,969
<i>that explodes when
it hits your tongue…</i>

1176
00:55:32,048 --> 00:55:34,322
<i>That delicate aroma
and taste that lingers…</i>

1177
00:55:34,499 --> 00:55:36,667
<i>It's a treasure chest
of sweetness!</i>

1178
00:55:36,974 --> 00:55:37,831
Choji!

1179
00:55:38,284 --> 00:55:39,577
So? Which is it?

1180
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:41,074
Which one tastes better?

1181
00:55:41,103 --> 00:55:43,939
Oh, I wolfed both down,
so I can't tell.

1182
00:55:45,274 --> 00:55:48,486
But they were both really…good…

1183
00:55:52,975 --> 00:55:54,158
– Choji!
– Choji!

1184
00:55:54,299 --> 00:55:55,884
Choji! Choji!

1185
00:56:08,148 --> 00:56:11,170
<i>I've made a lot of friends too.</i>

1186
00:56:11,874 --> 00:56:13,563
Noooo!

1187
00:56:13,862 --> 00:56:16,072
Choji! Don't die!

1188
00:56:16,156 --> 00:56:17,198
What's happening?

1189
00:56:17,445 --> 00:56:19,489
Is his life flashing
before his eyes?

1190
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:21,134
Ino!

1191
00:56:21,159 --> 00:56:22,661
You did used poison,
didn't you?!

1192
00:56:22,797 --> 00:56:24,257
You know I wouldn't!

1193
00:56:24,282 --> 00:56:26,201
Just who do
you think I am, anyway?!

1194
00:56:26,789 --> 00:56:28,918
I've made…a lot of friends…

1195
00:56:29,229 --> 00:56:30,169
This is bad!

1196
00:56:30,243 --> 00:56:32,579
Choji's delirium is getting worse!

1197
00:56:34,338 --> 00:56:35,339
What are you doing?

1198
00:56:35,364 --> 00:56:39,242
I have to see what's inside it
before I can treat him.

1199
00:56:39,453 --> 00:56:42,033
If there's poison in it,
my tongue will go numb…

1200
00:56:42,336 --> 00:56:44,546
I told you,
there's no poison inside!

1201
00:56:45,042 --> 00:56:46,043
Damn it!

1202
00:56:49,399 --> 00:56:50,203
It's delicious!

1203
00:56:50,385 --> 00:56:51,003
Uh-huh!

1204
00:56:51,198 --> 00:56:52,074
Why?

1205
00:56:52,251 --> 00:56:53,961
I really love this taste.

1206
00:56:54,154 --> 00:56:55,905
Me too! I love this flavor!

1207
00:56:56,284 --> 00:56:58,453
Boy, that surprised me.

1208
00:56:58,586 --> 00:57:00,284
I ate too many sweets…

1209
00:57:00,446 --> 00:57:03,074
Seems my blood sugar shot up.

1210
00:57:03,102 --> 00:57:04,437
But I'm okay now!

1211
00:57:04,746 --> 00:57:05,997
Is that all?

1212
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:07,315
Thank goodness.

1213
00:57:07,353 --> 00:57:08,308
Hey, Ino.

1214
00:57:08,333 --> 00:57:10,793
Why would you go out of the way
to make something I love?

1215
00:57:10,957 --> 00:57:12,118
Well…

1216
00:57:12,378 --> 00:57:16,007
I figured if I surprised you with
a flavor you'd love, I'd win.

1217
00:57:16,295 --> 00:57:18,279
What, really?

1218
00:57:18,613 --> 00:57:20,407
That was my strategy too!

1219
00:57:20,566 --> 00:57:22,434
Huh?! You too?

1220
00:57:22,459 --> 00:57:25,212
No wonder I love how it tastes!

1221
00:57:28,382 --> 00:57:31,760
Ultimately, we saw right
through each other.

1222
00:57:32,177 --> 00:57:33,970
Okay, since we know
each other so well,

1223
00:57:33,995 --> 00:57:35,622
there's something
I want to say to you.

1224
00:57:35,825 --> 00:57:36,910
What is it?

1225
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:39,884
Don't you think we'd find
something even better

1226
00:57:40,082 --> 00:57:42,577
if we looked for
a wedding gift together?

1227
00:57:44,515 --> 00:57:45,516
What now?

1228
00:57:46,006 --> 00:57:48,300
I was thinking the same thing.

1229
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:52,093
That inn seems nice.

1230
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:52,978
Huh?

1231
00:57:53,147 --> 00:57:54,552
<i>I'd better hurry up
and choose or</i>

1232
00:57:54,577 --> 00:57:57,225
<i>I'll just keep mulling over
this wedding gift.</i>

1233
00:57:57,478 --> 00:57:59,397
<i>I just have to pick something!</i>

1234
00:58:00,033 --> 00:58:01,058
Okay. Let's go in!

1235
00:58:01,379 --> 00:58:02,277
Huh?!

1236
00:58:02,461 --> 00:58:03,254
What's the matter?

1237
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:05,581
Weren't we just going to…
look around?

1238
00:58:05,606 --> 00:58:09,152
Yeah, but we have to go inside
or we can't make a decision.

1239
00:58:09,177 --> 00:58:11,971
No, but…
I'm not mentally prepared…

1240
00:58:12,498 --> 00:58:14,304
<i>What? Mentally prepared?</i>

1241
00:58:14,576 --> 00:58:16,765
<i>Is she panicking because
this place too fancy?</i>

1242
00:58:17,071 --> 00:58:18,216
It's okay.

1243
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:20,493
Temari, let's just go inside
and then we can decide.

1244
00:58:20,704 --> 00:58:22,915
I-It'll be too late once
we go inside!

1245
00:58:23,059 --> 00:58:25,606
I might get caught up
in the mood…

1246
00:58:26,007 --> 00:58:27,925
<i>What's she talking about?
The mood?</i>

1247
00:58:28,229 --> 00:58:29,906
<i>The mood of that inn?</i>

1248
00:58:29,958 --> 00:58:31,918
<i>What does she mean
by getting caught up in it?</i>

1249
00:58:32,143 --> 00:58:33,478
<i>I don't get it!</i>

1250
00:58:34,597 --> 00:58:35,765
Hey…you don't…

1251
00:58:36,521 --> 00:58:37,915
…have a fever, do you?

1252
00:58:38,109 --> 00:58:40,684
I-I'm going home!

1253
00:58:40,709 --> 00:58:42,752
H-Hey, wait!
It's gonna get dark soon!

1254
00:58:43,323 --> 00:58:44,824
If you're not feeling well,

1255
00:58:44,987 --> 00:58:47,448
we really should book
a room and rest!

1256
00:58:48,602 --> 00:58:49,603
Please wait!

1257
00:58:49,668 --> 00:58:52,269
I really…need you!

1258
00:58:53,405 --> 00:58:55,460
Are you sure…I'm the one?

1259
00:58:55,879 --> 00:58:58,100
Yeah! You're the only one!

1260
00:59:02,584 --> 00:59:05,762
Besides, I can't go into
the women's bath.

1261
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:06,592
What?

1262
00:59:07,067 --> 00:59:09,329
Temari, I need you to go
into the women's bath

1263
00:59:09,616 --> 00:59:12,661
and report back
every detail to me.

1264
00:59:12,996 --> 00:59:15,488
That's all. Easy, right?

1265
00:59:15,838 --> 00:59:16,794
So, uh…

1266
00:59:17,018 --> 00:59:18,728
Just what is this all
about anyway?

1267
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:22,083
What else? I'm going
to gift Naruto and Hinata

1268
00:59:22,108 --> 00:59:24,164
a honeymoon for
their wedding gift,

1269
00:59:24,189 --> 00:59:25,257
and I need to choose the inn.

1270
00:59:25,402 --> 00:59:27,784
Oh...So that's it.

1271
00:59:27,921 --> 00:59:30,381
Huh? Didn't I…tell you?

1272
00:59:30,449 --> 00:59:32,698
This is the first
I've heard about it.

1273
00:59:39,963 --> 00:59:43,158
So, you're back to square one
in your search for a wedding gift?

1274
00:59:43,376 --> 00:59:43,976
Yeah…

1275
00:59:44,054 --> 00:59:46,264
But I think it turned out
for the best.

1276
00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:48,880
What about you, Shikamaru?

1277
00:59:49,069 --> 00:59:51,280
Trying to explain
everything is a drag…

1278
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:05,184
Welcome.

1279
01:00:05,513 --> 01:00:07,315
It's been a while Lord Sixth.

1280
01:00:09,545 --> 01:00:10,925
I apologize for being late.

1281
01:00:11,416 --> 01:00:14,145
Have the other Kage
arrived already?

1282
01:00:15,027 --> 01:00:18,239
Yes, they just arrived.

1283
01:00:20,991 --> 01:00:23,285
I don't see the Mizukage…

1284
01:00:23,457 --> 01:00:26,038
Due to inclement weather en route,

1285
01:00:26,038 --> 01:00:28,999
they are running about
a half a day behind.

1286
01:00:29,238 --> 01:00:30,396
During this time,

1287
01:00:30,421 --> 01:00:32,923
please relax and enjoy what
our village has to offer.

1288
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:35,965
I've assigned Hidden Leaf shinobi
to accompany you.

1289
01:00:36,711 --> 01:00:38,400
By the way, Lord Sixth.

1290
01:00:38,425 --> 01:00:40,970
I understand Naruto is
going to marry.

1291
01:00:41,345 --> 01:00:42,846
Yes, so you've heard?

1292
01:00:43,102 --> 01:00:47,685
I've prepared a wedding gift
from the Hidden Rock.

1293
01:00:47,893 --> 01:00:51,021
May I ask you to present it
at the wedding celebration?

1294
01:00:51,021 --> 01:00:54,108
The Hidden Cloud will
also be sending a gift.

1295
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:55,818
I ask the same of you.

1296
01:00:56,386 --> 01:00:57,387
I understand.

1297
01:00:57,644 --> 01:00:59,654
I'm sure Naruto will
be very happy.

1298
01:01:00,253 --> 01:01:02,676
Naruto…is getting married, huh?

1299
01:01:03,681 --> 01:01:06,809
We didn't hear anything about
Naruto getting married!

1300
01:01:07,132 --> 01:01:10,499
Temari, you were here just
a little while ago…

1301
01:01:10,524 --> 01:01:11,681
You must've heard about it!

1302
01:01:11,706 --> 01:01:12,582
Y-Yeah…

1303
01:01:12,975 --> 01:01:14,619
Why didn't you tell us?!

1304
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:19,049
Shut up! I forgot, okay?!

1305
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:20,843
What's come over you?

1306
01:01:20,868 --> 01:01:22,578
Y-You're being scary.

1307
01:01:23,377 --> 01:01:27,224
In any case, we should
prepare a wedding gift.

1308
01:01:27,641 --> 01:01:30,201
Since it will be from the Kazekage,
we should get something extravagant.

1309
01:01:30,522 --> 01:01:31,731
Extravagant, huh?

1310
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,143
Do you think Naruto would
appreciate that?

1311
01:01:34,571 --> 01:01:37,532
You think Naruto wouldn't be happy
with something extravagant?

1312
01:01:44,045 --> 01:01:45,547
When you put it that way…

1313
01:01:45,716 --> 01:01:47,802
Gaara! It's been a very long time!

1314
01:01:48,908 --> 01:01:50,108
Yes, it certainly has.

1315
01:01:50,133 --> 01:01:53,767
We are going to show you
around the village

1316
01:01:53,792 --> 01:01:56,128
until Lord Mizukage arrives!

1317
01:01:56,269 --> 01:01:57,489
Hey, Lee.

1318
01:01:57,588 --> 01:02:00,257
He's here for
the Five Kage Conference

1319
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:02,286
and we're on duty as well.

1320
01:02:02,426 --> 01:02:04,803
Don't get too casual.

1321
01:02:04,874 --> 01:02:07,374
No, let's not stand on ceremony.

1322
01:02:07,556 --> 01:02:08,702
We appreciate your company.

1323
01:02:08,727 --> 01:02:10,062
We're looking forward to it.

1324
01:02:10,225 --> 01:02:13,856
So, is there somewhere
you want to go first?

1325
01:02:14,593 --> 01:02:15,927
Let's see…

1326
01:02:16,398 --> 01:02:19,276
Actually, I want to know
what kinds of things Naruto likes.

1327
01:02:19,425 --> 01:02:21,945
What Naruto likes?

1328
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:23,393
Let's see…

1329
01:02:24,453 --> 01:02:26,367
I know just the place!

1330
01:02:26,508 --> 01:02:27,827
I'll take you there now!

1331
01:02:28,032 --> 01:02:29,870
Great. Are you both coming?

1332
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:31,038
Of course!

1333
01:02:34,384 --> 01:02:36,725
I'm just going to relax here.

1334
01:02:37,429 --> 01:02:39,811
<i>It will be awkward if I run into him.</i>

1335
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:41,975
What's up, Temari?

1336
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:43,405
You seem weirdly irritated…

1337
01:02:44,385 --> 01:02:46,053
There's nothing going on!

1338
01:02:46,136 --> 01:02:48,180
You guys just go!

1339
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:55,676
Hello!

1340
01:02:55,746 --> 01:02:58,457
Oh! Welcome, Iruka Sensei!

1341
01:02:59,174 --> 01:03:01,235
I'd like a large miso char siu ramen.

1342
01:03:01,543 --> 01:03:02,539
Sure thing!

1343
01:03:02,849 --> 01:03:06,353
But, Iruka Sensei, you've been
coming around a lot lately.

1344
01:03:06,389 --> 01:03:08,182
Don't be rude, Ayame!

1345
01:03:08,339 --> 01:03:09,840
He's a very important customer!

1346
01:03:11,713 --> 01:03:15,300
What's going on with you?
You seem to be troubled.

1347
01:03:15,699 --> 01:03:16,700
Well…

1348
01:03:17,435 --> 01:03:20,354
Everyone's in a tizzy over
what to get Naruto

1349
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:22,214
for his wedding gift for
the past few days.

1350
01:03:22,297 --> 01:03:24,091
It doesn't involve me
since I'm not a shinobi.

1351
01:03:24,166 --> 01:03:27,210
But I still want to give him something.
And I came up with…

1352
01:03:27,235 --> 01:03:28,575
this!

1353
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:30,628
A free ramen pass?

1354
01:03:31,703 --> 01:03:32,769
Oh! Not this.

1355
01:03:36,645 --> 01:03:40,983
I see...He gets to eat free ramen
for a limited time.

1356
01:03:41,395 --> 01:03:43,678
I'm sure this'll make him
very happy.

1357
01:03:43,703 --> 01:03:46,367
But I wonder about a whole year…

1358
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:13,515
A year is too long.

1359
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:14,731
Too long…

1360
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:18,694
It's the same with half a year.

1361
01:04:19,062 --> 01:04:20,653
Yeah, you're right…

1362
01:04:21,809 --> 01:04:22,644
I see.

1363
01:04:23,057 --> 01:04:26,028
You want to give Naruto
a wedding gift too?

1364
01:04:26,445 --> 01:04:27,905
He'll definitely be overjoyed!

1365
01:04:28,054 --> 01:04:31,766
So, does that mean
you have something already, Lee?

1366
01:04:31,825 --> 01:04:32,826
Of course!

1367
01:04:32,851 --> 01:04:33,852
I see.

1368
01:04:34,366 --> 01:04:37,080
This is the first time I'm getting
something like a wedding gift.

1369
01:04:37,391 --> 01:04:40,667
I don't have a clue
on what to get.

1370
01:04:40,747 --> 01:04:45,627
Then you must consider what
a wedding is in the first place!

1371
01:04:47,257 --> 01:04:49,843
<i>What is a wedding ceremony?</i>

1372
01:04:50,273 --> 01:04:53,222
<i>What is absolutely necessary
for a wedding ceremony?</i>

1373
01:04:53,554 --> 01:04:55,913
<i>Wouldn't that be…love?</i>

1374
01:04:56,537 --> 01:04:58,460
<i>I'm getting a bad feeling
about this…</i>

1375
01:04:58,571 --> 01:05:01,114
"What is a wedding ceremony?"

1376
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:03,999
That's a very philosophical question.

1377
01:05:04,076 --> 01:05:05,177
Yes, it is.

1378
01:05:05,403 --> 01:05:07,613
So think about it this way…

1379
01:05:07,947 --> 01:05:11,242
What is absolutely necessary
for a wedding ceremony?

1380
01:05:11,406 --> 01:05:13,867
Absolutely necessary for
a wedding…?

1381
01:05:14,409 --> 01:05:17,366
Wouldn't that be…love?

1382
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:21,391
Yes!

1383
01:05:21,595 --> 01:05:23,846
That was my answer too!

1384
01:05:23,871 --> 01:05:26,330
Why is this going exactly
the same way as before?!

1385
01:05:27,798 --> 01:05:30,958
However, my mentor whom
I greatly respect, Guy Sensei,

1386
01:05:30,983 --> 01:05:32,776
didn't stop there.

1387
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:34,563
He realized that
it's the bride and groom

1388
01:05:34,654 --> 01:05:36,656
who are most important
in a wedding…

1389
01:05:37,081 --> 01:05:38,851
and if you put yourself
into their shoes,

1390
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:41,979
you would see what would
be the best gift.

1391
01:05:43,566 --> 01:05:45,276
And the result of that was…

1392
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:48,277
I got them dumbbells!

1393
01:05:49,027 --> 01:05:50,946
D-Dumbbells?

1394
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,282
I'm only a shinobi…

1395
01:05:53,365 --> 01:05:55,450
so I think that's most suitable thing
for me to present.

1396
01:05:55,450 --> 01:05:58,579
However, Gaara, you are the Kazekage,
so we must consider your position.

1397
01:05:59,391 --> 01:06:03,403
So, I think some extravagant barbells
would be great!

1398
01:06:04,914 --> 01:06:06,999
B-Barbells, huh…

1399
01:06:07,588 --> 01:06:09,923
I don't know about barbells…

1400
01:06:10,186 --> 01:06:12,820
But I agree with
the "extravagant" part.

1401
01:06:13,546 --> 01:06:15,137
– Hello!
– Welcome!

1402
01:06:15,262 --> 01:06:16,385
Iruka Sensei!

1403
01:06:16,624 --> 01:06:18,876
Hey, Lee! We meet again!

1404
01:06:19,965 --> 01:06:23,517
Gaara, let me introduce Iruka Sensei,
Naruto's teacher.

1405
01:06:24,090 --> 01:06:27,093
Iruka Sensei,
this is Gaara the Kazekage!

1406
01:06:27,118 --> 01:06:29,079
H-How do you do?

1407
01:06:29,629 --> 01:06:32,420
Why is Lord Kazekage
with you two?

1408
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:35,867
We've been assigned to show him
around the village

1409
01:06:35,892 --> 01:06:38,019
until the Five Kage Conference begins.

1410
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:42,463
Gaara is also thinking about
a wedding gift for Naruto.

1411
01:06:42,988 --> 01:06:45,790
Naruto and Gaara are friends.

1412
01:06:46,463 --> 01:06:47,544
Friends?!

1413
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:54,178
Anyway, we're going to send an extravagant
gift representative of the Hidden Sand.

1414
01:06:54,555 --> 01:06:56,862
I'm very grateful to
the Lord Kazekage

1415
01:06:56,887 --> 01:06:59,581
for making such
an extravagant gesture…

1416
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:02,434
and I'm sure Naruto will
be overjoyed as well.

1417
01:07:02,955 --> 01:07:04,853
Now, if you will please excuse me.

1418
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:14,404
See? Naruto's gonna be happy!

1419
01:07:14,617 --> 01:07:16,911
His own teacher confirmed that.

1420
01:07:17,032 --> 01:07:18,200
You think so?

1421
01:07:18,283 --> 01:07:21,328
One thing's for sure,
Naruto loves flashy things!

1422
01:07:21,428 --> 01:07:24,765
There's no way he won't be happy
with an extravagant gift.

1423
01:07:25,224 --> 01:07:26,231
I see…

1424
01:07:26,568 --> 01:07:28,277
I guess I'm gonna go
big and grand too,

1425
01:07:28,302 --> 01:07:29,804
and give him a year's free pass—

1426
01:07:29,829 --> 01:07:30,955
Father…

1427
01:07:32,691 --> 01:07:33,376
Y-Yes…

1428
01:07:33,966 --> 01:07:36,820
Pops, I'll have a large
miso char siu ramen!

1429
01:07:36,918 --> 01:07:37,919
What is that?

1430
01:07:38,595 --> 01:07:40,659
Naruto's favorite item
on the menu.

1431
01:07:40,768 --> 01:07:43,195
It has an extravagant helping
of char sui.

1432
01:07:43,809 --> 01:07:45,602
Even his ramen is extravagant?

1433
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:48,503
Then I'll have that too.

1434
01:07:48,528 --> 01:07:49,696
Me too.

1435
01:07:50,063 --> 01:07:51,291
Okay, Pops…

1436
01:07:51,483 --> 01:07:54,611
A large miso char siu ramen
for all of us!

1437
01:07:54,636 --> 01:07:55,678
Hold it!

1438
01:07:55,799 --> 01:07:59,511
Make mine a regular,
without char siu, and for the topping…

1439
01:07:59,602 --> 01:08:00,728
Topping?

1440
01:08:01,390 --> 01:08:03,392
Seems Naruto fish cake
is ranked number one.

1441
01:08:03,942 --> 01:08:07,403
way back, it used to be
the least popular.

1442
01:08:07,561 --> 01:08:09,646
These days, it's Naruto fish cake,
hands down.

1443
01:08:09,918 --> 01:08:11,712
That's the kinda effect he's had.

1444
01:08:11,819 --> 01:08:15,382
Then I'll have the regular miso
ramen, with the Naruto fishcake topping.

1445
01:08:15,945 --> 01:08:18,781
Please add that to mine too.

1446
01:08:18,945 --> 01:08:22,784
All right! I'll give you an extravagant
helping of the topping!

1447
01:08:25,537 --> 01:08:27,384
Boy, did we eat.

1448
01:08:28,196 --> 01:08:30,377
Where would you like to go next?

1449
01:08:31,898 --> 01:08:33,233
Are you all right?

1450
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:36,403
You've been deep in thought
this whole time.

1451
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:41,057
I was thinking about what
to give Naruto as the Kazekage.

1452
01:08:41,577 --> 01:08:42,870
As the Kazekage?

1453
01:08:43,187 --> 01:08:45,431
Kankuro wants to give
something extravagant,

1454
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,644
but that just doesn't sit right with me.

1455
01:08:48,139 --> 01:08:49,349
I see…

1456
01:08:49,374 --> 01:08:51,126
Hey, c'mon, Gaara…

1457
01:08:52,002 --> 01:08:53,420
But after listening to
Naruto's teacher

1458
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:56,006
and the ramen shop's proprietor,
I'm convinced.

1459
01:08:56,131 --> 01:08:58,091
As long as it makes Naruto happy.

1460
01:08:58,216 --> 01:08:59,760
That's more like it!

1461
01:08:59,785 --> 01:09:02,329
I'll help in any way I can too!

1462
01:09:04,092 --> 01:09:04,837
– Huh?
– Huh?

1463
01:09:06,089 --> 01:09:06,735
Huh?

1464
01:09:07,817 --> 01:09:11,070
Hey, you Hidden Sand
and Leaf guys!

1465
01:09:11,271 --> 01:09:13,857
Guess who I am, yay!

1466
01:09:14,176 --> 01:09:15,361
<i>What an awful rap…</i>

1467
01:09:15,769 --> 01:09:18,557
You're Lord Killer Bee,
the bodyguard of Lord Raikage, right?

1468
01:09:19,017 --> 01:09:21,573
Isn't anyone accompanying you
in the village?

1469
01:09:21,656 --> 01:09:24,951
I prefer my freedom.

1470
01:09:25,527 --> 01:09:27,913
My brother's at
the conference reception.

1471
01:09:28,182 --> 01:09:30,685
Me, I prefer a village exploration.

1472
01:09:30,813 --> 01:09:35,175
By the way, Kazekage, are you
planning on giving Naruto a wedding gift?

1473
01:09:35,518 --> 01:09:37,187
Yes, I intend to.

1474
01:09:37,593 --> 01:09:40,606
Finding a gift is
my personal mission.

1475
01:09:40,761 --> 01:09:43,503
Let's do our best to make
a good decision, yay.

1476
01:09:43,815 --> 01:09:46,776
Sounds like the Hidden Cloud
are really into this.

1477
01:09:47,032 --> 01:09:49,076
Our gift will be something
to marvel at.

1478
01:09:49,101 --> 01:09:51,228
Listen well and remember that.

1479
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:54,543
<i>Seriously? Do you have to answer
in rap all the time?</i>

1480
01:09:55,392 --> 01:09:56,943
Decorated for a special occasion…

1481
01:09:56,978 --> 01:09:59,147
Sake produced by the Hidden Cloud…

1482
01:09:59,172 --> 01:10:01,633
Ten giant kegs of which
we're proud, yay.

1483
01:10:02,010 --> 01:10:04,800
Hidden Cloud beef of
super high-quality…

1484
01:10:04,825 --> 01:10:09,330
We'll present it roasted whole,
in its entirety, yay.

1485
01:10:10,267 --> 01:10:11,832
Premium games…

1486
01:10:11,915 --> 01:10:14,000
The best of the best.

1487
01:10:14,084 --> 01:10:16,128
Ten great games, no less. Yay!

1488
01:10:16,211 --> 01:10:17,879
That sums up my presentation.

1489
01:10:17,963 --> 01:10:19,881
A wedding's an important celebration.

1490
01:10:19,906 --> 01:10:20,907
Yay.

1491
01:10:21,341 --> 01:10:23,051
A-Amazing!

1492
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:26,596
I didn't get the details
because of your rap…

1493
01:10:26,826 --> 01:10:29,203
but I did get that
it'll be extravagant.

1494
01:10:29,382 --> 01:10:33,124
So what's the Hidden Sand getting?

1495
01:10:33,369 --> 01:10:35,772
Have you already ordered it?

1496
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:38,156
Well…that's just it.

1497
01:10:38,674 --> 01:10:39,753
Okay! Okay!

1498
01:10:39,778 --> 01:10:41,880
I apologize, I should have realized…

1499
01:10:42,204 --> 01:10:45,052
Our gifts are so extravagant
that it's made you hesitant.

1500
01:10:45,077 --> 01:10:47,246
But that's not important.

1501
01:10:47,451 --> 01:10:47,995
Huh?

1502
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:49,828
Doesn't matter
if it's not fancy,

1503
01:10:49,921 --> 01:10:52,048
what comes from the heart
is the best choice.

1504
01:10:52,093 --> 01:10:53,761
That's what'll make
Naruto rejoice, yay!

1505
01:10:54,958 --> 01:10:56,960
Don't patronize us!

1506
01:10:57,769 --> 01:10:58,962
K-Kankuro?!

1507
01:10:58,987 --> 01:11:02,449
We're gonna give a gift that
equals the Hidden Cloud's!

1508
01:11:03,327 --> 01:11:07,167
We plan to cover the reception hall
with flowers grown in the Hidden Sand!

1509
01:11:07,994 --> 01:11:10,320
And to highlight
the celebration dinner,

1510
01:11:10,544 --> 01:11:12,649
we'll send the finest tuna
in the land…a whole bluefin!

1511
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:17,971
And we'll prepare boxes of sweets
as wedding favors for every guest!

1512
01:11:18,994 --> 01:11:20,817
How's that?!

1513
01:11:20,944 --> 01:11:22,277
Hold it. Who said anything about—?

1514
01:11:22,277 --> 01:11:23,380
Amazing!

1515
01:11:23,455 --> 01:11:26,813
You came up with all that
in such a short time!

1516
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,950
No…we haven't decided—

1517
01:11:30,101 --> 01:11:33,216
Oh, I forgot something important.

1518
01:11:33,241 --> 01:11:35,035
Fool, ya fool.

1519
01:11:35,515 --> 01:11:40,754
For entertainment, Brother might perchance…
perform the "Hidden Cloud Dance."

1520
01:11:40,834 --> 01:11:42,132
Yay.

1521
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:43,910
The Raikage…

1522
01:11:43,935 --> 01:11:46,228
The Hidden Cloud Dance, you say?!

1523
01:11:46,346 --> 01:11:48,390
No, no, no...no way, no way…

1524
01:11:48,533 --> 01:11:50,160
So now you get the drift…

1525
01:11:50,289 --> 01:11:53,674
How the party will get a lift, yay

1526
01:11:56,502 --> 01:11:59,130
T-This is bad! At this rate…

1527
01:11:59,155 --> 01:12:00,490
Gaara will lose!

1528
01:12:00,899 --> 01:12:03,860
No, giving a gift isn't
about winning or losing.

1529
01:12:04,388 --> 01:12:05,670
Dance...

1530
01:12:05,695 --> 01:12:06,488
Huh?

1531
01:12:06,696 --> 01:12:08,281
Show up the Raikage…

1532
01:12:08,365 --> 01:12:10,867
and dance too, Gaara!

1533
01:12:10,867 --> 01:12:13,411
That is the only way!

1534
01:12:15,584 --> 01:12:18,212
The Mizukage should be arriving soon.

1535
01:12:18,662 --> 01:12:21,307
Then we should call the Kazekage.

1536
01:12:24,005 --> 01:12:24,786
Lord Kakashi…

1537
01:12:24,811 --> 01:12:26,448
Drop the "lord."

1538
01:12:28,051 --> 01:12:30,637
We received a request to
adjust the entertainment time

1539
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:34,557
allotted at Naruto and Hinata's
wedding reception.

1540
01:12:34,817 --> 01:12:36,485
Huh? What's that?

1541
01:12:36,937 --> 01:12:39,352
How come I wasn't told about
a wedding reception?!

1542
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:40,510
At whose request?

1543
01:12:40,742 --> 01:12:43,787
It's from…Lord Raikage's bodyguard…

1544
01:12:44,092 --> 01:12:44,971
What?!

1545
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:49,364
He mentioned
the "Hidden Cloud Dance" by the Raikage.

1546
01:12:49,364 --> 01:12:52,951
Okay! Gaara will do
the "Hidden Sand Samba."

1547
01:12:52,976 --> 01:12:55,437
Oh! This is getting more
and more exciting.

1548
01:12:55,578 --> 01:12:58,457
Stop joking. I can't dance.

1549
01:12:59,091 --> 01:13:01,677
Besides, it wouldn't make
Naruto happy.

1550
01:13:02,009 --> 01:13:05,846
Actually, I think he might take
the initiative and join in.

1551
01:13:06,172 --> 01:13:07,632
W-What…?!

1552
01:13:11,904 --> 01:13:12,802
Y-You're right.

1553
01:13:12,827 --> 01:13:13,953
Still…

1554
01:13:13,978 --> 01:13:17,019
The Kazekage shouldn't dance
in front of people!

1555
01:13:17,091 --> 01:13:19,552
But he said the Raikage
is going to dance!

1556
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:27,326
The Raikage's gift of dance
is a must-see

1557
01:13:27,466 --> 01:13:31,029
If you miss this opportunity,
behind the times you'll be, yay.

1558
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:34,200
That fool!

1559
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:39,207
I beg your pardon if
I make a scene…

1560
01:13:39,998 --> 01:13:43,918
No, I doubt there will be
a need for you to intervene.

1561
01:13:43,943 --> 01:13:47,321
The Raikage's wedding gift
of dance is a must-see

1562
01:13:47,464 --> 01:13:50,717
If you miss this opportunity,
behind the times you'll be, yay.

1563
01:13:51,104 --> 01:13:53,216
Wedding...Behind the times?

1564
01:13:55,699 --> 01:13:56,642
I'll kill you.

1565
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:05,788
I now call this Five Kage
Conference to order.

1566
01:14:10,486 --> 01:14:12,087
However, before we begin…

1567
01:14:12,864 --> 01:14:16,284
In regard to wedding gifts for
Naruto Uzumaki and Hinata Hyuga…

1568
01:14:16,328 --> 01:14:21,124
I ask that you use your good sense and
keep things in moderation.

1569
01:14:23,106 --> 01:14:26,234
And so, let's move on
to our agenda.

1570
01:14:33,802 --> 01:14:35,053
H-Hey…

1571
01:14:41,021 --> 01:14:43,844
S-Sorry about last time.

1572
01:14:44,115 --> 01:14:45,574
No...I'm sorry as well.

1573
01:14:46,310 --> 01:14:48,483
Want to get a bite to eat?

1574
01:14:55,075 --> 01:14:56,535
Might as well…

1575
01:15:18,555 --> 01:15:19,689
Lord Kazekage…

1576
01:15:19,873 --> 01:15:21,916
So, you were still here in the village!

1577
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:25,120
The conference ran long…

1578
01:15:25,145 --> 01:15:27,064
So, I decided to stay the night.

1579
01:15:27,814 --> 01:15:31,818
I'm grateful that you've chosen
our ramen for dinner!

1580
01:15:32,234 --> 01:15:35,100
Well...I've never had anything
so delicious.

1581
01:15:35,368 --> 01:15:37,480
And I've never had such
a compliment.

1582
01:15:38,118 --> 01:15:42,205
By the way, I heard about
the remarks Lord Hokage made

1583
01:15:42,328 --> 01:15:44,456
about Naruto and Hinata's wedding gifts…

1584
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:46,028
It was to be expected.

1585
01:15:46,332 --> 01:15:48,668
Things were getting out of hand.

1586
01:15:48,944 --> 01:15:52,531
I'm sure everyone's feeling
remorseful now.

1587
01:15:54,812 --> 01:15:56,439
Even I…

1588
01:15:56,944 --> 01:16:00,114
And I went overboard too.
I apologize.

1589
01:16:00,346 --> 01:16:01,806
Don't worry about it.

1590
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:03,183
Oh! Iruka Sensei.

1591
01:16:03,394 --> 01:16:04,248
Welcome!

1592
01:16:05,768 --> 01:16:08,897
Lord Kazekage…
I just overheard you.

1593
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:11,107
I want to apologize too.

1594
01:16:11,191 --> 01:16:13,151
But Naruto's teacher shouldn't…

1595
01:16:13,443 --> 01:16:15,612
When I met you last time…

1596
01:16:16,025 --> 01:16:18,111
<i>I'm very grateful to
the Lord Kazekage</i>

1597
01:16:18,136 --> 01:16:21,264
<i>for making such
an extravagant gesture…</i>

1598
01:16:21,432 --> 01:16:23,934
<i>and I'm sure Naruto will
be overjoyed as well.</i>

1599
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:27,332
I'm at fault too,
for putting it like that.

1600
01:16:28,249 --> 01:16:30,168
I'm very sorry.

1601
01:16:30,627 --> 01:16:33,087
There's nothing to be sorry about!

1602
01:16:34,255 --> 01:16:37,550
I was just…simply happy.

1603
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:40,381
I learned that Naruto
has wonderful friends

1604
01:16:40,707 --> 01:16:43,556
who will go above and beyond
to celebrate him.

1605
01:16:44,557 --> 01:16:46,184
Friends…huh.

1606
01:16:46,944 --> 01:16:48,946
Thank you very much.

1607
01:16:49,016 --> 01:16:51,227
No, I want to thank you too.

1608
01:16:51,439 --> 01:16:52,089
Huh?

1609
01:16:52,836 --> 01:16:55,336
I was confused,
and you've cleared it up for me.

1610
01:16:56,027 --> 01:16:59,030
I was thinking only
about appearances,

1611
01:16:59,113 --> 01:17:01,699
and forgot the most basic thing.

1612
01:17:02,244 --> 01:17:03,662
What do you mean?

1613
01:17:05,078 --> 01:17:07,348
I'm going to honor Naruto not
as the Kazekage,

1614
01:17:07,425 --> 01:17:09,748
but as his friend.

1615
01:17:10,661 --> 01:17:12,246
Would that be all right?

1616
01:17:15,088 --> 01:17:16,256
Of course.

1617
01:17:16,631 --> 01:17:19,842
A large miso char siu ramen
with Naruto fishcake topping!

1618
01:17:19,867 --> 01:17:21,160
Oh, thank you.

1619
01:17:21,223 --> 01:17:22,808
What'll you have, Iruka Sensei?

1620
01:17:22,873 --> 01:17:23,916
Make mine the same…

1621
01:17:23,941 --> 01:17:26,319
A large miso char siu ramen
with Naruto fishcake topping.

1622
01:17:26,599 --> 01:17:27,600
Coming right up!

1623
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:33,064
Dad, I'm done cleaning up here.

1624
01:17:33,147 --> 01:17:34,607
Okay, thanks!

1625
01:17:34,691 --> 01:17:36,072
Not going home yet?

1626
01:17:36,097 --> 01:17:37,682
I'm gonna go on ahead.

1627
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:39,779
Make sure you lock up!

1628
01:17:40,290 --> 01:17:41,716
All right...Finished!

1629
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,554
Have a safe trip back home.

1630
01:17:52,917 --> 01:17:55,058
Gaara! Please come again!

1631
01:17:55,404 --> 01:17:57,518
It would be great if you come back
on your own next time,

1632
01:17:57,614 --> 01:17:59,449
and not on official
Kazekage business.

1633
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:02,222
Yes, that won't be
too long from now.

1634
01:18:04,343 --> 01:18:06,077
For Naruto and Hinata's wedding.

1635
01:18:06,421 --> 01:18:08,799
I'm sorry, but I don't plan
on bringing

1636
01:18:08,824 --> 01:18:11,521
a special gift from
the Hidden Sand.

1637
01:18:11,693 --> 01:18:13,153
Huh? Why?

1638
01:18:13,178 --> 01:18:14,179
Let him finish!

1639
01:18:14,226 --> 01:18:17,896
I want to honor them personally,
as a friend.

1640
01:18:18,078 --> 01:18:20,372
I think that will please Naruto more.

1641
01:18:21,101 --> 01:18:22,238
Gaara!

1642
01:18:22,322 --> 01:18:23,531
Gaara…

1643
01:18:24,157 --> 01:18:27,035
Yes, please do that.

1644
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:37,295
I think it turned out for the best.

1645
01:18:37,476 --> 01:18:40,214
Feels like everything's all settled!

1646
01:18:40,298 --> 01:18:42,342
You're in a good mood, Temari.

1647
01:18:42,367 --> 01:18:44,286
N-No, I'm not!

1648
01:18:44,936 --> 01:18:48,982
Besides, seeing you so depressed
is more shocking, Kankuro!

1649
01:18:49,426 --> 01:18:50,617
You can't blame him,

1650
01:18:50,642 --> 01:18:52,693
since we're not going all out
with an extravagant gift.

1651
01:18:52,918 --> 01:18:55,003
No, that doesn't bother me.

1652
01:18:55,229 --> 01:18:58,358
I'm just disappointed we won't get
to see you dance, Gaara.

1653
01:18:58,656 --> 01:19:01,152
No, there's still hope!

1654
01:19:01,318 --> 01:19:03,343
He can dance as Naruto's friend!

1655
01:19:06,225 --> 01:19:07,476
No chance.

1656
01:19:19,504 --> 01:19:21,714
Bugs are super gross!

1657
01:19:21,833 --> 01:19:24,294
There are bugs here too!

1658
01:19:25,009 --> 01:19:27,287
Bugs! Everywhere!

1659
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:31,173
Good job.

1660
01:19:31,853 --> 01:19:33,855
What happened to the ones
who haven't returned?

1661
01:19:34,836 --> 01:19:36,604
What's up with these bugs?

1662
01:19:36,682 --> 01:19:40,728
Chase 'em away, Tsukune!
I can't stand bugs.

1663
01:19:40,858 --> 01:19:43,945
But these aren't ordinary bugs!

1664
01:19:44,754 --> 01:19:45,797
Cut it out, you guys.

1665
01:19:46,531 --> 01:19:49,300
It's because those insects
are my friends.

1666
01:19:49,701 --> 01:19:51,002
– These bugs are your friends?
– These bugs are your friends?

1667
01:19:51,027 --> 01:19:53,231
What's up with this old guy?

1668
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:55,790
Those kids!

1669
01:19:56,165 --> 01:19:58,442
This period is for extracurricular
work. Where did they go?

1670
01:19:58,467 --> 01:20:00,175
– Wow! Amazing!
– Wow! Amazing!

1671
01:20:00,728 --> 01:20:02,021
Cool!

1672
01:20:02,422 --> 01:20:04,106
I've never seen
an Insect User before!

1673
01:20:04,179 --> 01:20:07,210
They'd be a huge hit at a party!

1674
01:20:07,235 --> 01:20:10,638
No way...The party would be
crawling with bugs.

1675
01:20:10,888 --> 01:20:12,572
It seems you don't like insects.

1676
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:16,086
However, if you keep living with them,
you become quite attached to them.

1677
01:20:19,285 --> 01:20:21,983
Y-You're right...They're kinda cute.

1678
01:20:22,275 --> 01:20:23,651
I wanna try too!

1679
01:20:24,390 --> 01:20:26,517
Do you think you want to
become an Insect User?

1680
01:20:26,821 --> 01:20:31,200
Not gonna happen. This guy wants to
become the future Hokage.

1681
01:20:31,552 --> 01:20:32,553
The Hokage?

1682
01:20:33,121 --> 01:20:36,581
I wanna surpass Naruto Uzumaki
as a shinobi.

1683
01:20:37,415 --> 01:20:39,584
I see. Well, if you want to
surpass Naruto,

1684
01:20:39,625 --> 01:20:41,085
you'll have to become the Hokage.

1685
01:20:41,372 --> 01:20:43,249
You think so too?

1686
01:20:43,274 --> 01:20:45,485
Then I guess while I'm at it,
I'll become the Hokage too.

1687
01:20:47,089 --> 01:20:49,719
I know someone else who wants to
become the Hokage.

1688
01:20:50,219 --> 01:20:53,264
But kid, you're the top contender.

1689
01:20:53,571 --> 01:20:56,142
It's because I don't know anyone
who says he'll become the Hokage

1690
01:20:56,167 --> 01:20:57,127
as an afterthought.

1691
01:20:57,366 --> 01:21:00,453
Right? See I'm the top contender!

1692
01:21:00,631 --> 01:21:02,884
You just talk big!

1693
01:21:02,971 --> 01:21:05,098
Shut up! You just watch me
ten years from now!

1694
01:21:05,902 --> 01:21:07,820
Are you aiming to become
the Hokage too?

1695
01:21:08,154 --> 01:21:10,782
No, I never gave it a thought.

1696
01:21:10,782 --> 01:21:13,409
So, you wanted to become
an Insect User?

1697
01:21:13,831 --> 01:21:15,916
Yeah…that's right.

1698
01:21:16,412 --> 01:21:19,791
What's necessary
to realize a dream?

1699
01:21:19,791 --> 01:21:22,668
I want to take that first step
as soon as I can!

1700
01:21:23,644 --> 01:21:26,456
The first step in realizing
your dream is…

1701
01:21:26,839 --> 01:21:28,883
Hey, what time is it?

1702
01:21:29,175 --> 01:21:32,345
Uh-oh! We forgot about class!

1703
01:21:32,804 --> 01:21:36,265
You'd better hurry back.
And do your best to surpass Naruto.

1704
01:21:37,183 --> 01:21:39,268
Yeah! I'm gonna reach my dream,
just like you Big Bro!

1705
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:40,409
See ya!

1706
01:21:44,895 --> 01:21:46,681
Dream…huh?

1707
01:21:48,945 --> 01:21:49,946
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1708
01:21:50,213 --> 01:21:51,756
You're late, Shino!

1709
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:53,214
So? How'd it go?

1710
01:21:53,616 --> 01:21:57,286
It seems just about everyone's
gotten their wedding gift.

1711
01:21:57,578 --> 01:22:00,665
Oh yeah? I guess we'd better
decide soon too.

1712
01:22:02,316 --> 01:22:03,317
Hey, Shino…

1713
01:22:03,610 --> 01:22:06,863
Kakashi Sensei said
this was a mission, right?

1714
01:22:07,672 --> 01:22:11,926
I understand why Kakashi Sensei and
the others are putting it that way.

1715
01:22:12,923 --> 01:22:16,927
But to me,
this is a serious mission.

1716
01:22:17,765 --> 01:22:20,810
It's our final mission as Team 8.

1717
01:22:21,724 --> 01:22:23,392
Team 8's final mission…

1718
01:22:24,058 --> 01:22:25,473
Once Hinata gets married,

1719
01:22:25,545 --> 01:22:29,549
we won't get to work together
like the way we used to, right?

1720
01:22:30,236 --> 01:22:31,013
Yes…

1721
01:22:32,552 --> 01:22:33,553
That's true…

1722
01:22:34,115 --> 01:22:37,076
And I have to get serious

1723
01:22:37,159 --> 01:22:39,704
if I intend on becoming
the next Hokage.

1724
01:22:40,521 --> 01:22:42,607
I can't keep relying on you.

1725
01:22:43,535 --> 01:22:45,555
Yeah, let's keep it that way.

1726
01:22:45,808 --> 01:22:48,394
What do you mean by that?!

1727
01:22:48,958 --> 01:22:49,687
Sorry.

1728
01:22:50,214 --> 01:22:55,261
In any case, this is for Hinata,
our last mission as Team 8…

1729
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:56,804
Right?

1730
01:22:57,263 --> 01:22:58,639
Right.

1731
01:22:59,377 --> 01:23:01,893
The question is…
what do we get them?

1732
01:23:02,226 --> 01:23:03,436
– Hmm…
– Hmm…

1733
01:23:04,697 --> 01:23:06,407
A gift for Hinata, huh?

1734
01:23:07,106 --> 01:23:10,026
It's gonna be from us
to Hinata and Naruto.

1735
01:23:10,051 --> 01:23:12,303
What would make them happy?

1736
01:23:12,908 --> 01:23:13,909
Akakiba!

1737
01:23:14,546 --> 01:23:16,295
Akakiba and Kibamaru!

1738
01:23:16,436 --> 01:23:20,048
You're mixing up the names…

1739
01:23:20,248 --> 01:23:21,994
Give me a break, Mirai…

1740
01:23:23,325 --> 01:23:26,523
Rather than hot tea, I feel like
relaxing with some shochu.

1741
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:28,461
Oh, that's right.

1742
01:23:28,604 --> 01:23:31,691
Speaking of alcohol,
have you heard about this story?

1743
01:23:33,311 --> 01:23:35,929
Back in the day,
the Senju Clan had a custom of

1744
01:23:35,999 --> 01:23:39,086
giving honey wine
as a wedding gift.

1745
01:23:40,328 --> 01:23:43,309
Long ago, the Senju Clan
who lived in the forest

1746
01:23:43,392 --> 01:23:45,519
discovered an unusual liquid
that was produced by chance

1747
01:23:45,667 --> 01:23:48,295
from rainwater
that collected in beehives.

1748
01:23:48,485 --> 01:23:50,570
And that was
the start of honey wine.

1749
01:23:51,524 --> 01:23:53,985
It was a nourishing, yet rare wine.

1750
01:23:54,173 --> 01:23:57,097
And since the olden days, it's been
served only during auspicious occasions.

1751
01:23:58,311 --> 01:24:01,955
Honey wine could be used as a
medicinal tonic as well as for cooking.

1752
01:24:02,995 --> 01:24:04,664
Hinata would find
some good uses for it.

1753
01:24:05,451 --> 01:24:07,142
She may appreciate
something like this!

1754
01:24:07,474 --> 01:24:11,315
And it conveys the wish
that Hinata and Naruto

1755
01:24:11,938 --> 01:24:13,422
spend their days in sweetness.

1756
01:24:13,447 --> 01:24:15,532
That's a cheesy joke.

1757
01:24:15,675 --> 01:24:17,510
Hinata wouldn't find it funny!

1758
01:24:21,717 --> 01:24:25,512
It's strange seeing you two
so lively without Hinata…

1759
01:24:26,394 --> 01:24:28,004
But I guess you'll get used to it.

1760
01:24:29,198 --> 01:24:32,763
Anyway, where do we find
this honey wine?

1761
01:24:33,151 --> 01:24:35,074
I heard there's a place
called Soraku.

1762
01:24:35,733 --> 01:24:39,278
And it seems the beekeeper
who lives there makes honey wine.

1763
01:24:40,123 --> 01:24:42,451
Finding people
is your specialty, right?

1764
01:24:43,109 --> 01:24:44,485
Okay, it's decided.

1765
01:24:45,192 --> 01:24:47,319
Let's go find this beekeeper.

1766
01:24:48,038 --> 01:24:50,749
Bye bye, Kibamaru! Akakiba!

1767
01:24:51,472 --> 01:24:53,433
It's Team 8's final mission!

1768
01:24:54,046 --> 01:24:55,224
Let's go, guys!

1769
01:24:56,465 --> 01:24:58,050
Our last mission, huh?

1770
01:25:05,275 --> 01:25:06,568
What a desolate place…

1771
01:25:06,809 --> 01:25:08,894
And it's pretty depressing too.

1772
01:25:09,395 --> 01:25:11,355
Sorry, it's so depressing, meow.

1773
01:25:15,693 --> 01:25:18,696
Judging from your headbands,
you're Hidden Leaf shinobi, meow?

1774
01:25:19,197 --> 01:25:22,540
You reek of dogs, you reek of bugs,
and you're a real dog.

1775
01:25:23,265 --> 01:25:25,810
Damn it, what a sorry bunch, meow.

1776
01:25:26,203 --> 01:25:27,455
A ninja cat?!

1777
01:25:27,788 --> 01:25:31,459
We're looking for a beekeeper
who lives in a place called Soraku.

1778
01:25:32,256 --> 01:25:33,394
We're not sketchy guys.

1779
01:25:33,419 --> 01:25:36,005
Meow, you're totally sketchy, meow!

1780
01:25:36,374 --> 01:25:38,937
I've got nothing to tell you, meow.

1781
01:25:39,341 --> 01:25:42,678
So that means you know where
this beekeeper is, right?

1782
01:25:43,119 --> 01:25:47,179
Okay, how about we catch it
and get the info out of it?

1783
01:25:48,032 --> 01:25:49,116
Let's do it, Akamaru!

1784
01:25:50,292 --> 01:25:52,961
Dumb humans, meow!

1785
01:25:53,064 --> 01:25:54,249
H-Hey!

1786
01:25:58,903 --> 01:26:00,112
<i>Insect Summoning Jutsu!</i>

1787
01:26:07,036 --> 01:26:08,037
Saved!

1788
01:26:08,508 --> 01:26:10,843
You're gonna mess around with us?!

1789
01:26:10,868 --> 01:26:11,994
Fine, then…

1790
01:26:12,875 --> 01:26:14,085
Tadah!

1791
01:26:14,256 --> 01:26:14,964
Here.

1792
01:26:15,556 --> 01:26:17,178
What is this?!

1793
01:26:17,505 --> 01:26:19,215
This is catnip.

1794
01:26:19,517 --> 01:26:22,095
It's very similar to silver vine.

1795
01:26:22,235 --> 01:26:23,444
Well?

1796
01:26:23,469 --> 01:26:25,262
Can't ignore it, can you?

1797
01:26:25,287 --> 01:26:26,955
Damn it…

1798
01:26:27,136 --> 01:26:28,641
My pride would never forgive me

1799
01:26:28,666 --> 01:26:31,127
if I got caught by someone
who reeks like a dog.

1800
01:26:32,285 --> 01:26:33,115
Hey!

1801
01:26:33,417 --> 01:26:36,754
Don't steal it!
You damn cat!

1802
01:26:37,858 --> 01:26:38,547
Momo!

1803
01:26:42,863 --> 01:26:44,238
Who are you guys?

1804
01:26:44,698 --> 01:26:46,084
How dare you chase after my Momo!

1805
01:26:46,697 --> 01:26:48,199
Must be that ninja cat's master.

1806
01:26:48,536 --> 01:26:50,496
Be careful, Kiba, Akamaru!

1807
01:26:51,055 --> 01:26:54,058
Oh…her name's Momo?

1808
01:26:55,016 --> 01:26:58,728
Fancy that…
My dog's name is Akamaru.

1809
01:26:59,097 --> 01:27:00,098
K-Kiba?

1810
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:06,011
By any chance,
was my cat rude to you?

1811
01:27:06,304 --> 01:27:07,179
I'm so sorry.

1812
01:27:07,263 --> 01:27:10,266
No, no...She's a cute ninja cat.

1813
01:27:11,188 --> 01:27:14,524
Just a minute ago,
you called me a "damn cat."

1814
01:27:15,166 --> 01:27:16,856
My name is Tamaki.

1815
01:27:17,203 --> 01:27:18,204
I'm Kiba…

1816
01:27:18,625 --> 01:27:20,960
This is my ninja hound, Akamaru.

1817
01:27:21,172 --> 01:27:22,659
You're a ninja hound user?!

1818
01:27:22,816 --> 01:27:23,710
Amazing!

1819
01:27:25,136 --> 01:27:28,159
Oh, it's nothing.

1820
01:27:28,331 --> 01:27:35,082
Although…I'm on the inside track
to become the next Hokage.

1821
01:27:35,215 --> 01:27:36,671
The next Lord Hokage?!

1822
01:27:36,921 --> 01:27:38,130
What's really amazing!

1823
01:27:38,155 --> 01:27:39,156
Nah…

1824
01:27:41,714 --> 01:27:44,383
But what is an important person
like you doing in a place like this?

1825
01:27:45,775 --> 01:27:46,444
Actually…

1826
01:27:46,469 --> 01:27:50,890
Actually…we're looking for
a beekeeper who lives in Soraku.

1827
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:53,726
Would you like me to guide you
part of the way?

1828
01:27:53,751 --> 01:27:54,934
You know him?

1829
01:27:54,959 --> 01:27:56,147
That would be great!

1830
01:27:56,627 --> 01:27:57,730
Right, Shino?

1831
01:28:05,978 --> 01:28:08,188
He lives in the bamboo grove
beyond here.

1832
01:28:08,903 --> 01:28:11,364
You probably
won't be able to find him.

1833
01:28:11,558 --> 01:28:13,685
Even cats get lost
in this grove, meow.

1834
01:28:14,027 --> 01:28:15,612
We're shinobi!

1835
01:28:15,789 --> 01:28:16,916
We won't get lost.

1836
01:28:17,624 --> 01:28:19,043
Well then, be careful.

1837
01:28:19,068 --> 01:28:20,570
Yeah! Thanks!

1838
01:28:35,083 --> 01:28:36,737
Yes, I know.

1839
01:28:40,833 --> 01:28:42,042
Intruders…

1840
01:28:44,443 --> 01:28:46,612
First, I'll track him with my nose.

1841
01:28:47,172 --> 01:28:49,392
And if I find him,
send in your insects.

1842
01:28:52,868 --> 01:28:55,359
That girl might be
talking about us.

1843
01:28:56,498 --> 01:28:57,499
Are you in love with her?

1844
01:28:57,895 --> 01:28:59,308
Huh?! Are you crazy?!

1845
01:28:59,333 --> 01:29:00,784
It's nothing like that!

1846
01:29:00,809 --> 01:29:03,437
This is a crucial time if I'm gonna
become the Hokage!

1847
01:29:03,462 --> 01:29:05,464
I have no time to fall in love!

1848
01:29:05,786 --> 01:29:07,405
You're easy to read.

1849
01:29:07,758 --> 01:29:09,593
Huh? What did you say?

1850
01:29:09,927 --> 01:29:12,554
Nothing. I just said I envy you.

1851
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:15,387
Huh? Really?

1852
01:29:17,827 --> 01:29:20,913
<i>And I have to get serious</i>

1853
01:29:20,938 --> 01:29:23,399
<i>if I intend to become
the next Hokage.</i>

1854
01:29:24,701 --> 01:29:30,140
<i>Kiba always talks big, and maybe
I viewed him with indifference…</i>

1855
01:29:31,512 --> 01:29:32,327
<i>However…</i>

1856
01:29:32,950 --> 01:29:36,078
<i>What's necessary
to realize a dream?</i>

1857
01:29:36,245 --> 01:29:39,123
<i>I want to take that first step
as soon as I can!</i>

1858
01:29:39,756 --> 01:29:42,467
<i>The first step in
realizing your dream…</i>

1859
01:29:43,538 --> 01:29:46,225
<i>Who am I to criticize anyone?</i>

1860
01:29:47,474 --> 01:29:48,725
<i>Once Hinata gets married,</i>

1861
01:29:48,882 --> 01:29:52,803
<i>we won't get to work together
like the way we used to, right?</i>

1862
01:29:53,798 --> 01:29:56,592
<i>"The way we used to," huh?</i>

1863
01:29:59,936 --> 01:30:00,937
Kiba!

1864
01:30:01,064 --> 01:30:02,524
Hey, Kiba!

1865
01:30:03,303 --> 01:30:04,304
Where are you?!

1866
01:30:12,614 --> 01:30:15,534
Really? You guys don't know either?

1867
01:30:16,094 --> 01:30:18,500
This is definitely someone's jutsu…

1868
01:30:23,042 --> 01:30:24,209
Yellow jackets?!

1869
01:30:29,173 --> 01:30:31,091
What is this jutsu?!

1870
01:30:38,955 --> 01:30:41,352
You belong to the Aburame Clan
of Hidden Leaf Village.

1871
01:30:42,227 --> 01:30:43,354
Correct.

1872
01:30:46,801 --> 01:30:49,304
You're skilled to be able to
deceive me…

1873
01:30:49,876 --> 01:30:51,086
But how?

1874
01:30:51,111 --> 01:30:52,279
The poison should have…

1875
01:30:52,542 --> 01:30:53,709
The poison got me…

1876
01:30:54,097 --> 01:30:55,140
But it's not a problem.

1877
01:30:55,607 --> 01:30:58,869
It's because this amount of poison
won't kill me.

1878
01:30:59,578 --> 01:31:03,540
Well now, it's my loss.
It can't be helped.

1879
01:31:04,333 --> 01:31:08,170
I'm proud to die by the hand of
an Insect User of your caliber.

1880
01:31:08,253 --> 01:31:09,505
No, hold on.

1881
01:31:10,214 --> 01:31:12,174
I don't want your life.

1882
01:31:13,050 --> 01:31:14,093
I want your honey wine.

1883
01:31:20,931 --> 01:31:22,599
Thank you, how much do I owe you?

1884
01:31:23,310 --> 01:31:24,311
I don't want money.

1885
01:31:24,592 --> 01:31:26,594
You can take it. It means nothing.

1886
01:31:27,436 --> 01:31:28,136
I see…

1887
01:31:28,683 --> 01:31:32,194
Now, if you can tell me
the road back, I'd be grateful.

1888
01:31:33,406 --> 01:31:34,741
There is no road.

1889
01:31:36,429 --> 01:31:37,430
What do you mean?

1890
01:31:37,852 --> 01:31:39,118
Exactly what I said.

1891
01:31:40,411 --> 01:31:44,081
This bamboo grove is surrounded by
something like a barrier.

1892
01:31:44,437 --> 01:31:46,481
Once you step inside,
there's no way out.

1893
01:31:46,757 --> 01:31:50,504
You'll continue to wander through
an endless fog…that is all…

1894
01:31:51,051 --> 01:31:53,429
That's the kind of jutsu this is.

1895
01:31:54,258 --> 01:31:55,259
What?!

1896
01:32:01,509 --> 01:32:03,636
<i>I'm sorry to tell you that
this jutsu cannot be broken.</i>

1897
01:32:03,934 --> 01:32:06,353
<i>Even if you kill me…</i>

1898
01:32:07,813 --> 01:32:08,981
What do you mean?!

1899
01:32:09,516 --> 01:32:11,226
<i>Originally, this mist contained</i>

1900
01:32:11,324 --> 01:32:14,411
<i>a special component
meant to lead people astray.</i>

1901
01:32:14,695 --> 01:32:19,491
<i>I incorporated a little of it
into my jutsu formula…</i>

1902
01:32:22,005 --> 01:32:24,674
But that can't be why
you can't break the jutsu?

1903
01:32:25,267 --> 01:32:26,102
<i>No…</i>

1904
01:32:26,598 --> 01:32:29,685
<i>But, the nasty thing
about this jutsu is…</i>

1905
01:32:29,710 --> 01:32:32,421
<i>…that it takes the doubt inside of
its victims and turns it into fog,</i>

1906
01:32:32,504 --> 01:32:34,423
<i>making it thicker and thicker…</i>

1907
01:32:35,007 --> 01:32:36,008
What?!

1908
01:32:36,175 --> 01:32:37,342
<i>Haven't you noticed?</i>

1909
01:32:38,010 --> 01:32:40,554
<i>This bamboo grove
makes people lose their way…</i>

1910
01:32:40,654 --> 01:32:42,489
<i>and when the jutsu is used,</i>

1911
01:32:42,514 --> 01:32:45,309
<i>a thicker fog
confuses them even more.</i>

1912
01:32:46,143 --> 01:32:47,478
<i>In other words,</i>

1913
01:32:47,503 --> 01:32:51,340
<i>this jutsu has no effect on someone
who has no doubts.</i>

1914
01:32:52,420 --> 01:32:55,047
So…you're saying I have doubts?

1915
01:32:55,635 --> 01:32:58,513
<i>Yeah! I'm gonna reach my dream,
just like you!</i>

1916
01:32:58,739 --> 01:33:00,199
<i>Once Hinata gets married,</i>

1917
01:33:00,282 --> 01:33:04,328
<i>we won't be working together
the way we used to, right?</i>

1918
01:33:04,870 --> 01:33:09,082
<i>It's strange seeing you two
so lively without Hinata…</i>

1919
01:33:09,583 --> 01:33:11,543
<i>But I guess you'll get used to it.</i>

1920
01:33:12,430 --> 01:33:13,848
I understand…

1921
01:33:20,201 --> 01:33:23,663
I've been questioning
how to live as a shinobi

1922
01:33:23,764 --> 01:33:27,768
after Team 8 disbands
when Hinata gets married.

1923
01:33:29,311 --> 01:33:33,482
To be together always,
with my friends in Team 8.

1924
01:33:34,532 --> 01:33:35,880
That was my dream.

1925
01:33:38,348 --> 01:33:39,161
I see…

1926
01:33:39,702 --> 01:33:41,323
I was doubting myself…

1927
01:33:42,991 --> 01:33:45,327
You and I are alike.

1928
01:33:45,494 --> 01:33:48,664
I'm still lost
on this path called life.

1929
01:33:49,414 --> 01:33:50,874
So, how about it?

1930
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:53,502
There is doubt,
but there is no suffering here.

1931
01:33:53,752 --> 01:33:56,004
I am finally living life now!

1932
01:33:57,468 --> 01:33:59,929
Your friends understand too!

1933
01:34:00,133 --> 01:34:02,052
It's okay to have doubts…

1934
01:34:02,302 --> 01:34:04,680
It's not your fault
that you have doubts…

1935
01:34:07,933 --> 01:34:10,143
Kiba...Hinata…

1936
01:34:10,871 --> 01:34:13,249
It's not necessary to move forward.

1937
01:34:13,397 --> 01:34:17,067
Abandon it all, and stay here
with your doubts.

1938
01:34:17,614 --> 01:34:20,916
If you agree, stay with us…

1939
01:34:21,182 --> 01:34:23,643
<i>C'mon, Shino…</i>

1940
01:34:29,876 --> 01:34:31,919
<i>It's Team 8's final mission!</i>

1941
01:34:32,541 --> 01:34:34,001
<i>Let's go, guys!</i>

1942
01:34:36,389 --> 01:34:37,111
No…

1943
01:34:38,375 --> 01:34:41,462
That's not what…I'm looking for…

1944
01:34:41,962 --> 01:34:42,705
What?

1945
01:34:44,344 --> 01:34:45,944
What I'm looking for is…

1946
01:34:47,406 --> 01:34:48,758
What I'm looking for…

1947
01:34:49,365 --> 01:34:51,718
…is to be with my friend
who keeps moving forward.

1948
01:34:53,021 --> 01:34:55,147
Not someone who stays
in the same place with me!

1949
01:34:56,814 --> 01:34:59,860
I can't be stuck here like this.

1950
01:35:00,914 --> 01:35:03,208
I have to return to the village
right away.

1951
01:35:04,484 --> 01:35:09,364
It's because…I have to attend
an important friend's wedding.

1952
01:35:10,370 --> 01:35:12,789
You think you can find
your way out of this fog?

1953
01:35:13,236 --> 01:35:15,655
When you're in so much doubt
about your life?!

1954
01:35:16,668 --> 01:35:17,669
Yeah.

1955
01:35:18,295 --> 01:35:21,298
To make sure he can walk
his path without worry,

1956
01:35:21,757 --> 01:35:24,384
I'm definitely gonna
find my path in life.

1957
01:35:25,056 --> 01:35:27,183
And I have no doubt about that!

1958
01:35:35,468 --> 01:35:36,469
An entrance…

1959
01:35:37,283 --> 01:35:39,577
No, it's the exit.

1960
01:35:44,537 --> 01:35:47,483
<i>So, you were able to see the path
beyond the guardian deity of travelers.</i>

1961
01:35:48,659 --> 01:35:51,453
<i>I see...Then go quickly.</i>

1962
01:35:51,566 --> 01:35:53,651
<i>Before you lose the path.</i>

1963
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:57,323
Wait...You just said
you're living life now.

1964
01:35:58,168 --> 01:35:59,795
But is that really true?

1965
01:36:01,004 --> 01:36:01,963
<i>What?</i>

1966
01:36:02,499 --> 01:36:04,209
Someone who remains
stuck in the past,

1967
01:36:04,234 --> 01:36:06,319
and cannot see the future…

1968
01:36:06,750 --> 01:36:09,258
Is that really living?

1969
01:36:10,366 --> 01:36:14,271
I know people
who live every moment,

1970
01:36:14,365 --> 01:36:16,909
striving as hard as they could to
reach a goal that seems so far…

1971
01:36:17,729 --> 01:36:20,232
They're the ones
who are really living life.

1972
01:36:20,941 --> 01:36:21,942
That's my belief…

1973
01:36:22,734 --> 01:36:24,027
<i>I'm shocked.</i>

1974
01:36:24,408 --> 01:36:26,535
<i>You're nothing like the quiet man
I thought you were…</i>

1975
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:29,491
<i>You are very passionate
on the inside.</i>

1976
01:36:29,783 --> 01:36:31,868
<i>I feel like I'm being lectured
by my teacher.</i>

1977
01:36:32,744 --> 01:36:33,704
What are you saying?

1978
01:36:34,471 --> 01:36:35,555
<i>Now go.</i>

1979
01:36:35,580 --> 01:36:38,500
<i>In time, I will be like you…</i>

1980
01:36:45,382 --> 01:36:47,384
Where have you been?!

1981
01:36:47,498 --> 01:36:49,000
You disappeared suddenly!

1982
01:36:50,111 --> 01:36:50,987
Sorry.

1983
01:36:51,509 --> 01:36:53,427
However, I got a hold of this.

1984
01:36:53,746 --> 01:36:55,998
Whoa! When did you—!

1985
01:36:56,374 --> 01:36:58,626
I was sure you were lost.

1986
01:36:59,104 --> 01:37:00,522
Yeah, I was lost.

1987
01:37:01,596 --> 01:37:02,797
But I've found my way.

1988
01:37:03,777 --> 01:37:04,459
It's because…

1989
01:37:04,484 --> 01:37:07,738
Anyway, let's take this home,
Akamaru!

1990
01:37:09,865 --> 01:37:11,575
What about that girl?

1991
01:37:11,992 --> 01:37:12,743
Huh?!

1992
01:37:12,923 --> 01:37:15,593
Why are you bringing
that up again?!

1993
01:37:15,715 --> 01:37:16,507
Sorry.

1994
01:37:16,663 --> 01:37:17,664
Damn it.

1995
01:37:18,248 --> 01:37:20,459
Maybe I'll write her.

1996
01:37:21,001 --> 01:37:23,128
Letters? How unlike you.

1997
01:37:23,211 --> 01:37:24,713
Huh? Why?!

1998
01:37:24,854 --> 01:37:27,638
There's nothing wrong with letters.
Right, Akamaru?!

1999
01:37:29,225 --> 01:37:31,144
Akamaru, not you too?!

2000
01:37:31,895 --> 01:37:34,506
Yikes! Bugs again!

2001
01:37:35,182 --> 01:37:36,892
It's so amazing!

2002
01:37:36,991 --> 01:37:39,619
Maybe I'll make my goal to
become an Insect User too.

2003
01:37:39,828 --> 01:37:40,495
Yeah…

2004
01:37:40,659 --> 01:37:44,413
I'd better get started too,
or I won't become the Hokage.

2005
01:37:44,859 --> 01:37:45,933
You're wrong, kid.

2006
01:37:46,648 --> 01:37:48,524
You've already taken that step.

2007
01:37:48,549 --> 01:37:49,287
Huh?

2008
01:37:49,675 --> 01:37:50,676
It's because…

2009
01:37:54,159 --> 01:37:55,744
Putting your goal into words…

2010
01:37:55,911 --> 01:37:58,663
…is the first step towards
realizing one's dream.

2011
01:37:59,331 --> 01:38:00,373
I got it!

2012
01:38:00,398 --> 01:38:01,983
Thanks, Big Bro!

2013
01:38:02,250 --> 01:38:03,293
Let's go!

2014
01:38:03,418 --> 01:38:05,337
Tsukune, come on!

2015
01:38:05,420 --> 01:38:06,114
Yeah!

2016
01:38:10,258 --> 01:38:11,259
Iruka Sensei…

2017
01:38:11,564 --> 01:38:14,567
You completely won over
those bad kids.

2018
01:38:14,614 --> 01:38:16,491
Maybe you should become a teacher.

2019
01:38:17,256 --> 01:38:18,092
A teacher?!

2020
01:38:19,309 --> 01:38:21,269
It's difficult even for us
to keep up with

2021
01:38:21,294 --> 01:38:23,921
mischievous kids like that
year after year.

2022
01:38:24,272 --> 01:38:25,857
You're quite impressive.

2023
01:38:26,429 --> 01:38:28,765
It's not that difficult for me.

2024
01:38:29,361 --> 01:38:30,362
It's because…

2025
01:38:31,404 --> 01:38:32,614
I've always been around…

2026
01:38:33,990 --> 01:38:36,284
…the bad kids…

2027
01:38:40,929 --> 01:38:42,624
Hmm…

2028
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:44,061
What a dilemma…

2029
01:38:44,234 --> 01:38:45,902
What's the matter, Lord Kakashi?

2030
01:38:46,366 --> 01:38:48,117
Please, drop the "lord"!

2031
01:38:48,499 --> 01:38:50,960
Anyway, remember the mission
I assigned everyone?

2032
01:38:51,727 --> 01:38:54,361
Do I really have to
assess each thing?

2033
01:38:54,430 --> 01:38:55,561
Of course!

2034
01:38:56,983 --> 01:38:57,984
Oink oink.

2035
01:38:58,682 --> 01:39:00,552
The honey wine's really great,

2036
01:39:00,700 --> 01:39:02,702
it's perfect for
a special occasion.

2037
01:39:02,946 --> 01:39:05,949
You can tell Team 8
went all out for this.

2038
01:39:05,981 --> 01:39:07,357
And these gift certificates
for a dinner

2039
01:39:07,357 --> 01:39:10,402
and the hot springs vacation
is very thoughtful!

2040
01:39:10,529 --> 01:39:12,612
I wasn't expecting this
from Choji and Shikamaru.

2041
01:39:12,612 --> 01:39:14,114
They outdid themselves.

2042
01:39:14,409 --> 01:39:15,715
You can really see
the girls' personal tastes

2043
01:39:15,740 --> 01:39:17,367
reflected in their choices.

2044
01:39:17,968 --> 01:39:21,204
That's just cute…
but take a look at this.

2045
01:39:26,596 --> 01:39:28,056
It's unbelievable, right?

2046
01:39:28,670 --> 01:39:32,382
Oh, and Konohamaru hasn't even
turned in a report.

2047
01:39:33,185 --> 01:39:35,979
I-It turned out well, though.

2048
01:39:36,221 --> 01:39:39,698
Now they can be the ones on duty
on the day of the reception.

2049
01:39:40,013 --> 01:39:42,605
True, if I'm to assess the gifts
and make my selections,

2050
01:39:42,630 --> 01:39:45,425
these three should be
the candidates.

2051
01:39:46,220 --> 01:39:48,356
But it this really all right?

2052
01:39:55,071 --> 01:39:56,072
Kakashi Sensei?

2053
01:40:00,410 --> 01:40:03,705
Oh?!
Hinata! It's been awhile!

2054
01:40:03,904 --> 01:40:05,280
What's up?

2055
01:40:05,790 --> 01:40:08,376
I'm meeting up with Sakura
and the girls. It's been so long.

2056
01:40:09,014 --> 01:40:11,225
Your last ladies' get-together
as a single woman, huh?

2057
01:40:12,144 --> 01:40:13,812
How are your wedding plans going?

2058
01:40:14,517 --> 01:40:15,935
I take it Naruto's doing okay?

2059
01:40:16,426 --> 01:40:18,345
Huh? Oh, yes.

2060
01:40:19,326 --> 01:40:20,536
He's doing really well!

2061
01:40:21,538 --> 01:40:23,040
Where are you headed,
Kakashi Sensei?

2062
01:40:24,156 --> 01:40:25,783
I'm going to take a quick nap.

2063
01:40:26,180 --> 01:40:28,476
Oh...I'm sorry to have bothered you.

2064
01:40:29,195 --> 01:40:30,732
Please excuse me!

2065
01:40:30,981 --> 01:40:32,046
Oh…

2066
01:40:43,789 --> 01:40:45,252
Hmm…

2067
01:40:45,978 --> 01:40:47,666
What's the matter, Iruka Sensei?

2068
01:40:48,172 --> 01:40:49,834
Was the ramen bad?

2069
01:40:50,126 --> 01:40:53,213
No, no!
The ramen was delicious!

2070
01:40:53,630 --> 01:40:54,756
It's not that…

2071
01:40:54,781 --> 01:40:57,404
I knew you'd be here, Iruka Sensei!

2072
01:40:57,857 --> 01:40:59,752
K-Konohamaru!

2073
01:40:59,777 --> 01:41:00,695
This has gone on too long.

2074
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:02,889
I really need to get
your congratulatory message!

2075
01:41:03,139 --> 01:41:06,476
Otherwise, I can't turn in
this video as my wedding gift!

2076
01:41:06,726 --> 01:41:07,811
I'm so sorry!

2077
01:41:08,019 --> 01:41:10,730
So, is that what
you're agonizing about?

2078
01:41:11,015 --> 01:41:13,400
Yes, I can't think of what to say.

2079
01:41:13,483 --> 01:41:15,652
Well, you're agonizing too much!

2080
01:41:15,735 --> 01:41:17,946
Get ready,
I'm gonna record you now!

2081
01:41:18,071 --> 01:41:19,114
H-Hey, wait!

2082
01:41:21,241 --> 01:41:23,535
Get it together, Iruka Sensei!

2083
01:41:25,816 --> 01:41:28,110
Konohamaru's right, Iruka Sensei.

2084
01:41:28,786 --> 01:41:31,751
How can anyone not know what to
say in a congratulatory message?

2085
01:41:32,037 --> 01:41:33,642
You're Naruto's teacher,
aren't you?!

2086
01:41:34,462 --> 01:41:36,047
That's the reason why!

2087
01:41:41,803 --> 01:41:42,966
– That's the reason?
– That's the reason?

2088
01:41:43,450 --> 01:41:46,120
Back when Lord Kazekage
came to Ichiraku…

2089
01:41:47,829 --> 01:41:50,036
<i>I'm going to honor Naruto
not as the Kazekage,</i>

2090
01:41:50,061 --> 01:41:52,605
<i>but as his friend.</i>

2091
01:41:53,732 --> 01:41:55,066
When I heard that,

2092
01:41:55,191 --> 01:42:00,155
I began to wonder in what role
should I celebrate him?

2093
01:42:01,281 --> 01:42:02,490
What do you mean?

2094
01:42:03,450 --> 01:42:05,577
What else? You're his teacher.

2095
01:42:07,326 --> 01:42:11,448
Without a doubt, you may all
see me as his "teacher."

2096
01:42:11,499 --> 01:42:13,626
That's right! So, hurry up
and let me record you,

2097
01:42:13,626 --> 01:42:15,462
or I can't finish it!

2098
01:42:15,545 --> 01:42:16,312
Yeah…

2099
01:42:17,571 --> 01:42:20,341
But I kind of feel like
it shouldn't be coming from

2100
01:42:20,366 --> 01:42:22,743
the point of view of
a teacher to his pupil.

2101
01:42:24,135 --> 01:42:26,556
I don't even know if it's right
to do this as his teacher, or not…

2102
01:42:26,913 --> 01:42:29,893
But I feel Naruto's a little
different than my other students.

2103
01:42:30,477 --> 01:42:35,440
And that's why I can't proceed
as a teacher.

2104
01:42:35,916 --> 01:42:38,188
And yet, I don't think
you can call us "friends"

2105
01:42:38,213 --> 01:42:40,735
in the way Lord Kakashi described.

2106
01:42:42,172 --> 01:42:45,184
Anyway, the more I think about it,

2107
01:42:45,450 --> 01:42:48,286
the more unsure I become
about my message for Naruto.

2108
01:42:49,819 --> 01:42:51,738
That's for sure…

2109
01:42:51,763 --> 01:42:54,892
You and Naruto being friends
doesn't feel quite right.

2110
01:42:55,543 --> 01:42:59,756
Anyways, I'm gonna charge you
for that bowl…

2111
01:43:02,092 --> 01:43:03,176
And? And?

2112
01:43:03,706 --> 01:43:05,750
Are all the preparations for
the reception finished?

2113
01:43:06,471 --> 01:43:08,556
Yes, most of it.

2114
01:43:09,266 --> 01:43:10,475
Anyways,

2115
01:43:10,593 --> 01:43:13,169
I'm so surprised the first one
out of our group to get married

2116
01:43:13,194 --> 01:43:14,862
are you and Naruto!

2117
01:43:15,129 --> 01:43:17,089
How is Naruto lately?

2118
01:43:17,332 --> 01:43:19,751
Is he helping you at all?

2119
01:43:20,321 --> 01:43:21,322
Of course!

2120
01:43:21,544 --> 01:43:26,320
More than Naruto, it's my father
who keeps telling me what I should do.

2121
01:43:26,894 --> 01:43:30,662
It's true about the father
of the bride being a pain.

2122
01:43:30,870 --> 01:43:33,873
I guess planning a wedding
is a huge task.

2123
01:43:34,006 --> 01:43:35,382
Of course it is!

2124
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:37,685
Even with us…
Kakashi Sensei gave us that…

2125
01:43:37,710 --> 01:43:39,170
Ah!

2126
01:43:39,420 --> 01:43:40,630
Hey, Sakura!

2127
01:43:41,144 --> 01:43:42,228
What's the big idea—!

2128
01:43:44,676 --> 01:43:47,595
<i>Even with us, Kakashi Sensei
gave us that mission…</i>

2129
01:43:47,620 --> 01:43:48,580
<i>Damn it!</i>

2130
01:43:48,721 --> 01:43:50,056
– Oh!
– Oh!

2131
01:43:50,431 --> 01:43:52,142
– Ah! Ah!
– Ah! Ah!

2132
01:43:57,836 --> 01:43:59,816
What about Kakashi Sensei?

2133
01:43:59,916 --> 01:44:00,571
– Huh?!
– Huh?!

2134
01:44:01,776 --> 01:44:03,153
– Er…um…
– Er…um…

2135
01:44:03,496 --> 01:44:04,738
He's going through a lot trying to
wrap up all the missions

2136
01:44:04,763 --> 01:44:05,764
before the wedding.

2137
01:44:05,789 --> 01:44:07,082
That's all.

2138
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:08,241
Yeah!

2139
01:44:08,324 --> 01:44:12,704
And unlike us, you already
have Naruto, so you're lucky.

2140
01:44:12,787 --> 01:44:14,455
That's all.
Yeah, that's right!

2141
01:44:16,107 --> 01:44:17,792
Well, I guess so.

2142
01:44:17,988 --> 01:44:21,171
So? So?
Are you going to wear a kimono?

2143
01:44:21,212 --> 01:44:23,882
You're gonna look so pretty
as a bride!

2144
01:44:23,931 --> 01:44:25,683
Yeah, yeah!

2145
01:44:26,185 --> 01:44:27,927
Hey, Hinata!

2146
01:44:32,432 --> 01:44:33,641
Long time no see!

2147
01:44:35,020 --> 01:44:36,811
Kiba, Shino!

2148
01:44:37,348 --> 01:44:38,396
Have you been doing all right?

2149
01:44:38,591 --> 01:44:40,843
Yeah! You two seem great as well!

2150
01:44:41,107 --> 01:44:44,611
Of course, since we'll soon be
celebrating your wedding soon.

2151
01:44:45,194 --> 01:44:46,337
It's because…

2152
01:44:46,362 --> 01:44:50,742
How's Naruto doing?!
We rarely see him these days.

2153
01:44:50,875 --> 01:44:54,503
I guess he's busy getting ready
for the big day.

2154
01:44:55,121 --> 01:44:55,955
Yes.

2155
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:58,374
Naruto's busy with his missions,

2156
01:44:58,452 --> 01:45:00,413
but he's been helping a lot
with the reception.

2157
01:45:00,475 --> 01:45:01,393
He's really dependable.

2158
01:45:01,544 --> 01:45:02,545
Oh, yeah?

2159
01:45:02,587 --> 01:45:04,664
Well, we're completing
a huge mission

2160
01:45:04,689 --> 01:45:06,399
and we're gonna make you happy…

2161
01:45:06,424 --> 01:45:07,175
Kiba!

2162
01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:07,962
Huh?

2163
01:45:08,593 --> 01:45:09,361
Oh!

2164
01:45:11,596 --> 01:45:13,681
Make me what?

2165
01:45:14,607 --> 01:45:15,357
Anyways…

2166
01:45:15,433 --> 01:45:20,730
What he means is you and Naruto
will definitely make a happy home!

2167
01:45:20,772 --> 01:45:22,774
We're looking forward
to the reception!

2168
01:45:23,103 --> 01:45:24,901
Oh, thank you.

2169
01:45:46,555 --> 01:45:47,503
Lady Tsunade!

2170
01:45:50,635 --> 01:45:54,264
It's been a while, Shizune!
How have you been?

2171
01:45:54,764 --> 01:45:55,807
Great, thank you!

2172
01:45:56,516 --> 01:45:58,935
How has your wagering
been going lately?

2173
01:45:59,436 --> 01:46:01,730
There's Naruto and Hinata's
upcoming wedding,

2174
01:46:01,956 --> 01:46:03,226
so I'm not spending excessively.

2175
01:46:03,251 --> 01:46:05,336
That is a wise decision.

2176
01:46:06,437 --> 01:46:08,785
Anyway, what did you
want to discuss?

2177
01:46:09,404 --> 01:46:12,115
Yes…
Actually, it's about Lord Kakashi…

2178
01:46:12,861 --> 01:46:16,661
Kakashi?
What's the matter with Lord Sixth?

2179
01:46:18,168 --> 01:46:19,798
<i>I have no choice…</i>

2180
01:46:20,223 --> 01:46:22,642
<i>I don't have footage
of Iruka Sensei,</i>

2181
01:46:22,793 --> 01:46:26,296
<i>but I'll report this as
my wedding gift for the time being.</i>

2182
01:46:26,321 --> 01:46:27,828
Wedding gift items?!

2183
01:46:28,150 --> 01:46:31,217
Yes, in addition to shinobi
gathering for the reception,

2184
01:46:31,401 --> 01:46:34,116
there's the standing rule to assess
the gifts everyone will be presenting

2185
01:46:34,141 --> 01:46:37,456
in order to determine who will
be attending the wedding, correct?

2186
01:46:37,765 --> 01:46:38,850
I remember that rule…

2187
01:46:39,910 --> 01:46:44,377
Lord Kakashi has been
in a dilemma about

2188
01:46:44,772 --> 01:46:48,226
how he will judge and
who he will eliminate.

2189
01:46:51,433 --> 01:46:52,613
<i>When you think about it,</i>

2190
01:46:52,697 --> 01:46:55,867
<i>having anyone
not being able to attend,</i>

2191
01:46:56,056 --> 01:46:58,600
<i>will make Naruto and Hinata
very sad.</i>

2192
01:46:59,620 --> 01:47:03,865
And yet, someone still has to go on
missions and be on guard that day.

2193
01:47:03,916 --> 01:47:06,334
He's worrying about that?!

2194
01:47:06,610 --> 01:47:07,653
Damn it.

2195
01:47:08,541 --> 01:47:10,089
<i>This is really bad!</i>

2196
01:47:21,700 --> 01:47:24,370
Everyone's acting a little weird.

2197
01:47:24,422 --> 01:47:26,800
Hey! I'm not lying!

2198
01:47:27,128 --> 01:47:31,071
Our gifts will be judged to determine
who can attend the reception?

2199
01:47:31,549 --> 01:47:32,888
What's the meaning of this?

2200
01:47:33,038 --> 01:47:35,249
I don't get it at all!

2201
01:47:35,286 --> 01:47:38,998
Please stop!
I'm not to blame for this!

2202
01:47:40,989 --> 01:47:42,073
This is the worst!

2203
01:47:42,758 --> 01:47:44,933
Well…it's like this…

2204
01:47:46,793 --> 01:47:48,669
Most shinobi of the village

2205
01:47:48,768 --> 01:47:51,813
will attend
Naruto and Hinata's reception.

2206
01:47:52,507 --> 01:47:56,611
That said, it doesn't mean that
we won't have missions on that day.

2207
01:47:56,636 --> 01:47:58,099
We'll need people on duty.

2208
01:47:59,105 --> 01:48:01,286
Plus, we'll have important guests.

2209
01:48:02,043 --> 01:48:05,052
And it'll be crucial to have
sufficient security for the reception.

2210
01:48:05,517 --> 01:48:06,518
That's right.

2211
01:48:06,543 --> 01:48:11,757
Many of Naruto and Hinata's friends
are top-ranked jonin.

2212
01:48:12,040 --> 01:48:13,041
So, what does that mean?

2213
01:48:13,258 --> 01:48:18,180
We'll have to draw lots to see
who can attend the wedding?!

2214
01:48:18,324 --> 01:48:19,243
No way!

2215
01:48:19,268 --> 01:48:21,985
If that's the case, we won't be able
to truly celebrate with the couple!

2216
01:48:22,976 --> 01:48:26,495
<i>I didn't think our wedding would
cause so much trouble…</i>

2217
01:48:27,284 --> 01:48:30,245
It seems this is troubling
Kakashi Sensei as well.

2218
01:48:30,724 --> 01:48:31,786
I see how it would.

2219
01:48:31,811 --> 01:48:34,522
Why did it turn into
such a big affair?

2220
01:48:34,715 --> 01:48:38,594
Naruto's someone who connects
the entire village.

2221
01:48:38,965 --> 01:48:40,001
So, I guess it would
turn into a big deal.

2222
01:48:40,026 --> 01:48:42,069
So, we just sit and wait
until the final judgement?

2223
01:48:42,390 --> 01:48:43,891
There's no need for that.

2224
01:48:44,475 --> 01:48:47,019
I'll do the dirty work,
and that'll be that.

2225
01:48:47,186 --> 01:48:50,231
Yes! I want everyone
to attend the reception, so…

2226
01:48:50,286 --> 01:48:52,037
I'll volunteer for duty!

2227
01:48:52,191 --> 01:48:54,861
That's right! I'll do it too!

2228
01:48:54,981 --> 01:48:56,821
Fine, I'll sign me up too.

2229
01:48:56,821 --> 01:48:58,030
That's not right!

2230
01:48:58,206 --> 01:49:01,292
If Team 8 isn't there,
Hinata will be sad.

2231
01:49:01,534 --> 01:49:05,580
But, I'm not okay with someone
missing the reception

2232
01:49:05,660 --> 01:49:06,870
just so we can.

2233
01:49:07,167 --> 01:49:08,877
We feel the same way.

2234
01:49:23,514 --> 01:49:26,726
Now then,
sleeping won't solve anything.

2235
01:49:30,605 --> 01:49:31,606
Kakashi Sensei!

2236
01:49:35,902 --> 01:49:36,903
Kakashi Sensei!

2237
01:49:37,461 --> 01:49:38,462
I'm so sorry!

2238
01:49:38,905 --> 01:49:39,525
Huh?

2239
01:49:40,118 --> 01:49:40,745
What?

2240
01:49:41,496 --> 01:49:42,914
W-What's wrong, Hinata?

2241
01:49:43,535 --> 01:49:44,314
What happened?

2242
01:49:44,962 --> 01:49:45,812
I just heard…

2243
01:49:46,287 --> 01:49:50,082
The dilemma you're going through,
all because our wedding reception.

2244
01:49:50,333 --> 01:49:52,752
Huh? What?
What's this about?

2245
01:49:53,336 --> 01:49:55,817
You haven't decided
who can attend on that day, right?

2246
01:49:56,172 --> 01:49:58,298
What? You heard?

2247
01:49:58,758 --> 01:49:59,339
Yes!

2248
01:49:59,672 --> 01:50:00,673
About the mission too?

2249
01:50:00,968 --> 01:50:01,552
Yes.

2250
01:50:01,742 --> 01:50:02,743
Everything?

2251
01:50:02,858 --> 01:50:03,510
Yes.

2252
01:50:04,388 --> 01:50:06,432
I see…

2253
01:50:07,138 --> 01:50:09,766
We would never want to
put anyone through any trouble,

2254
01:50:09,958 --> 01:50:11,875
just to celebrate our wedding day.

2255
01:50:13,272 --> 01:50:15,358
No, no, no, no!

2256
01:50:15,584 --> 01:50:19,088
We have to have a reception
for you two!

2257
01:50:19,491 --> 01:50:20,659
Then is it possible, at least…

2258
01:50:20,905 --> 01:50:23,777
…to have the Hyuga Clan fulfill
the missions and guard duty

2259
01:50:23,882 --> 01:50:25,508
for that day?

2260
01:50:27,088 --> 01:50:28,513
There's no need for that!

2261
01:50:28,538 --> 01:50:29,539
Huh?!

2262
01:50:29,664 --> 01:50:31,999
The day of your wedding
is a happy day

2263
01:50:32,083 --> 01:50:34,252
for your clan too, right?

2264
01:50:35,603 --> 01:50:37,563
It's my duty as the Hokage
to make sure

2265
01:50:37,588 --> 01:50:40,925
every member of your family
is there for you.

2266
01:50:41,634 --> 01:50:43,219
I…see.

2267
01:50:43,636 --> 01:50:45,638
I'll do something about
duty assignments.

2268
01:50:46,852 --> 01:50:48,854
So don't worry about anything.

2269
01:50:50,269 --> 01:50:50,893
All right.

2270
01:50:51,205 --> 01:50:54,375
Focus on yourselves, that's all.

2271
01:50:56,368 --> 01:50:57,953
Oops, I'd better get back!

2272
01:50:58,546 --> 01:50:59,355
See you!

2273
01:51:02,433 --> 01:51:04,018
What?!
What's going on, you guys?

2274
01:51:06,158 --> 01:51:07,243
We heard.

2275
01:51:07,419 --> 01:51:08,879
About Naruto and Hinata's
reception…

2276
01:51:09,285 --> 01:51:10,911
And that some of us
won't be able to attend.

2277
01:51:11,038 --> 01:51:15,485
And the mission to find the wedding
gifts was in order to assess them.

2278
01:51:16,002 --> 01:51:19,046
I see...So, you all found out too.

2279
01:51:19,462 --> 01:51:21,505
And also, that you've been
agonizing over this.

2280
01:51:21,993 --> 01:51:23,991
It's my job as the Hokage.

2281
01:51:24,471 --> 01:51:25,555
And what about it?

2282
01:51:25,986 --> 01:51:27,697
You're here to oppose?

2283
01:51:28,025 --> 01:51:29,777
No, actually the opposite!

2284
01:51:30,134 --> 01:51:30,759
What?

2285
01:51:31,142 --> 01:51:33,728
Everyone here will handle
the assignments.

2286
01:51:33,894 --> 01:51:35,473
But if you do that,

2287
01:51:35,498 --> 01:51:37,917
Naruto and Hinata
are sure to be sad.

2288
01:51:38,410 --> 01:51:41,205
That's why we're all going to
the wedding reception.

2289
01:51:42,171 --> 01:51:43,172
What do you mean?

2290
01:51:43,915 --> 01:51:46,995
Simply put, we'll make a schedule
of assignments and guard duty,

2291
01:51:47,184 --> 01:51:48,435
and work in shifts.

2292
01:51:48,909 --> 01:51:53,205
If everyone puts in some time,
everyone can wish them well!

2293
01:51:53,414 --> 01:51:57,209
Helping each other out
is something Naruto taught us.

2294
01:51:59,128 --> 01:51:59,837
Well?

2295
01:51:59,962 --> 01:52:02,256
This way, you won't have to bear the
all the burden, right Kakashi Sensei?

2296
01:52:02,902 --> 01:52:03,799
You guys…

2297
01:52:04,925 --> 01:52:05,926
Thank you!

2298
01:52:06,177 --> 01:52:09,013
But if we do this,
we'll have to change the rule.

2299
01:52:09,114 --> 01:52:10,157
Don't worry.

2300
01:52:10,393 --> 01:52:13,104
Through hell or high water,
I'll think of something.

2301
01:52:13,556 --> 01:52:14,557
You'll drown…

2302
01:52:15,895 --> 01:52:18,022
Besides, there won't be a need
for all that.

2303
01:52:18,173 --> 01:52:19,174
Lady Tsunade.

2304
01:52:19,618 --> 01:52:20,619
Lord Sixth…

2305
01:52:21,067 --> 01:52:23,444
Actually that rule
was put into effect

2306
01:52:24,609 --> 01:52:27,573
when there was a sudden
upswing in weddings…

2307
01:52:28,115 --> 01:52:31,077
…and there was
a serious shortage of manpower.

2308
01:52:32,082 --> 01:52:34,501
In addition, that was during
the Great Ninja War.

2309
01:52:35,246 --> 01:52:36,869
The situation is different today.

2310
01:52:38,542 --> 01:52:42,838
And more importantly,
the present Hokage is you, Kakashi.

2311
01:52:43,673 --> 01:52:45,424
Don't get caught up in old rules.

2312
01:52:45,716 --> 01:52:48,803
Choose the path that you believe
is most fair and just.

2313
01:52:49,432 --> 01:52:52,852
Then you'll choose to
let us all work, right?

2314
01:52:53,224 --> 01:52:54,558
That won't do.

2315
01:52:54,558 --> 01:52:56,477
Why not?!

2316
01:52:57,103 --> 01:52:58,479
My job is

2317
01:52:58,504 --> 01:53:01,716
to ensure that anyone who wants to
celebrate with Naruto and Hinata,

2318
01:53:01,741 --> 01:53:03,576
is able to attend.

2319
01:53:03,943 --> 01:53:05,653
I won't allow any early departures
or any late arrivals.

2320
01:53:05,653 --> 01:53:07,947
But there's no way around it.

2321
01:53:08,572 --> 01:53:09,824
I'll do something.

2322
01:53:24,875 --> 01:53:25,876
Hinata?

2323
01:53:27,007 --> 01:53:28,384
If it isn't Hinata!

2324
01:53:32,638 --> 01:53:34,223
Iruka Sensei…

2325
01:53:36,767 --> 01:53:37,935
What?!

2326
01:53:38,644 --> 01:53:42,064
Did Naruto do something?!

2327
01:53:42,465 --> 01:53:43,103
Huh?

2328
01:53:45,216 --> 01:53:46,425
Forgive me, Hinata!

2329
01:53:46,652 --> 01:53:50,448
I never taught him about
how to treat women!

2330
01:53:50,479 --> 01:53:54,399
I mean, I don't even know
about that kind of thing!

2331
01:53:58,590 --> 01:54:00,509
I don't know what happened,
but please…

2332
01:54:00,666 --> 01:54:01,507
For me…

2333
01:54:01,532 --> 01:54:03,826
Please forgive Naruto!

2334
01:54:05,426 --> 01:54:06,677
I beg of you!

2335
01:54:14,181 --> 01:54:15,725
What's so funny?

2336
01:54:17,865 --> 01:54:19,143
Iruka Sensei…

2337
01:54:19,483 --> 01:54:21,569
I didn't say anything,

2338
01:54:21,594 --> 01:54:24,806
but you decided that Naruto
must've done something bad

2339
01:54:25,035 --> 01:54:26,620
and started to apologize…

2340
01:54:27,026 --> 01:54:28,819
Oh? That's not it?

2341
01:54:35,155 --> 01:54:39,893
It didn't even cross my mind
that having a wedding

2342
01:54:39,918 --> 01:54:41,962
would trouble so many people.

2343
01:54:42,561 --> 01:54:45,606
But thinking back on this,
I guess I should have known.

2344
01:54:46,174 --> 01:54:49,177
It's not just for us…

2345
01:54:49,757 --> 01:54:52,843
but Naruto's a hero that connects
every village together.

2346
01:54:54,770 --> 01:54:56,938
I was probably being naïve

2347
01:54:56,963 --> 01:55:00,467
just thinking about marrying
the man I'd loved for so long.

2348
01:55:00,687 --> 01:55:02,522
You're wrong, Hinata!

2349
01:55:02,853 --> 01:55:03,854
Huh?

2350
01:55:11,142 --> 01:55:13,034
No matter how great he becomes,

2351
01:55:13,402 --> 01:55:15,148
no matter how big a hero
he becomes,

2352
01:55:15,493 --> 01:55:16,869
Naruto will always be Naruto…

2353
01:55:17,462 --> 01:55:20,382
To me and to everyone.

2354
01:55:22,998 --> 01:55:24,333
Iruka Sensei…

2355
01:55:25,125 --> 01:55:27,753
Nothing will change our desire to
wish the best for you and Naruto…

2356
01:55:28,504 --> 01:55:30,673
So, don't think of it
as a big fuss.

2357
01:55:32,145 --> 01:55:32,847
Yes!

2358
01:55:38,369 --> 01:55:39,544
I see…

2359
01:55:40,025 --> 01:55:42,319
I feel bad for
what I put Hinata through.

2360
01:55:42,852 --> 01:55:44,442
I'm sorry too, Iruka Sensei.

2361
01:55:44,692 --> 01:55:47,922
Oh no, I understand how
Hinata feels too.

2362
01:55:48,571 --> 01:55:52,149
Naruto's someone that connects
everyone in every village together.

2363
01:55:53,264 --> 01:55:54,891
Every village…

2364
01:55:59,785 --> 01:56:01,495
Thank you, Iruka Sensei!

2365
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:03,063
I know what I have to do!

2366
01:56:04,036 --> 01:56:06,747
Huh? What do you mean?

2367
01:56:07,042 --> 01:56:10,254
I just have to
bow my head a little, that's all.

2368
01:56:10,310 --> 01:56:11,520
Iruka Sensei!

2369
01:56:11,764 --> 01:56:13,791
I know you're in there!

2370
01:56:14,606 --> 01:56:18,318
At this rate, I'll be the only one
without a wedding gift!

2371
01:56:20,150 --> 01:56:20,962
What is it?

2372
01:56:23,430 --> 01:56:27,226
Now that Hinata's found out about
the wedding gifts from everyone…

2373
01:56:27,771 --> 01:56:29,607
it's no longer a surprise.

2374
01:56:30,712 --> 01:56:33,715
So Konohamaru, I think
I'm going to put you to work!

2375
01:56:34,236 --> 01:56:35,946
Huh? Huh?

2376
01:56:36,445 --> 01:56:37,446
What is it?

2377
01:56:42,995 --> 01:56:44,079
And so,

2378
01:56:44,111 --> 01:56:46,823
would it be possible to dispatch
some Hidden Sand shinobi

2379
01:56:46,848 --> 01:56:48,725
on the day of the wedding?

2380
01:56:52,713 --> 01:56:54,840
I kindly implore you.

2381
01:56:55,424 --> 01:56:57,509
Please raise your head, Lord Sixth.

2382
01:56:58,135 --> 01:57:00,554
The Raikage, Tsuchikage
and Mizukage,

2383
01:57:00,757 --> 01:57:02,967
and I have all been thinking about
what we can do.

2384
01:57:03,413 --> 01:57:05,623
We didn't want to overdo things…

2385
01:57:06,495 --> 01:57:09,206
I plan on celebrating with them
personally as Naruto's friend,

2386
01:57:09,396 --> 01:57:12,816
but I also wanted to do something
as the Kazekage.

2387
01:57:13,192 --> 01:57:16,403
Now then, we'll gladly cooperate.

2388
01:57:16,904 --> 01:57:20,658
This is all possible because of
the peaceful bond that was forged…

2389
01:57:21,033 --> 01:57:23,285
And it was through
Naruto's strength.

2390
01:57:23,821 --> 01:57:26,824
It's only fitting that we help
to make Naruto's wedding

2391
01:57:26,889 --> 01:57:28,223
a great success.

2392
01:57:28,898 --> 01:57:30,025
Thank you very much.

2393
01:57:30,684 --> 01:57:34,563
Then may I be so bold
as to ask for one more favor?

2394
01:57:34,588 --> 01:57:36,215
What is it? Please tell me.

2395
01:57:39,596 --> 01:57:40,847
Konohamaru! Come here!

2396
01:57:41,637 --> 01:57:42,399
Yes, sir!

2397
01:57:48,227 --> 01:57:52,386
Oh, a video message!
Gaara, say something!

2398
01:57:52,411 --> 01:57:53,666
Say what?

2399
01:57:54,002 --> 01:57:55,921
Like a proverb or something!

2400
01:57:56,181 --> 01:57:58,140
I can't come up with
something just like that!

2401
01:57:58,235 --> 01:58:02,406
Come on! You're no Kazekage if
you can't come up with a proverb!

2402
01:58:02,533 --> 01:58:03,534
That's right.

2403
01:58:12,701 --> 01:58:15,162
Iruka Sensei, what's this all about?

2404
01:58:15,162 --> 01:58:19,291
Remember, you recorded me before?

2405
01:58:19,741 --> 01:58:21,117
Huh? Oh yeah…

2406
01:58:21,335 --> 01:58:24,004
That boring message with no
style or punch?

2407
01:58:24,029 --> 01:58:25,113
<i>Congratulations on your marriage.</i>

2408
01:58:25,214 --> 01:58:29,134
C'mon, don't say that.
Could you just use that one?

2409
01:58:29,333 --> 01:58:32,388
But you said you wanted
to re-do it,

2410
01:58:32,471 --> 01:58:34,932
so I've been waiting around
this whole time!

2411
01:58:35,026 --> 01:58:36,361
I'm sorry about that.

2412
01:58:36,793 --> 01:58:38,878
But the more I think about it,

2413
01:58:39,002 --> 01:58:41,754
the less sure I am about
what to say to Naruto.

2414
01:58:41,910 --> 01:58:44,079
But you held out for so long,

2415
01:58:44,262 --> 01:58:46,139
so you should just
make up your mind

2416
01:58:46,164 --> 01:58:47,827
and send him a cool,
heartfelt message, okay?

2417
01:58:47,852 --> 01:58:50,217
You're the only one left!

2418
01:58:50,572 --> 01:58:54,477
I'm sorry. I'll treat to you a bowl of
ramen next time, so please forgive me!

2419
01:58:54,687 --> 01:58:55,367
Okay?

2420
01:58:55,704 --> 01:58:58,248
Hey! Tsukune, Sansho, Mibuna!

2421
01:58:58,515 --> 01:59:01,047
You were messing around with the
Third Hokage's statue again, weren't you?!

2422
01:59:06,378 --> 01:59:08,242
I can't believe it's almost next week…

2423
01:59:08,352 --> 01:59:09,923
Naruto's wedding.

2424
01:59:10,446 --> 01:59:13,693
Will you be making
an official congratulatory speech?

2425
01:59:14,045 --> 01:59:19,551
Oh no...I think Lord Hokage
will be taking care of that.

2426
01:59:25,024 --> 01:59:26,483
Iruka Sensei!

2427
01:59:27,938 --> 01:59:29,272
Oh, you're Ichiraku's—!

2428
01:59:29,584 --> 01:59:30,836
Is anything the matter?

2429
01:59:30,865 --> 01:59:32,987
You haven't been around
at all lately.

2430
01:59:33,234 --> 01:59:36,112
Oh, I just wanted to hold off
until I figured out

2431
01:59:36,194 --> 01:59:39,134
what to say for the message
that Konohamaru asked me to do.

2432
01:59:39,647 --> 01:59:41,816
I have to practice some self-restraint.

2433
01:59:42,069 --> 01:59:44,905
So…Did you finish your message?

2434
01:59:45,306 --> 01:59:47,767
Well…uh…

2435
01:59:48,696 --> 01:59:50,803
I'll stop by again soon.

2436
01:59:51,216 --> 01:59:53,343
Please say hello to your dad.

2437
01:59:59,794 --> 02:00:02,145
What? That's easy!

2438
02:00:02,170 --> 02:00:04,130
Then can you jump to here?!

2439
02:00:06,440 --> 02:00:07,493
Oww!

2440
02:00:07,518 --> 02:00:08,493
I knew it.

2441
02:00:08,620 --> 02:00:09,496
Shut up!

2442
02:00:09,564 --> 02:00:11,108
I won't lose at fence-jumping though!

2443
02:00:11,320 --> 02:00:13,117
<i>It's all thanks to you.</i>

2444
02:00:14,033 --> 02:00:18,660
<i>You acknowledged me back then.</i>

2445
02:00:19,095 --> 02:00:20,680
<i>That was the first time.</i>

2446
02:00:21,580 --> 02:00:24,750
<i>That's why, I am who I am today.</i>

2447
02:00:26,001 --> 02:00:27,544
<i>I was able to change.</i>

2448
02:00:29,139 --> 02:00:33,050
<i>Naruto expressed
his feelings so directly.</i>

2449
02:00:34,012 --> 02:00:36,636
<i>What am I doing?</i>

2450
02:00:50,067 --> 02:00:50,901
Oh man…

2451
02:00:51,036 --> 02:00:53,622
I really shouldn't do things
I'm not used to!

2452
02:00:57,366 --> 02:00:58,167
Huh?

2453
02:00:59,004 --> 02:00:59,807
Yes?

2454
02:01:06,533 --> 02:01:07,617
Naruto!

2455
02:01:08,571 --> 02:01:10,879
H-Hey, Iruka Sensei…

2456
02:01:11,151 --> 02:01:12,965
W-What's wrong?

2457
02:01:13,788 --> 02:01:16,457
Nothing. It's…well…

2458
02:01:16,819 --> 02:01:20,656
I was thinking about you.

2459
02:01:20,681 --> 02:01:22,611
And I just stopped by
to see if you were alive!

2460
02:01:22,636 --> 02:01:24,054
What the hell's that about?

2461
02:01:24,391 --> 02:01:27,020
You know,
I'm gonna be getting married.

2462
02:01:27,171 --> 02:01:28,614
And you're still single and all,

2463
02:01:28,639 --> 02:01:30,320
so I was worried about you
being alone.

2464
02:01:30,345 --> 02:01:31,930
I'm coming in!

2465
02:01:31,955 --> 02:01:33,749
Hey, wait! I'm in the middle of…

2466
02:01:35,445 --> 02:01:36,788
What happened?

2467
02:01:36,843 --> 02:01:38,762
Uh, just some stuff.

2468
02:01:39,158 --> 02:01:41,618
But what about you?
What's going on?

2469
02:01:41,724 --> 02:01:43,309
Uh…well…

2470
02:01:43,709 --> 02:01:45,669
Oh yeah! R-Ramen!

2471
02:01:45,831 --> 02:01:47,416
Want to go get some ramen?

2472
02:01:47,619 --> 02:01:48,709
Ramen?

2473
02:01:49,209 --> 02:01:52,087
Actually, I'm making dinner
right now.

2474
02:01:52,171 --> 02:01:54,089
Oh, that explains
this crime scene right here.

2475
02:01:54,235 --> 02:01:55,674
Y-Yeah…

2476
02:01:55,850 --> 02:01:59,388
You really should hurry up
and get married, Iruka Sensei!

2477
02:01:59,469 --> 02:02:00,470
Shut up!

2478
02:02:00,554 --> 02:02:01,487
What about you?

2479
02:02:01,512 --> 02:02:03,618
Are you sure you should
be neglecting Hinata right now?

2480
02:02:03,643 --> 02:02:05,270
"Neglecting"?

2481
02:02:05,601 --> 02:02:08,437
We're not married yet,
so don't worry about it.

2482
02:02:09,059 --> 02:02:10,397
Don't worry about it?

2483
02:02:10,907 --> 02:02:13,076
My single days are numbered!

2484
02:02:13,275 --> 02:02:14,943
I'm gonna have fun
with everything I've got—

2485
02:02:14,968 --> 02:02:16,345
You fool!

2486
02:02:18,109 --> 02:02:20,949
Do you even have a clue about

2487
02:02:21,214 --> 02:02:24,296
how hard Hinata is working,
preparing for your wedding?!

2488
02:02:24,536 --> 02:02:26,580
What's wrong, Iruka Sensei?

2489
02:02:27,569 --> 02:02:29,106
It seems there were a lot of things

2490
02:02:29,131 --> 02:02:31,675
I failed to teach you
on how to be a human!

2491
02:02:32,179 --> 02:02:33,879
I take full responsibility!

2492
02:02:35,678 --> 02:02:36,679
Come with me!

2493
02:02:36,851 --> 02:02:38,233
I'm gonna knock some sense
into you!

2494
02:02:38,258 --> 02:02:38,940
Huh?

2495
02:02:39,949 --> 02:02:41,909
Where are we going, Iruka Sensei?!

2496
02:02:42,054 --> 02:02:43,555
To Hinata's!

2497
02:02:43,898 --> 02:02:45,816
I'm going to apologize to her

2498
02:02:45,841 --> 02:02:48,886
for raising you into such
a thoughtless man.

2499
02:02:49,007 --> 02:02:50,341
Please stop!

2500
02:02:50,874 --> 02:02:52,793
If Hinata's around,
I won't be able to say

2501
02:02:52,818 --> 02:02:54,236
what I wanted to talk to you about!

2502
02:02:55,067 --> 02:02:56,860
What do you want to talk about?

2503
02:02:56,991 --> 02:03:00,405
T-That's why I thought
we could have some ramen,

2504
02:03:00,489 --> 02:03:04,284
and you could have
a drink or two…

2505
02:03:04,368 --> 02:03:07,287
and we could have
an enjoyable conversation and

2506
02:03:07,394 --> 02:03:08,538
have some fun.

2507
02:03:08,580 --> 02:03:09,665
Enough.

2508
02:03:13,442 --> 02:03:15,409
I guess I didn't need to mull over

2509
02:03:15,629 --> 02:03:20,050
what to say and
how to congratulate you.

2510
02:03:27,724 --> 02:03:29,184
I have a request…

2511
02:03:31,301 --> 02:03:32,200
A request?

2512
02:03:37,787 --> 02:03:42,083
Will you attend the ceremony
as my father?

2513
02:03:45,575 --> 02:03:46,576
Naruto…?

2514
02:03:47,160 --> 02:03:50,706
Is that what you wanted
to talk about?

2515
02:04:10,767 --> 02:04:12,300
You can leave it to me!

2516
02:04:14,633 --> 02:04:15,981
Iruka Sensei!

2517
02:04:19,374 --> 02:04:20,152
Thank you.

2518
02:04:21,095 --> 02:04:23,597
What are you talking about, Naruto?

2519
02:04:23,905 --> 02:04:26,241
I should be saying that.
Thank you!

2520
02:04:27,784 --> 02:04:29,578
Cut it out.

2521
02:04:29,786 --> 02:04:31,621
See you later, Iruka Sensei!

2522
02:04:33,133 --> 02:04:33,999
Yeah!

2523
02:04:48,128 --> 02:04:49,254
Good evening…

2524
02:04:49,765 --> 02:04:50,849
– Hey!
– Oh…

2525
02:04:51,144 --> 02:04:53,018
– Welcome!
– What's going on?

2526
02:04:53,560 --> 02:04:55,729
Something troublin' you again?

2527
02:04:56,021 --> 02:04:57,356
Huh? No…

2528
02:04:57,720 --> 02:05:01,516
I was just thinking about how glad
I am I chose this profession.

2529
02:05:02,069 --> 02:05:03,070
I see.

2530
02:05:03,302 --> 02:05:05,030
So, what'll you have today?

2531
02:05:05,169 --> 02:05:10,049
Oh! A large miso char siu ramen topped
with naruto fishcake.

2532
02:05:10,380 --> 02:05:12,554
One large miso char siu ramen!

2533
02:05:12,668 --> 02:05:14,879
Okay, one large-size miso
char siu ramen coming right up!

2534
02:05:27,010 --> 02:05:28,011
Hinata!

2535
02:05:29,529 --> 02:05:30,864
Iruka Sensei?

2536
02:05:30,931 --> 02:05:33,058
How are the preparations going?

2537
02:05:33,225 --> 02:05:34,101
Just about all done.

2538
02:05:34,126 --> 02:05:35,961
Now, we just have to wait
for the big day.

2539
02:05:36,159 --> 02:05:38,078
That's good.

2540
02:05:38,688 --> 02:05:40,941
Anyway, I…
have something to tell you.

2541
02:05:41,525 --> 02:05:44,027
It's about the wedding ceremony…

2542
02:05:44,215 --> 02:05:48,052
You're going to attend
as Naruto's father, aren't you?

2543
02:05:48,494 --> 02:05:50,455
Oh, you knew?

2544
02:05:51,055 --> 02:05:52,268
Yeah, of course you would!

2545
02:05:53,429 --> 02:05:56,422
Seems it was on Naruto's mind
for a long time.

2546
02:05:57,182 --> 02:06:00,794
You're definitely
Naruto's teacher, Iruka Sensei.

2547
02:06:01,225 --> 02:06:03,355
But he didn't want to consider
your relationship

2548
02:06:03,380 --> 02:06:05,507
simply as a "student-teacher"
or "mentor" relationship.

2549
02:06:06,008 --> 02:06:06,641
Huh?!

2550
02:06:07,426 --> 02:06:09,928
<i>But I kind of feel like
it shouldn't be coming</i>

2551
02:06:09,928 --> 02:06:12,305
<i>from the point of view
of a teacher to his student.</i>

2552
02:06:13,786 --> 02:06:16,852
<i>Naruto was thinking
the same thing as I was.</i>

2553
02:06:18,061 --> 02:06:22,691
And so, his answer was to ask me
to attend as his father.

2554
02:06:23,316 --> 02:06:24,317
Yes.

2555
02:06:24,821 --> 02:06:28,700
And so, please continue
to support him, Father!

2556
02:06:32,325 --> 02:06:33,618
Y-Yes…

2557
02:06:34,328 --> 02:06:38,081
It's sort of embarrassing
to be asked so formally.

2558
02:06:41,877 --> 02:06:43,336
So anyway…

2559
02:06:45,881 --> 02:06:47,340
What is this?

2560
02:06:47,804 --> 02:06:50,784
It's not much, but please put it
toward the reception fees.

2561
02:06:50,927 --> 02:06:51,970
What?!

2562
02:06:52,199 --> 02:06:55,140
Naruto asked me to stand in
as his father.

2563
02:06:55,481 --> 02:06:57,441
I have to do this much, at least.

2564
02:06:57,492 --> 02:06:59,744
Please don't worry about that!

2565
02:07:00,417 --> 02:07:01,271
Please!

2566
02:07:01,778 --> 02:07:03,030
I-Is that so?

2567
02:07:03,732 --> 02:07:06,818
I guess I'll just have to
accept your answer

2568
02:07:06,843 --> 02:07:08,261
and wait for the big day.

2569
02:07:08,762 --> 02:07:12,034
I wish I could've done something
fatherly though…

2570
02:07:14,100 --> 02:07:15,393
W-What is it?

2571
02:07:17,329 --> 02:07:19,895
You look just like my father,
with that expression.

2572
02:07:21,061 --> 02:07:23,460
You're already acting like
the father of the groom.

2573
02:07:23,627 --> 02:07:24,878
Y-You think so?

2574
02:07:31,207 --> 02:07:33,042
3…2…

2575
02:07:33,917 --> 02:07:34,642
1…

2576
02:07:35,305 --> 02:07:36,389
Rolling!

2577
02:07:38,457 --> 02:07:39,920
Naruto, Hinata…

2578
02:07:40,266 --> 02:07:41,673
Congratulations on your wedding!

2579
02:07:42,070 --> 02:07:42,887
Naruto!

2580
02:07:47,776 --> 02:07:49,694
What's the matter, Iruka Sensei?

2581
02:07:49,861 --> 02:07:51,821
Lost for words again?

2582
02:07:51,947 --> 02:07:53,490
Oh, sorry, sorry.

2583
02:07:53,740 --> 02:07:55,367
This time, I'll do it right!

2584
02:07:55,679 --> 02:07:58,145
So can I start over,
just one more time?

2585
02:08:05,768 --> 02:08:07,103
Naruto, Hinata…

2586
02:08:07,509 --> 02:08:08,929
Congratulations on your wedding!

2587
02:08:09,035 --> 02:08:12,320
Please create a home
as bright as the morning sun!

2588
02:08:12,345 --> 02:08:13,429
May you always be happy!

2589
02:08:13,454 --> 02:08:14,819
Happy wedding!

2590
02:08:14,919 --> 02:08:15,795
Congratulations!

2591
02:08:15,965 --> 02:08:16,821
Do your best!

2592
02:08:16,892 --> 02:08:19,145
Don't gorge yourself on
delicious home-cooked meals!

2593
02:08:19,566 --> 02:08:20,242
Congratulations.

2594
02:08:20,511 --> 02:08:21,309
Congratulations!

2595
02:08:21,771 --> 02:08:25,441
Mr. Naruto! Miss Hinata!
Congratulations!

2596
02:08:28,533 --> 02:08:30,743
Congratulations on your wedding!

2597
02:08:30,768 --> 02:08:33,270
Stop by once in a while for
miso char siu ramen, okay?

2598
02:08:33,585 --> 02:08:34,878
Congratulations, you two.

2599
02:08:35,007 --> 02:08:36,091
Congratulations!

2600
02:08:36,361 --> 02:08:39,407
Naruto, Miss Hinata…
A lot of things have happened,

2601
02:08:39,432 --> 02:08:40,808
But congratulations on your wedding.

2602
02:08:40,833 --> 02:08:43,002
Big Brother Naruto, you did it!

2603
02:08:43,139 --> 02:08:44,849
I'm gonna do my best too!

2604
02:08:45,014 --> 02:08:47,308
Naruto Uzumaki,
congratulations on your wedding.

2605
02:08:47,627 --> 02:08:49,421
Dear Naruto, do your best.

2606
02:08:49,421 --> 02:08:50,422
Yeah!

2607
02:08:55,271 --> 02:08:57,753
Naruto, Hinata…
Congratulations on your wedding!

2608
02:08:58,438 --> 02:09:01,774
Help each other and may you
have long lasting happiness!

2609
02:09:05,889 --> 02:09:08,559
Naruto! Hinata!
Congratulations on your wedding!

2610
02:09:09,304 --> 02:09:13,058
Hinata, Naruto is absent-minded
and reckless

2611
02:09:13,294 --> 02:09:15,254
and will need your support.

2612
02:09:15,294 --> 02:09:17,767
I ask you to
please take care of him!

2613
02:09:18,940 --> 02:09:21,609
Naruto, I just have this
to say to you…

2614
02:09:21,807 --> 02:09:23,893
You better make Hinata happy!

2615
02:09:26,894 --> 02:09:30,731
Okay! That was perfect!

2616
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:34,185
Phew…

2617
02:09:34,607 --> 02:09:36,567
It went without a hitch!

2618
02:09:47,546 --> 02:09:48,672
Uh…

2619
02:09:48,755 --> 02:09:51,383
Could you get
the receiving desk set up?

2620
02:09:51,456 --> 02:09:52,498
Lord Kakashi!

2621
02:09:53,389 --> 02:09:56,142
Like I said, drop the "lord."

2622
02:09:56,439 --> 02:09:58,691
The Lords Kage have arrived.

2623
02:09:58,776 --> 02:10:00,403
Huh? Already?!

2624
02:10:00,850 --> 02:10:02,185
Shall I escort them?

2625
02:10:02,349 --> 02:10:04,274
Yes. It's rude to keep them waiting.

2626
02:10:05,274 --> 02:10:05,977
Huh?

2627
02:10:06,169 --> 02:10:08,088
Hey, Kazekage entourage!

2628
02:10:08,392 --> 02:10:12,479
We're the Lightning entourage…
Here to give our wedding blessings.

2629
02:10:12,504 --> 02:10:14,798
So forget the past…
Let's be friends 'til the last.

2630
02:10:14,823 --> 02:10:16,116
Of course!

2631
02:10:16,366 --> 02:10:18,618
I don't feel like fighting
like brats anymore.

2632
02:10:19,244 --> 02:10:22,038
Oh say, see my gift
and be surprised

2633
02:10:22,063 --> 02:10:23,747
Even the couple will rapturize.

2634
02:10:23,772 --> 02:10:24,731
Enough already!

2635
02:10:26,781 --> 02:10:29,242
The reception desk is now open.

2636
02:10:29,380 --> 02:10:31,859
– Hey, where'd Temari go?
– Please sign in, in order of arrival.

2637
02:10:31,884 --> 02:10:33,261
I haven't seen her since we came.

2638
02:10:36,174 --> 02:10:39,219
How much are you giving them,
Ebisu Sensei?

2639
02:10:39,723 --> 02:10:41,850
Well, it's accepted etiquette
for working adults like us

2640
02:10:41,875 --> 02:10:43,425
to give about…

2641
02:10:43,450 --> 02:10:44,160
Huh?!

2642
02:10:44,185 --> 02:10:45,895
It's okay to give that little?

2643
02:10:45,979 --> 02:10:48,023
I put five bills in my envelope.

2644
02:10:48,106 --> 02:10:48,898
What?!

2645
02:10:49,028 --> 02:10:50,905
Did you say five?!

2646
02:10:51,278 --> 02:10:54,073
<i>I'll lose face as a teacher.</i>

2647
02:10:54,419 --> 02:10:56,156
You mean, our wedding gift?

2648
02:10:56,393 --> 02:10:57,716
We'll be giving…

2649
02:10:57,741 --> 02:10:59,075
…this!

2650
02:10:59,576 --> 02:11:01,202
Not that one, Dad!

2651
02:11:01,428 --> 02:11:04,264
Huh? Oh…this one.

2652
02:11:04,289 --> 02:11:05,790
Seriously?

2653
02:11:06,471 --> 02:11:07,565
Now listen, Lee!

2654
02:11:07,590 --> 02:11:10,301
When we honor people,
we hone our mind and spirit.

2655
02:11:10,668 --> 02:11:12,419
That's what a reception's for!

2656
02:11:12,464 --> 02:11:15,800
What you mean is, to
never forget to train, even at a party!

2657
02:11:15,884 --> 02:11:17,260
Naturally!

2658
02:11:17,260 --> 02:11:19,846
Look, people are staring like
you're weird, so will you cut it out?

2659
02:11:19,846 --> 02:11:22,432
We'll start with dumbbell juggling!
Let's go!

2660
02:11:22,641 --> 02:11:23,975
Yes, Guy Sensei!

2661
02:11:28,270 --> 02:11:30,948
What a day! What a joyous day!

2662
02:11:30,973 --> 02:11:32,349
Yes! This training is especially joyous!

2663
02:11:32,374 --> 02:11:34,460
You two have too much joy
in your heads!

2664
02:11:37,232 --> 02:11:39,631
So? Did you get a hold
of the honey wine?

2665
02:11:39,866 --> 02:11:40,950
Of course!

2666
02:11:41,451 --> 02:11:45,455
We're gonna tell Naruto about
the history of the Senju Clan.

2667
02:11:46,106 --> 02:11:49,025
You're that versed in history
to do that?

2668
02:11:49,209 --> 02:11:51,211
Huh?! Well, yeah…

2669
02:11:51,461 --> 02:11:53,755
Why don't you run it by me first?

2670
02:11:53,780 --> 02:11:55,448
Well, that's…uh.

2671
02:11:55,632 --> 02:11:56,800
Giddy up!

2672
02:11:57,233 --> 02:11:58,183
Run!

2673
02:11:58,208 --> 02:11:59,543
Mirai, what are you doing?

2674
02:11:59,968 --> 02:12:01,262
Playing horsey-back!

2675
02:12:01,947 --> 02:12:03,223
Akamaru is a dog.

2676
02:12:03,533 --> 02:12:05,975
You can't ride a dog and
call it horsey-back riding.

2677
02:12:06,226 --> 02:12:07,936
Then, doggie-back riding!

2678
02:12:08,412 --> 02:12:12,541
True, it is doggie-back riding.
But Akamaru looks a little tired.

2679
02:12:13,066 --> 02:12:14,859
You might want to come down.

2680
02:12:15,043 --> 02:12:15,669
It's because…

2681
02:12:15,694 --> 02:12:17,654
No! I wanna ride some more!

2682
02:12:17,898 --> 02:12:19,441
I guess I have no choice.

2683
02:12:21,241 --> 02:12:23,326
Let's go Shino-back riding, then.

2684
02:12:23,800 --> 02:12:26,803
– Was Shino always that good
with little kids? – Higher! Higher!

2685
02:12:26,955 --> 02:12:31,000
Seems he thinks he might
be suited to teaching.

2686
02:12:33,360 --> 02:12:35,181
What are you smiling about?

2687
02:12:35,206 --> 02:12:37,208
Who said I was smiling?

2688
02:12:37,522 --> 02:12:38,982
Whatever…

2689
02:12:39,007 --> 02:12:41,509
Men go to wedding receptions

2690
02:12:41,636 --> 02:12:44,222
to meet the friends of the bride,
don't they?

2691
02:12:44,247 --> 02:12:45,415
That's not it.

2692
02:12:45,640 --> 02:12:48,143
What a drag! Let's go over there.

2693
02:12:48,226 --> 02:12:49,185
Hey!

2694
02:12:50,259 --> 02:12:51,969
Oh, sweet!

2695
02:12:52,355 --> 02:12:54,399
It's definitely gonna be sweet.

2696
02:12:55,074 --> 02:12:57,910
When did they hook up?

2697
02:12:58,813 --> 02:12:59,946
Who are you talking about?

2698
02:13:00,155 --> 02:13:01,573
Shikamaru and Temari…

2699
02:13:02,115 --> 02:13:04,409
Did you know they were like that?

2700
02:13:04,548 --> 02:13:05,197
Hmm.

2701
02:13:05,535 --> 02:13:09,914
Anyway, everyone probably
thinks about us the same way.

2702
02:13:33,313 --> 02:13:34,314
Sasuke…

2703
02:13:53,968 --> 02:13:55,678
What's the matter, Iruka Sensei?

2704
02:13:56,111 --> 02:13:57,887
Is something still worrying you?

2705
02:13:58,421 --> 02:13:59,422
Well…

2706
02:13:59,923 --> 02:14:01,174
It's going to be all right.

2707
02:14:01,426 --> 02:14:03,229
Thanks to you, Iruka Sensei,

2708
02:14:03,254 --> 02:14:05,840
we have guard duty covered
with enough shinobi.

2709
02:14:06,012 --> 02:14:08,681
No, that was all you, Kakashi.

2710
02:14:09,098 --> 02:14:11,392
No, I didn't do anything.

2711
02:14:12,185 --> 02:14:14,229
I just helped a little.

2712
02:14:14,813 --> 02:14:17,858
It's all thanks to the bonds
Naruto forged.

2713
02:14:18,399 --> 02:14:21,861
Naruto's here, and
that's why everyone is here today.

2714
02:14:23,659 --> 02:14:26,861
I'm sure he will make Hinata happy.

2715
02:14:27,909 --> 02:14:29,636
Are you still worried?

2716
02:14:30,353 --> 02:14:31,412
Well…

2717
02:14:31,976 --> 02:14:35,271
I forgot to prepare
my final message.

2718
02:14:45,009 --> 02:14:48,972
<i>Brother Neji…
I'm going to get married.</i>

2719
02:15:07,198 --> 02:15:09,158
Elder Sister! It's time!

2720
02:15:10,260 --> 02:15:11,244
All right!

2721
02:15:11,877 --> 02:15:13,079
Wow!

2722
02:15:13,128 --> 02:15:15,130
You look so beautiful, Elder Sister!

2723
02:15:15,555 --> 02:15:16,965
Doesn't she, Father?

2724
02:15:44,738 --> 02:15:46,322
Okay, ready to go?
