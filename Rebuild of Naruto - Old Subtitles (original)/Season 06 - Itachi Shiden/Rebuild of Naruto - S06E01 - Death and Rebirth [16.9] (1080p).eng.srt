1
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:46,796
<i>So this is…the Great Ninja War.</i>

2
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:58,099
Water! Water!

3
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,110
Th-Thank you…

4
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,305
<i>Ninja tools?</i>

5
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:28,880
Father…

6
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,966
Why did this shinobi
try to kill me?

7
00:01:32,839 --> 00:01:34,007
I didn't do anything…

8
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:35,970
Because this is war.

9
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:37,847
"War"?

10
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:40,185
It's not a war between people.

11
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,502
It's a war between nations.

12
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:47,150
That's why strangers
kill each other meaninglessly.

13
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,402
Is that what it is?

14
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,571
That is what the shinobi world is.

15
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,374
Listen, Itachi…

16
00:01:56,177 --> 00:01:57,927
Never forget this sight…

17
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:07,544
We managed an armistice,
but the sacrifice was just too great.

18
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,880
Lord Third intends to take
full responsibility and retire.

19
00:02:12,307 --> 00:02:15,227
There are voices in support of installing
you, Captain, as the Fourth Hokage.

20
00:02:15,252 --> 00:02:16,962
- Please…
- Enough talk.

21
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:20,914
What should we do
about Kakashi Hatake?

22
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,259
He doesn't belong to our clan,
but he possesses the Sharingan.

23
00:02:27,171 --> 00:02:30,090
I understand Obito Uchiha
fought bravely.

24
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:32,577
Let's respect his wishes.

25
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,281
We should bring the Sharingan
back to the Uchiha…

26
00:02:36,306 --> 00:02:38,058
The war just ended.

27
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,760
Do not sow seeds of discord.

28
00:02:41,146 --> 00:02:42,147
Yes, sir.

29
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,124
We finally have peace.

30
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,627
We will persevere to maintain it.

31
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,717
That is the duty of the Uchiha…

32
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:04,667
Grieving over the dead
is meaningless.

33
00:03:05,779 --> 00:03:10,034
If there's any meaning in death,
it's to take advantage of it.

34
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,985
What is the meaning of life?

35
00:03:14,908 --> 00:03:16,106
There is none.

36
00:03:17,177 --> 00:03:20,306
There's meaning in life if it's eternal.

37
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,388
<i>There's no meaning…</i>

38
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,515
<i>in life?</i>

39
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:33,495
No one wants to die, right?

40
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,757
<i>What is life, anyway?</i>

41
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,015
Please take care.

42
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,516
Thank you very much!

43
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,518
Mom…

44
00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:11,720
What is it?

45
00:05:12,596 --> 00:05:13,805
Are you sick?

46
00:05:14,598 --> 00:05:15,724
Oh, it's nothing like that.

47
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:18,735
You see…

48
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,947
You're going to have
a little brother or sister.

49
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:28,297
Yes. You're going to
be a big brother.

50
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,635
It's a boy!
He's your little brother.

51
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,307
<i>A life…</i>

52
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,642
<i>A new life.</i>

53
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:55,543
Have you decided on a name?

54
00:05:56,111 --> 00:05:57,112
Yes.

55
00:05:57,367 --> 00:05:58,368
Sasuke…

56
00:05:59,247 --> 00:06:00,373
Sasuke Uchiha.

57
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:04,189
Oh...It's a fine name, but that's…

58
00:06:04,774 --> 00:06:09,445
Yes, it's Lord Third's father's name.
I've already asked Lord Third.

59
00:06:10,181 --> 00:06:11,182
I see.

60
00:06:12,393 --> 00:06:13,394
Sasuke…

61
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:16,125
We shall raise him to never
dishonor his name.

62
00:06:20,608 --> 00:06:22,026
<i>There, there, Itachi!</i>

63
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,174
<i>Itachi!</i>

64
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:25,593
<i>Itachi!</i>

65
00:06:26,474 --> 00:06:29,269
<i>I'm like that too.</i>

66
00:06:38,462 --> 00:06:43,801
<i>Birth…death…birth…death…</i>

67
00:06:44,251 --> 00:06:45,252
Hey, hey!

68
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,910
Aren't you Itachi?
An Uchiha in my class?

69
00:06:51,486 --> 00:06:52,506
Let's play together.

70
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,372
What do you want to do today?

71
00:06:54,822 --> 00:06:56,583
Kick the can!
Let's play kick the can!

72
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:00,905
Huh?
We played that yesterday!

73
00:07:02,867 --> 00:07:05,356
Hey! Are you dissing us?

74
00:07:06,036 --> 00:07:07,256
Say something!

75
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,424
I have shuriken training right now.

76
00:07:11,821 --> 00:07:13,224
- Wow...
- Wow...

77
00:07:13,249 --> 00:07:14,443
Well then…

78
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:17,249
Let's practice shuriken too!

79
00:07:17,998 --> 00:07:18,869
No, don't!

80
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,520
That kid!

81
00:07:23,545 --> 00:07:26,185
Trying to act cool! What a stuck-up!

82
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,776
Hey, you guys. Stop it!

83
00:07:32,434 --> 00:07:35,812
Shut up!
This is between us guys!

84
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,416
<i>Life is born.</i>

85
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,296
<i>Life dies.</i>

86
00:07:47,461 --> 00:07:49,963
<i>Life is…a battle…</i>

87
00:07:50,897 --> 00:07:53,358
Hey! Don't run away!

88
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:07,945
Wow!

89
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,239
Was it a girl?

90
00:08:11,932 --> 00:08:13,016
It's a boy.

91
00:08:13,728 --> 00:08:15,396
He's so cute!

92
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,247
What's your name?

93
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:28,285
Hey Mom…

94
00:08:28,704 --> 00:08:31,582
Is Lord Fourth going to
have a baby too?

95
00:08:31,838 --> 00:08:34,528
Yes, I wonder what it'll be.

96
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:39,519
I'll be going out tonight,
so go ahead and have dinner.

97
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,603
Okay.

98
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,065
Your father's working too,
so please watch Sasuke.

99
00:08:44,437 --> 00:08:45,438
Uh-huh.

100
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:01,008
There's a full moon out tonight, Sasuke.

101
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,385
What…?

102
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,596
Come on out…

103
00:09:15,966 --> 00:09:16,967
Nine-Tails!

104
00:09:19,842 --> 00:09:20,843
There, there…

105
00:09:22,086 --> 00:09:23,365
Don't cry, Sasuke.

106
00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:27,452
No matter what happens, your big brother
will definitely protect you…

107
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,188
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

108
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,455
No way!

109
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,378
Go, Nine-Tails!

110
00:09:51,668 --> 00:09:53,234
This is an announcement
from the Leaf Police!

111
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,970
All civilians are to evacuate
to the southeast shelter!

112
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,181
The southeast shelter!

113
00:10:03,485 --> 00:10:07,948
Dad! Mom!

114
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,275
Come here!

115
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,507
Itachi!

116
00:10:16,895 --> 00:10:17,896
Hurry!

117
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:19,987
Okay!

118
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,713
We're going to the shelter.

119
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,469
This way! Hurry!

120
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:39,722
Mom!

121
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:40,931
Keep going.

122
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:41,932
Itachi?

123
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,476
Everyone will be there.

124
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,020
Please stay calm!

125
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,064
You're safe here!

126
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:49,565
Father!

127
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,502
I knew you would be all right.

128
00:10:54,138 --> 00:10:55,222
Get to the shelter quickly.

129
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:57,698
Okay.

130
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,169
We drove it out of the village.

131
00:11:09,614 --> 00:11:12,296
Don't let up. Keep attacking!

132
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,132
Just about everyone has
been evacuated.

133
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,593
Captain, we'll go after
the Nine-Tails as well.

134
00:11:17,823 --> 00:11:20,535
The Leaf Police Force is to remain
and protect the civilians.

135
00:11:20,696 --> 00:11:21,655
But Captain!

136
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,974
These are the Village's orders.

137
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:27,895
What was that just now?!

138
00:11:29,554 --> 00:11:31,806
Looks like they sealed the Nine-Tails…

139
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,931
…somehow.

140
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:03,013
Many lives were lost including the Fourth
Hokage Minato and his wife, Kushina…

141
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,598
The facts behind the incident
are still unknown…

142
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,103
<i>Life is born…</i>

143
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:15,943
But for now, let us
mourn our comrades…

144
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:20,156
<i>And life…dies.</i>

145
00:12:28,163 --> 00:12:29,247
Itachi!

146
00:12:32,154 --> 00:12:32,898
Um...

147
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:34,795
Thank you for before…

148
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,173
Because of you, I was safe!

149
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,084
I'm glad you didn't die.

150
00:12:46,576 --> 00:12:47,577
Your younger sister?

151
00:12:48,127 --> 00:12:49,211
Younger brother.

152
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,770
Can I hold him?

153
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,121
No.

154
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,397
Why not?

155
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,691
I don't want him to cry.

156
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,639
You're not gonna cry, are you?

157
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,366
There, there!

158
00:13:05,445 --> 00:13:06,446
There, there!

159
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:09,830
There, there!

160
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:16,401
Aww, come on!

161
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:24,053
The Nine-Tails' attack caused
devastation throughout the village.

162
00:13:24,575 --> 00:13:25,868
For the reconstruction,

163
00:13:25,893 --> 00:13:29,146
we've decided to revise a number
of the village's boundaries.

164
00:13:29,966 --> 00:13:33,345
We'd like the Aburame Clan
to move into this district.

165
00:13:34,274 --> 00:13:37,708
The clan previously submitted
a request to occupy the forest,

166
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,236
so we took that into consideration.

167
00:13:41,845 --> 00:13:44,497
The Nara Clan's territory was
not part of the stricken area,

168
00:13:44,522 --> 00:13:45,940
so they will remain where they are.

169
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,744
The Leaf Police Force headquarters
which sustained damage,

170
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,458
will be rebuilt here.

171
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,792
And the Uchiha Clan will move along
with the headquarters…

172
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,043
Lord Danzo!

173
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,463
The Uchiha Clan makes up the Leaf
Police Force that protects the Hidden Leaf.

174
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:02,744
As such, that location is too far
from the village center.

175
00:14:03,722 --> 00:14:05,891
We wouldn't be able to act swiftly
in an emergency.

176
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,765
We have the ANBU Black Ops
for such emergencies.

177
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:17,439
The Leaf Police has to commute
to the training grounds, does it not?

178
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:21,819
This location is near an area
that's ideal for training.

179
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:26,073
You can use that area exclusively
for the Uchiha's training grounds.

180
00:14:27,627 --> 00:14:28,628
Continuing on…

181
00:14:29,885 --> 00:14:32,414
In conjunction with the reconstruction
of the Leaf Police Headquarters,

182
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:34,941
the Uchiha Clan will also relocate.

183
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,936
Home and buildings that
were spared will be…

184
00:14:42,976 --> 00:14:44,644
During the Nine-Tails Incident,

185
00:14:44,669 --> 00:14:47,816
we Uchiha were not called upon
because they feared that

186
00:14:47,841 --> 00:14:50,253
we would use our Sharingan to
manipulate the Nine-Tails.

187
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:53,325
Even worse, there are some who say

188
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,810
that the Uchiha
caused the Nine-Tails Incident!

189
00:14:55,835 --> 00:14:59,254
They are sending us to the outskirts of
the village in order to keep an eye on us!

190
00:14:59,409 --> 00:15:01,578
This is just like during
the Second Hokage's era

191
00:15:01,663 --> 00:15:05,834
when the Uchiha were rounded up
and isolated in one part of the village!

192
00:15:06,049 --> 00:15:08,031
This time, it's even farther away!

193
00:15:08,056 --> 00:15:10,183
The village suspects us!

194
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:13,078
Captain, we can't accept this decision!

195
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,663
We should reject it outright!

196
00:15:14,935 --> 00:15:17,480
Captain!

197
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,002
You are absolutely right.

198
00:15:21,047 --> 00:15:23,966
But the other clans have accepted
their respective relocations as well.

199
00:15:24,815 --> 00:15:26,856
The Uchiha cannot be
the lone voice of dissent.

200
00:15:26,881 --> 00:15:28,215
But Captain!

201
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,471
I'll do what I can to negotiate
the conditions.

202
00:15:30,962 --> 00:15:33,548
But we must accept the move.

203
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:37,186
Pass the word around. That is all.

204
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,146
Dismissed.

205
00:15:41,944 --> 00:15:43,399
How do you feel?

206
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,319
Let's go and see it, Father.

207
00:15:47,623 --> 00:15:49,208
The new training grounds.

208
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,578
I like it here.

209
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,038
Is that so?

210
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,124
Father, teach me jutsu…

211
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,634
Generational Uchiha jutsu…

212
00:16:01,659 --> 00:16:02,660
All right!

213
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,222
This is a fundamental Uchiha ninjutsu…

214
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:15,759
Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu.

215
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,018
All right, the signs are…

216
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,486
I did it!

217
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,282
What a surprise.

218
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:34,703
That's my boy.

219
00:16:37,623 --> 00:16:39,291
We'll be moving in no time, huh?

220
00:16:40,268 --> 00:16:41,269
Yeah.

221
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,961
What's the matter?

222
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,299
<i>We're surrounded…</i>

223
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,973
<i>I wish it was my imagination, but…</i>

224
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,350
What is it?

225
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,019
It's nothing…

226
00:17:01,056 --> 00:17:04,101
"In no time," huh? The same could
be said about you, Itachi.

227
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,443
Since you're going to be
six years old soon.

228
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,407
There are too many
unanswered questions

229
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,225
surrounding this recent
Nine-Tails incident.

230
00:17:15,465 --> 00:17:18,426
I thought that Kushina's seal
had been broken.

231
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,750
But that doesn't explain why Biwako
and the ANBU were killed.

232
00:17:22,986 --> 00:17:25,669
Which means someone is behind this.

233
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,505
Like someone from the Uchiha?

234
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:30,299
Why do you say that?

235
00:17:30,525 --> 00:17:33,986
Even if the Nine-Tails broke free,
it would have just gone wild.

236
00:17:34,211 --> 00:17:38,048
Without someone to control it,
it couldn't have caused this incident.

237
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:39,975
Hence, the Sharingan...

238
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:44,271
The Uchiha can control the Nine-Tails
with their visual prowess...

239
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,898
But for what purpose?

240
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,356
To regain their position of power
within the Hidden Leaf Village.

241
00:17:49,556 --> 00:17:50,974
I see...

242
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:53,963
That's just conjecture.

243
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,506
We must increase our surveillance
of the Uchiha.

244
00:17:59,068 --> 00:18:03,155
We must keep them
under 24-hour watch.

245
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,876
That's bound to
incite them unnecessarily!

246
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:09,095
Let the ANBU do it secretly.

247
00:18:09,334 --> 00:18:11,336
Better to be safe than sorry.

248
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,444
Wait!

249
00:18:13,746 --> 00:18:16,416
We don't know if the Uchiha
are responsible for this.

250
00:18:16,441 --> 00:18:18,318
That's precisely why
this is necessary.

251
00:18:18,502 --> 00:18:20,045
And if nothing comes out of it...

252
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,618
it will be to the Uchiha's benefit.

253
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:40,990
Kushina...

254
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:56,093
Congratulations on your acceptance
into the Academy, everyone!

255
00:18:56,882 --> 00:18:57,966
From this day forth,

256
00:18:57,991 --> 00:19:02,412
do your best to reach your goals
to become a shinobi.

257
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:14,111
I'm sure some of you have already
been taught ninjutsu in your households…

258
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,238
But here at the Academy,
you will also train

259
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,616
to coordinate and work together as
a team when you are in a group.

260
00:19:19,883 --> 00:19:23,220
The fundamentals are very important,
make sure you learn them well.

261
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,458
All right, Kamano. What's the answer?

262
00:19:52,704 --> 00:19:54,471
I don't know!

263
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,279
Then…Itachi?

264
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,407
The seal is for the Water Style:
Water Bomb Jutsu.

265
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,075
Correct.

266
00:20:02,709 --> 00:20:03,877
Keep that in mind everyone.

267
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,245
It will be on the test.

268
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,207
Itachi…Come at me.

269
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,550
All right!

270
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,093
Begin!

271
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,061
The match is over!

272
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,527
Okay, okay…

273
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,950
Sorry, Sasuke.
Some other time, okay?

274
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,123
Welcome home, Father!

275
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,376
Please teach me jutsu!

276
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,086
Jutsu?

277
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,338
Aren't they teaching you
at the Academy?

278
00:20:57,363 --> 00:20:58,489
It's too easy.

279
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,262
I guess it would be for you.

280
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:05,764
Wait for me at the training grounds.

281
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,349
Okay!

282
00:21:07,596 --> 00:21:09,431
Make sure you're home by dinner.

283
00:21:10,104 --> 00:21:11,189
Got it!

284
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,941
Look over there! It's Itachi!

285
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:16,858
Where?

286
00:21:16,883 --> 00:21:18,682
Oh, he's walking. He's so cool!

287
00:21:18,707 --> 00:21:19,791
Oh, he's looking this way!

288
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,114
This is not good.

289
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,241
Don't you think, gentlemen?

290
00:21:24,838 --> 00:21:26,339
For his sake,

291
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:30,038
if he gets swept up by all of this
and gets the wrong idea…

292
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,665
I agree.

293
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,918
He's stuck up!

294
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,296
It's me! He's looking at me!

295
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,188
No, it's me!

296
00:21:38,425 --> 00:21:39,424
He started walking again!

297
00:21:39,449 --> 00:21:40,867
Itachi's walking!

298
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,592
He's walking!

299
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:47,764
It's decided then…

300
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,224
- Yeah!
- Right!

301
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,077
Ouch!

302
00:22:10,904 --> 00:22:13,202
Don't jump out at us like that, idiot!

303
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:17,085
"Idiot"? Who are you calling "idiot"?

304
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,338
You guys must be freshmen!

305
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,340
You…

306
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,176
…run into someone…

307
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,095
and call 'em an "idiot" …?

308
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,848
You ran into us!

309
00:22:30,001 --> 00:22:31,627
What did you say?!

310
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,107
Hold it!

311
00:22:45,308 --> 00:22:47,477
Who the hell are you?

312
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,701
A friend of theirs?

313
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,293
All the freshmen this year are…

314
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:03,298
…stuck up!

315
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,350
- Wow!
- Wow!

316
00:23:14,995 --> 00:23:16,330
Take him to the infirmary.

317
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,230
O-Okay.

318
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,566
Itachi, you're really strong, my friend!

319
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,151
"My friend"?

320
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:26,696
Even upperclassmen are
easy targets for you, sir!

321
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:27,948
"Sir"?

322
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,449
Move it, move it!

323
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,660
Master Itachi is coming through!

324
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,078
"Master"?

325
00:23:34,804 --> 00:23:36,306
Make way!

326
00:23:36,993 --> 00:23:38,578
It's Master Itachi!

327
00:23:39,247 --> 00:23:40,916
- Move it! Make way!
- Stop it…

328
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:42,546
- Outta the way!
- Please…

329
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,548
Don't…

330
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,969
<i>There is birth…</i>

331
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,847
<i>and death…</i>

332
00:23:55,953 --> 00:23:56,954
<i>Life…</i>

333
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,438
<i>flocks together…</i>

334
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,900
<i>What is a shinobi?</i>

335
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:09,072
<i>What is a village?</i>

336
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,909
First in every class,
according to your progress report…

337
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,786
That's my boy.

338
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:16,663
Father…

339
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:17,956
Hmm?

340
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,541
Teach me jutsu.

341
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,878
I want to know more
about being a shinobi.

342
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:25,630
In cases like this, always make sure
you have an escape route.

343
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:29,009
This is important.
If you're in a four-man team…

344
00:24:35,715 --> 00:24:37,419
You're very talented for your age.

345
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,148
I'm no match for you, Shisui.

346
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:45,567
Oh come on…

347
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,110
What's wrong?

348
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,654
Does the Academy bore you
so much that you're ditching?

349
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,450
I'm not ditching.

350
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,947
You guys! That's unfair!

351
00:25:31,979 --> 00:25:33,981
What's with that look?

352
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,419
Hey! Cut it out!

353
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,088
Hey you, stop!

354
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:55,845
Itachi!

355
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,097
Take this!

356
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,406
What happened?

357
00:26:14,764 --> 00:26:15,765
He disappeared?!

358
00:26:15,873 --> 00:26:18,125
Yeah, he disappeared!
He disappeared!

359
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,204
That's a clone…

360
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:22,789
No…

361
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,501
It's a Shadow Clone Jutsu!

362
00:26:26,026 --> 00:26:27,027
What's the matter?

363
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,256
I have to get back.

364
00:26:29,867 --> 00:26:30,956
You do?

365
00:26:32,868 --> 00:26:33,869
Shisui…

366
00:26:37,153 --> 00:26:39,072
Why is there fighting in life?

367
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:40,932
Who knows?

368
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,350
But…

369
00:26:43,901 --> 00:26:47,154
If the fighting can be stopped,
I'd like to stop it.

370
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:48,898
Me too!

371
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,114
See you later.

372
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,587
Aside from the clone jutsu

373
00:26:59,612 --> 00:27:02,865
which is a requirement for
graduating the Academy,

374
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:06,307
Itachi Uchiha has already mastered
the Shadow Clone Jutsu, a forbidden jutsu.

375
00:27:06,868 --> 00:27:08,954
He excels in all other subjects.

376
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,297
There's no purpose in keeping him
at the Academy any longer.

377
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,133
Isn't he just a freshman?

378
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,176
Yes.

379
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,970
That doesn't matter.
This has happened before.

380
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:21,681
That was a different era.

381
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:24,044
This is not the age of war.

382
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,853
The boy is a genius, no?

383
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:29,356
I've never seen a student like him.

384
00:27:30,445 --> 00:27:33,699
So it will be better for Itachi
to let him graduate?

385
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,321
Graduate?

386
00:27:36,846 --> 00:27:38,974
After only a year at the Academy?

387
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:40,533
Yeah.

388
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:44,128
The teacher said as long as
both parents agree.

389
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:46,498
They want to talk to you at school.

390
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:48,583
I see…

391
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,106
That's my boy.

392
00:28:05,144 --> 00:28:06,579
Graduates!

393
00:28:07,607 --> 00:28:11,402
You will now be assigned missions
from the village.

394
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:15,068
We'll be forming three-man teams

395
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,113
led by one jonin…

396
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:22,033
and you will be undertaking
your mission under their guidance.

397
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:28,498
And now, I will announce the teams!

398
00:29:01,463 --> 00:29:02,464
Father!

399
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:05,410
We'll discuss this again later.

400
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:10,932
Father!

401
00:29:11,277 --> 00:29:12,987
Returning from a mission, Itachi?

402
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,461
Yeah!

403
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:20,300
We haven't walked together
like this in a while.

404
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:24,080
Well, I'm a genin now…
and have I missions.

405
00:29:24,289 --> 00:29:25,708
Oh, I see!

406
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:28,683
That's right.

407
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,852
Since the Uchiha moved here…

408
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:43,114
…three years have passed.

409
00:29:46,122 --> 00:29:48,136
We were pushed to
the outskirts of the village,

410
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:51,206
and the upper echelons
took away our authority…

411
00:29:51,231 --> 00:29:54,070
Many still voice strong dissatisfaction
towards their methods.

412
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,880
You're aware of that too, right?

413
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,468
We want to regain
our power one day…

414
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,011
and step out from
the darkness into the light—

415
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,179
Father, look!

416
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,482
What's so funny?

417
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,150
Sorry, Father…

418
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,861
You're the face of the Uchiha.

419
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:25,114
I'm proud to be able to
walk alongside you.

420
00:30:25,581 --> 00:30:26,999
Enough flattery…

421
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,912
Should we get your favorite snack
on the way home?

422
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:33,665
Yeah!

423
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,753
It can't be helped
if they're all sold out…

424
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,381
Itachi?

425
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,342
Izumi…

426
00:30:49,518 --> 00:30:51,062
I'm sorry, Itachi.

427
00:30:51,229 --> 00:30:53,815
Are you sure I didn't interrupt
you and your dad?

428
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:56,350
Yeah...It's okay.

429
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,050
- It's been a while.
- Yeah.

430
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,651
It's the first time since
you became a genin.

431
00:31:02,023 --> 00:31:03,274
That's right!

432
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,613
I'm sorry I didn't get you
anything for your promotion…

433
00:31:06,018 --> 00:31:08,229
I didn't even congratulate you.

434
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:10,121
I'm really sorry!

435
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,573
You don't have to apologize
so much…

436
00:31:13,017 --> 00:31:16,171
This doesn't really qualify
as a gift.

437
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:19,303
But if you don't mind,
won't you have one?

438
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:25,216
My mom loves the tri-color
dumplings from that shop.

439
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:29,857
But I guess someone like you
who's brilliant and

440
00:31:29,882 --> 00:31:34,904
who excels in ninjutsu and taijutsu
and whizzed through the Academy…

441
00:31:34,997 --> 00:31:37,126
wouldn't have a sweet tooth.

442
00:31:37,847 --> 00:31:40,266
Sorry for just assuming…

443
00:31:41,089 --> 00:31:42,944
Well, since I opened them…

444
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,529
I guess I'll eat them all myself.

445
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,291
Don't tell me…

446
00:31:59,108 --> 00:32:00,109
Do you want one?

447
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,054
Is it strange?

448
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,222
Oh no, it isn't that.

449
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,266
I've known you for quite
some time,

450
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:18,269
but I didn't know what
your favorite foods were.

451
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,522
Rank and gender have
nothing to do

452
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,399
with what someone likes to eat.

453
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,193
Yeah, that's true.

454
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,611
Sorry.

455
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,203
I'm sorry…

456
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:38,915
It's because, Itachi…

457
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,626
You looked so ready
to use your Sharingan.

458
00:32:44,173 --> 00:32:45,758
It was funny.

459
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:48,716
Okay, I won't laugh anymore.
Sorry, Itachi!

460
00:32:53,001 --> 00:32:54,127
Sorry, sorry!

461
00:32:54,191 --> 00:32:55,943
Let me make it up to you.

462
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,393
Is there anything you want?

463
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:00,603
"Anything I want"?

464
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:01,980
Yeah!

465
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:07,679
That's right. She's…

466
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,241
Yeah...I thought so.

467
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:16,995
But that's something
I can't give you.

468
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,418
Hey!

469
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:27,964
We have another mission…

470
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,341
Stop flirting.

471
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,635
We are not flirting!

472
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,096
Itachi…

473
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,504
I can't give them to you…

474
00:33:38,687 --> 00:33:39,855
But I'll pray for you…

475
00:33:41,472 --> 00:33:44,480
I hope that your Sharingan
awakens really soon.

476
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:48,067
And when it does,
I'll congratulate you!

477
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,907
Thank you for your help.

478
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,619
I did tell him to hurry up
and settle down…

479
00:33:59,106 --> 00:34:01,483
But I never expected him
to fall in love…

480
00:34:02,506 --> 00:34:05,926
This one has good skills,
but no eye for judging females.

481
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:11,507
I just wanted to find the best bride
for the sake of our clan.

482
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,886
The most important thing
is that you're okay.

483
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:20,183
You fulfilled the mission just as I
requested…is what I'd like to say…

484
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,270
But what happened
to his whiskers?

485
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:28,327
To keep the fighting to a minimum,
there was no choice.

486
00:34:29,052 --> 00:34:30,549
So you cut them?

487
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:37,158
Well, it's my fault for not giving you
a heads up on his skills…

488
00:34:38,448 --> 00:34:40,450
You didn't bring them back?

489
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:43,414
No...they blew away in the wind.

490
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:52,381
Well, I guess it can't be helped.

491
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,550
Thank you for your efforts.

492
00:34:55,932 --> 00:34:56,933
Itachi…

493
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:58,907
Next time you come,

494
00:34:58,932 --> 00:35:02,892
I'll have you take care of the
debts the Uchiha have racked up.

495
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,276
Good thing you got
what you needed, eh?

496
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:14,403
Well, yeah…

497
00:35:15,157 --> 00:35:17,325
Cheer up, will ya?

498
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:20,118
The fate of your clan rests on it, right?

499
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,370
It's not that critical!

500
00:35:22,876 --> 00:35:23,877
But…

501
00:35:23,902 --> 00:35:27,531
If this cures my dad,
my clan will be secure.

502
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,504
<i>That ninja cat…</i>

503
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:33,798
<i>And those grownups…</i>

504
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:38,136
<i>They're all thinking about their clans…</i>

505
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:44,100
You'd better not be thinking
that you saved me.

506
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,893
The thought hasn't crossed my mind.

507
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:48,146
Even if you didn't end up
helping me…

508
00:35:50,937 --> 00:35:52,688
What are you doing?!

509
00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:55,286
Why are you still
saying stuff like that?

510
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,238
He's your friend!

511
00:35:57,263 --> 00:35:59,098
Of course, he's going to help you!

512
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:02,326
– Huh?! Me? His friend?!
– I was just fulfilling my mission.

513
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:10,001
You stop being
so difficult as well!

514
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:14,088
All right! Isn't there something
you want to say to Itachi?!

515
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,176
I swear I'll make it up
to you for this!

516
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:24,849
Why can't you just
say thank you?!

517
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:29,103
Shinko, that hurt too much!

518
00:36:30,941 --> 00:36:32,860
<i>Friend, huh?</i>

519
00:36:41,006 --> 00:36:43,008
Big Brother! What is this?

520
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,161
This is…from that time…

521
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:55,171
<i>Life is born, and life dies…</i>

522
00:36:56,002 --> 00:36:58,796
<i>But life is saved again…</i>

523
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:01,510
<i>Wait…</i>

524
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:04,033
<i>When I saved him back then,</i>

525
00:37:04,058 --> 00:37:06,686
<i>I didn't think too deeply about it.</i>

526
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:08,662
<i>He's your friend!</i>

527
00:37:08,687 --> 00:37:10,596
<i>Of course,
he's going to help you!</i>

528
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,026
<i>A clan grows…</i>

529
00:37:13,051 --> 00:37:14,261
<i>A village is born…</i>

530
00:37:14,648 --> 00:37:16,327
<i>And bonds are made…</i>

531
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:19,642
<i>If that's what friends are…</i>

532
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,740
<i>We were friends, no doubt about it.</i>

533
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:24,995
<i>We formed a bond…</i>

534
00:37:25,495 --> 00:37:26,830
<i>That's why that happened…</i>

535
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:36,637
<i>We had a bond…</i>

536
00:37:38,071 --> 00:37:39,297
<i>That's why he…</i>

537
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,642
<i>I swear I'll make it up
to you for this!</i>

538
00:37:58,349 --> 00:37:59,507
<i>…died.</i>

539
00:38:02,318 --> 00:38:04,362
<i>I didn't understand back then…</i>

540
00:38:05,487 --> 00:38:07,030
<i>What real pain was.</i>

541
00:38:08,491 --> 00:38:10,618
<i>The pain of losing a life…</i>

542
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:14,125
<i>I felt it for the first time
after losing it…</i>

543
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,085
<i>No, I was made to realize it…</i>

544
00:38:17,417 --> 00:38:20,420
<i>The feeling of not wanting
to lose something precious.</i>

545
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:24,427
Big Brother!

546
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:25,678
Your eyes!

547
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:32,226
<i>Will the day come when
you'll possess these eyes too?</i>

548
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,563
<i>The day when you come
to know what sadness is?</i>

549
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:48,933
Are you leaving already?

550
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,055
Yes.

551
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,412
I see…

552
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:55,958
You awakened your Sharingan
at age eight…

553
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,420
I supposed the Village wants
to observe your abilities.

554
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,882
This just shows how much power
and influence the Sharingan holds.

555
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,915
I want you to be aware of that.

556
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:15,227
It brings joy to the clan when
one of its own excels.

557
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:18,230
Of course, I'm very proud of you too.

558
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,074
<i>He died…</i>

559
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:29,575
<i>Father.</i>

560
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:34,564
But, do not rest on your laurels just
because you have the Sharingan now.

561
00:39:35,322 --> 00:39:38,808
In order to sharpen the power in your
eyes, you must continue to be diligent.

562
00:39:40,022 --> 00:39:42,608
Well, I don't need to lecture you.

563
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,549
You are my son, after all.

564
00:39:47,659 --> 00:39:49,578
<i>My friend died…</i>

565
00:39:50,014 --> 00:39:52,475
<i>But, Father is…</i>

566
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,017
Yes, Father.

567
00:39:55,354 --> 00:39:57,564
I will continue to be diligent.

568
00:39:58,604 --> 00:39:59,438
Good.

569
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,399
I'll be on my way now.

570
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:08,447
Big Brother!

571
00:40:08,557 --> 00:40:10,976
You said you'd play with me today!

572
00:40:13,151 --> 00:40:14,319
That's right, I did, didn't I?

573
00:40:15,415 --> 00:40:16,583
But I have a mission.

574
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:19,500
Forgive me, Sasuke. Next time.

575
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,045
Sorry about that, Sasuke.

576
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,923
I'm gonna borrow your brother
for a little bit.

577
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,764
Why did you lie?

578
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:38,352
Sasuke resents me now.

579
00:40:39,401 --> 00:40:41,355
I know that was wrong of me…

580
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:43,878
But Sasuke's a smart kid…

581
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:45,751
I think he'll understand.

582
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,867
"First, have one genin
accompany you,

583
00:40:47,892 --> 00:40:49,911
and secure the scroll in question."

584
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:56,425
Even if my training exercise required
a genin, it really didn't have to be you.

585
00:40:56,904 --> 00:40:58,823
Don't say that now!

586
00:40:59,303 --> 00:41:01,180
Even if it's not a real mission,

587
00:41:01,205 --> 00:41:03,135
none other than Shisui the jonin
requested me.

588
00:41:03,507 --> 00:41:06,009
I'm not lying when
I say it's a mission, right?

589
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,243
Well, you're half right.

590
00:41:09,329 --> 00:41:10,330
Let's go.

591
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,600
What are the details of
the training exercise?

592
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:18,767
There are three parts.

593
00:41:21,528 --> 00:41:25,907
The first part is to find traces left
by a fugitive, and then to track him.

594
00:41:32,576 --> 00:41:33,577
Pretty good!

595
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,458
Let's start from here.

596
00:41:53,614 --> 00:41:55,054
<i>A footprint left on moss…</i>

597
00:41:55,631 --> 00:41:56,841
<i>As expected from Shisui…</i>

598
00:41:57,611 --> 00:41:59,905
<i>He doesn't miss the slightest details.</i>

599
00:42:12,888 --> 00:42:13,889
This is…

600
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,283
Our guy stepped on
a piece of a branch…

601
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,536
Very perceptive of you!

602
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:20,788
But, that's just a decoy.

603
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,619
Dry wood like that would snap
when stepped on…

604
00:42:24,644 --> 00:42:26,563
but this piece still has
a lot of moisture.

605
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:29,713
Also, see this clean cut?

606
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,091
Obviously, he was in a hurry
to make a decoy…

607
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:34,843
Sloppy work.

608
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,056
Don't be disappointed…

609
00:42:39,501 --> 00:42:41,836
An animal could have left
that indentation in the moss,

610
00:42:41,861 --> 00:42:43,654
but only humans make decoys.

611
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:45,854
And if he laid the decoy
over in that direction…

612
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:49,942
A stone?

613
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,026
Yes.

614
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,573
The underside is dry
and the top is damp.

615
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,159
Could this be a decoy too?

616
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:02,251
Well…That's very possible.

617
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:06,959
The moisture on the rock will tell us

618
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,712
how long ago he was here.

619
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,630
I see!

620
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:15,009
Judging from the dryness,
only a short while has passed.

621
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,180
This scent!

622
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:43,851
Perfect!

623
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:45,039
Let's go!

624
00:43:53,661 --> 00:43:55,872
I think a fish left that mark behind.

625
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:59,011
So it's not a decoy?

626
00:43:59,658 --> 00:44:02,786
No. That's the main purpose
of leaving decoys.

627
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,893
Everything starts to look
like them.

628
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:10,272
Confusing their pursuers gives
the fugitive many additional options.

629
00:44:10,787 --> 00:44:14,610
At this rate, there's no way
I can find the fugitive by myself.

630
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:16,987
I need to develop better
tracking skills.

631
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:22,785
You're half right.

632
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,086
Here.

633
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:33,420
Drink up.

634
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,304
It's because you're exceptional, Itachi…

635
00:44:46,008 --> 00:44:47,076
That's why…

636
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:50,646
I bet you've never tried to understand
the feelings of someone who's not.

637
00:44:52,164 --> 00:44:54,541
Having the skills to track
a fugitive is important,

638
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:57,110
but so is understanding
how he thinks.

639
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:59,869
If you can understand his mindset,

640
00:44:59,894 --> 00:45:02,733
sometimes you can thwart
a fugitive even without those skills.

641
00:45:04,237 --> 00:45:05,322
I see!

642
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:07,287
So…

643
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:11,709
Let's move on to the second part
of the training exercise.

644
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,251
The second part?

645
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:17,840
Yeah…

646
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,924
To encamp at night.

647
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:22,845
The textbook said campfires
are prohibited.

648
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,056
So does this mean there's another
reason behind doing this?

649
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:27,850
Just eat.

650
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:31,937
You're exceptional, Itachi.

651
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,367
I'm still inexperienced.

652
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:38,068
Earlier, if I had more skills…

653
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:40,718
That's true.

654
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,448
Don't laugh!

655
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,534
Sorry, sorry…
It just makes me happy.

656
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,411
"Happy"?

657
00:45:48,073 --> 00:45:49,221
Huh? No!

658
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:50,664
Just listen…

659
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:55,085
I thought that there was really nothing
I could teach you.

660
00:45:56,411 --> 00:45:57,412
But…

661
00:45:57,437 --> 00:45:59,230
You taught me a lot today.

662
00:45:59,581 --> 00:46:02,292
Yeah...And that's what
made me happy.

663
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:05,929
So…

664
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:06,930
Hmm?

665
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:08,015
What about this campfire?

666
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:09,391
Oh…

667
00:46:10,238 --> 00:46:13,367
It's nice to share a meal with
someone you feel at ease with.

668
00:46:14,775 --> 00:46:19,571
Enjoying a hot meal helps
cheer you up.

669
00:46:20,669 --> 00:46:22,629
Eat it while it's hot.

670
00:46:27,817 --> 00:46:29,903
Yeah...It's warm and tasty!

671
00:46:30,237 --> 00:46:31,238
Told you so!

672
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:34,082
<i>But…</i>

673
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,752
<i>If I'm really exceptional…</i>

674
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:39,855
<i>He wouldn't have died.</i>

675
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:43,300
<i>I'm still so inexperienced.</i>

676
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:45,980
So why would someone like me…

677
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,431
I…

678
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:50,015
Hmm?

679
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,392
Awakened the Sharingan…

680
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,311
I see…

681
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,440
Is that why…you lied?

682
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:00,442
"Lied"?

683
00:47:00,801 --> 00:47:03,062
You said the same thing
at the start of practice.

684
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:06,448
You're good at fooling yourself.

685
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:10,199
That's why you can't grasp
your true feelings.

686
00:47:12,779 --> 00:47:14,578
You didn't want to stay
at home, right?

687
00:47:15,671 --> 00:47:17,131
That's the look you had
on your face.

688
00:47:25,678 --> 00:47:26,929
That might be true…

689
00:47:28,228 --> 00:47:31,148
<i>Shisui picked up on how
I felt from the very beginning…</i>

690
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:35,394
I'll be happy to listen any time
you want to talk.

691
00:47:43,774 --> 00:47:46,068
The final part of the training
exercise is about to start.

692
00:47:58,372 --> 00:48:00,082
I'll assist you to the best
of my abilities!

693
00:48:03,415 --> 00:48:04,416
The pursuers are ANBU?!

694
00:48:04,744 --> 00:48:05,954
Is this an exercise?

695
00:48:06,286 --> 00:48:07,287
No…

696
00:48:07,312 --> 00:48:08,981
Put that out of your mind for now.

697
00:48:09,999 --> 00:48:12,210
Why are you attacking
a fellow Leaf shinobi?

698
00:48:12,627 --> 00:48:15,797
Would you consider forgetting that
you saw this and leaving?

699
00:48:16,388 --> 00:48:18,474
If you're going to kill a comrade,

700
00:48:18,717 --> 00:48:21,344
I can't look the other way
without hearing a reason!

701
00:48:21,678 --> 00:48:22,679
The truth is…

702
00:48:23,288 --> 00:48:25,498
We're going after those
who betrayed the village.

703
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,412
Where's the proof that
he betrayed you?

704
00:48:29,227 --> 00:48:30,562
What a waste of time.

705
00:48:30,854 --> 00:48:32,480
Let's just kill them all.

706
00:48:32,522 --> 00:48:33,523
Just wait…

707
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:36,664
It's not that he's a traitor.

708
00:48:37,322 --> 00:48:40,909
But he has evidence that proves
who the traitor is in that scroll.

709
00:48:41,778 --> 00:48:44,906
If he hands it over, we will disappear.

710
00:48:45,452 --> 00:48:46,661
So she says…

711
00:48:48,601 --> 00:48:51,146
You want the intel…
but for what purpose?

712
00:48:51,442 --> 00:48:52,735
Isn't it obvious?!

713
00:48:53,172 --> 00:48:55,800
Anyone who threatens the village
will be punished…

714
00:48:56,454 --> 00:49:00,416
We maintain the order in Leaf Village
with our code of darkness!

715
00:49:01,009 --> 00:49:03,261
You don't have the right to judge!

716
00:49:03,762 --> 00:49:05,889
I will hand this secret missive
to Lord Hokage…

717
00:49:06,806 --> 00:49:09,893
Lord Hokage will make
a fair and just judgment!

718
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:12,312
"A fair and just judgment"?

719
00:49:12,711 --> 00:49:14,382
How naïve.

720
00:49:15,023 --> 00:49:17,650
You betray the village, you die.
That's that.

721
00:49:17,776 --> 00:49:19,903
Even a traitor has
a reason behind their actions!

722
00:49:20,507 --> 00:49:24,052
The Hokage's wish is
to investigate that carefully.

723
00:49:24,627 --> 00:49:26,379
<i>That's one way of thinking.</i>

724
00:49:26,865 --> 00:49:27,658
<i>However…</i>

725
00:49:27,786 --> 00:49:29,954
<i>This involves the entire village.</i>

726
00:49:30,199 --> 00:49:33,286
<i>The gravity of one traitor versus
one village is far too great.</i>

727
00:49:33,944 --> 00:49:34,945
<i>What would Shisui…?</i>

728
00:49:39,923 --> 00:49:41,966
He took the opportunity to
substitute himself out

729
00:49:42,008 --> 00:49:43,343
while we were "advising" him…

730
00:49:43,478 --> 00:49:44,479
Don't worry.

731
00:49:44,864 --> 00:49:47,325
My wire is coated with poison.

732
00:49:48,181 --> 00:49:50,058
His body will go numb and
he won't go far.

733
00:49:50,384 --> 00:49:53,262
Without words, they carry out
their purpose with blades…

734
00:49:54,138 --> 00:49:55,431
Leave it to the ANBU…

735
00:49:56,145 --> 00:49:58,439
Or rather, Lord Danzo's Foundation, right?

736
00:49:59,326 --> 00:50:01,620
Nameless individuals who maintain
peace from the shadows…

737
00:50:02,397 --> 00:50:04,316
I believe that is a true shinobi.

738
00:50:05,022 --> 00:50:07,233
Then you share our beliefs.

739
00:50:07,535 --> 00:50:08,536
No, you're wrong!

740
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:12,533
Order maintained through
the power of the blade…

741
00:50:14,366 --> 00:50:15,701
…is not peace!

742
00:50:18,127 --> 00:50:19,128
I…

743
00:50:19,314 --> 00:50:21,400
Itachi…stay out of this!

744
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,658
I am Itachi Uchiha!

745
00:50:24,045 --> 00:50:25,421
I will fight alongside Shisui!

746
00:50:26,261 --> 00:50:27,262
Itachi!

747
00:50:38,944 --> 00:50:40,695
<i>So this is the how the ANBU fight.</i>

748
00:50:41,609 --> 00:50:45,071
The Uchiha would dare to
push their luck and defy us?

749
00:50:45,864 --> 00:50:47,907
We will not show mercy,
even to children.

750
00:50:49,862 --> 00:50:52,239
At least make it fun for us!

751
00:51:04,257 --> 00:51:06,968
The one your friend is fighting,

752
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:09,596
is a kunoichi who's unrivaled
within the Foundation.

753
00:51:10,138 --> 00:51:11,806
If you don't stop him quickly,
he will die.

754
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:13,433
Retreat!

755
00:51:13,808 --> 00:51:15,393
Don't underestimate the Uchiha!

756
00:51:15,555 --> 00:51:17,974
Besides…he's exceptional!

757
00:51:30,783 --> 00:51:32,243
<i>Sharingan!</i>

758
00:51:45,673 --> 00:51:48,635
<i>She keeps mixing it up
with double and triple layers.</i>

759
00:51:49,093 --> 00:51:50,094
<i>But…!</i>

760
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:54,849
<i>I thought he was just a child,
but he has the Sharingan already?</i>

761
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:13,451
<i>I can see it!</i>

762
00:52:14,318 --> 00:52:16,862
<i>So this is the power of the Sharingan!</i>

763
00:52:22,354 --> 00:52:24,523
There's no right way or
wrong way to fight in a battle.

764
00:52:25,458 --> 00:52:26,125
But…

765
00:52:26,215 --> 00:52:29,385
I've already seen
through your attacks.

766
00:52:30,635 --> 00:52:32,387
I don't think so…

767
00:52:33,137 --> 00:52:36,307
You have already fallen into my trap.

768
00:52:38,059 --> 00:52:40,269
You're pretty good,
even though you're a child.

769
00:52:51,264 --> 00:52:53,016
What--? How?!

770
00:52:53,858 --> 00:52:54,900
I told you…

771
00:52:55,365 --> 00:52:57,117
I've seen through your attacks.

772
00:52:57,682 --> 00:52:59,851
That threaded ninja tool you threw…

773
00:53:00,214 --> 00:53:02,299
I changed its trajectory
just a little bit.

774
00:53:03,668 --> 00:53:05,586
You…damn Uchiha!

775
00:53:11,467 --> 00:53:13,302
Itachi seems to be doing fine.

776
00:53:13,429 --> 00:53:15,347
So I'll end things on my end!

777
00:53:18,244 --> 00:53:19,495
<i>Teleportation Jutsu!</i>

778
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:23,722
Shadow Clones…

779
00:53:24,144 --> 00:53:26,146
No, they're just Afterimage Clones.

780
00:53:26,733 --> 00:53:30,611
If they're just afterimages,
I'll sense out the real one…

781
00:53:31,324 --> 00:53:32,909
What…? This is weird.

782
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:34,542
I can't see the real one!

783
00:53:44,491 --> 00:53:45,492
Get the hell outta here!

784
00:53:51,239 --> 00:53:52,490
<i>He didn't fly off!</i>

785
00:53:52,518 --> 00:53:56,230
<i>Namely…he has no mass.
But his attack is powerful…</i>

786
00:53:56,429 --> 00:53:57,889
<i>What's going on?</i>

787
00:53:58,772 --> 00:54:01,316
My Teleportation Jutsu has no mass.

788
00:54:01,601 --> 00:54:04,645
But you could say everything has mass.

789
00:54:07,409 --> 00:54:10,329
It seems the jonin observing
our training exercise have noticed.

790
00:54:14,075 --> 00:54:16,620
We will be watching you
from the shadows…

791
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:20,765
Shisui Uchiha...Itachi Uchiha!

792
00:54:29,443 --> 00:54:30,319
This is…!

793
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:32,936
It's not a fatal wound.
Don't worry about it.

794
00:54:36,552 --> 00:54:40,014
Back then…if I had observed
the enemy more carefully…

795
00:54:40,515 --> 00:54:41,516
Never mind that…

796
00:54:42,343 --> 00:54:45,449
He wants us to forget
this incident ever happened.

797
00:54:46,067 --> 00:54:47,902
His life was threatened! So why?

798
00:54:48,616 --> 00:54:50,868
If this incident becomes known,

799
00:54:51,025 --> 00:54:53,402
it will sow the seeds
for a new conflict.

800
00:54:53,754 --> 00:54:55,797
This is not what Lord Hokage wants.

801
00:54:56,984 --> 00:55:00,953
<i>The ones who aid peace from
the shadows are also…nameless.</i>

802
00:55:02,467 --> 00:55:06,871
So there was fighting, but you assumed
it was part of the training exercise?

803
00:55:07,741 --> 00:55:08,826
I'm sorry.

804
00:55:09,042 --> 00:55:10,835
They were extremely strong,

805
00:55:11,271 --> 00:55:14,507
and I was doing my best to protect
the genin, so I didn't see their faces…

806
00:55:14,708 --> 00:55:19,296
No, we're at fault for not catching
their infiltration too.

807
00:55:19,967 --> 00:55:21,526
I'm glad neither of you are hurt.

808
00:55:23,959 --> 00:55:26,629
I'd like to talk to you more
about this tomorrow.

809
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:29,517
But this training exercise is over.

810
00:55:30,914 --> 00:55:32,499
Itachi, let's go home.

811
00:55:35,778 --> 00:55:36,779
What's the matter?

812
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:41,777
Ah...You sprained your ankle.

813
00:55:41,993 --> 00:55:43,536
You're making a big deal
out of nothing.

814
00:55:44,566 --> 00:55:46,943
When you first awaken
the Sharingan,

815
00:55:47,128 --> 00:55:49,005
sometimes there's a "slight gap"

816
00:55:49,185 --> 00:55:52,021
between the image your brain foresees
and your body's reaction time.

817
00:55:53,195 --> 00:55:57,074
And when you try too hard to
compensate for that slight gap…

818
00:55:57,868 --> 00:55:58,869
this happens.

819
00:55:59,343 --> 00:56:01,470
I said you're making
a big deal out of nothing.

820
00:56:02,071 --> 00:56:02,572
Oww!

821
00:56:03,431 --> 00:56:05,349
No matter how exceptional
you are, Itachi…

822
00:56:05,349 --> 00:56:07,476
don't overdo it.

823
00:56:14,549 --> 00:56:16,176
It's not funny!

824
00:56:16,492 --> 00:56:17,493
I'm sorry!

825
00:56:17,965 --> 00:56:19,050
I'm just happy.

826
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:22,588
You're really like
a kid brother to me.

827
00:56:24,257 --> 00:56:28,094
So being able to take you under
my wing like this makes me happy.

828
00:56:29,624 --> 00:56:33,502
I want you to think of me as your older
brother and depend on me for anything.

829
00:56:35,589 --> 00:56:36,590
Shisui…

830
00:56:36,797 --> 00:56:37,465
Hmm?

831
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:39,133
About the ANBU…

832
00:56:39,441 --> 00:56:40,260
Oh…

833
00:56:40,285 --> 00:56:41,912
Did I make the right decision?

834
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:43,416
I won't say yes.

835
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:48,184
I don't even know if there is such a
thing as justice in the shinobi world.

836
00:56:48,209 --> 00:56:49,210
But that's…!

837
00:56:49,685 --> 00:56:52,188
We fight believing in our own justice.

838
00:56:52,855 --> 00:56:56,567
But if the enemy is doing
the same thing, who's right?

839
00:56:57,258 --> 00:56:59,344
You realized that during
today's exercise, didn't you?

840
00:56:59,654 --> 00:57:01,739
There's more than
one side to an issue.

841
00:57:02,215 --> 00:57:04,425
You must consider things
from various viewpoints.

842
00:57:05,012 --> 00:57:07,222
"Various…viewpoints"?

843
00:57:08,654 --> 00:57:10,656
You must be tired from
using your Sharingan.

844
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:13,280
Go ahead and sleep.

845
00:57:15,202 --> 00:57:17,746
But there's one thing that's certain…

846
00:57:18,965 --> 00:57:21,425
I will never, ever betray you.

847
00:57:23,598 --> 00:57:25,016
<i>That's the one thing
that's certain.</i>

848
00:57:33,854 --> 00:57:34,981
<i>So it's come to this.</i>

849
00:57:36,107 --> 00:57:37,108
<i>Shisui…</i>

850
00:57:37,525 --> 00:57:38,567
<i>I'm…</i>

851
00:57:45,822 --> 00:57:49,534
I'm Itachi Uchiha.
I'll be part of ANBU from today.

852
00:57:50,371 --> 00:57:51,956
I'm looking forward
to working with you.

853
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:58,045
<i>I'm going to watch over the Hidden Leaf
from within the shadows.</i>

854
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:06,247
A new member will be
joining your team.

855
00:58:06,392 --> 00:58:07,851
Is it the one
we previously discussed?

856
00:58:08,236 --> 00:58:10,905
Yes, he's extremely capable.

857
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:13,529
But he's young.

858
00:58:14,263 --> 00:58:17,850
Danzo recommended that
he gain more experience.

859
00:58:19,595 --> 00:58:21,513
Some of you may be aware,

860
00:58:22,371 --> 00:58:24,790
but my son Itachi has
joined the ANBU.

861
00:58:25,948 --> 00:58:28,330
Being in close vicinity to
the Hokage and the top ranks

862
00:58:28,355 --> 00:58:30,829
means access to more information.

863
00:58:31,364 --> 00:58:35,243
And that is a boon
for the Uchiha Clan.

864
00:58:36,301 --> 00:58:39,095
Itachi, do you have
anything to report?

865
00:58:39,765 --> 00:58:40,626
Well...

866
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:46,773
I'm still new,
so there's not much to report.

867
00:58:47,393 --> 00:58:49,061
However, I don't think
there's solidarity

868
00:58:49,086 --> 00:58:51,505
in the higher ranks of the Leaf.

869
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:55,616
It's my belief that how
the Uchiha Clan deals with this

870
00:58:56,267 --> 00:58:59,396
will determine the future
of the Hidden Leaf.

871
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:03,081
Exactly. By all rights,

872
00:59:03,398 --> 00:59:06,193
the Uchiha Clan must be involved
in the future of the Hidden Leaf.

873
00:59:06,403 --> 00:59:09,517
- That's right!
- Right!

874
00:59:09,542 --> 00:59:13,171
- Yeah!
- Yes, that's right!

875
00:59:18,158 --> 00:59:19,288
<i>That's the...</i>

876
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:24,936
Time to switch.

877
00:59:26,013 --> 00:59:27,180
Nothing to report.

878
00:59:27,205 --> 00:59:28,164
This is...

879
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:30,400
This isn't the only
surveillance center around.

880
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:32,986
Lord Danzo's ANBU are
also watching them.

881
00:59:33,465 --> 00:59:34,484
Now what'll you do?

882
00:59:34,735 --> 00:59:37,154
Notify your clan about this?

883
00:59:37,764 --> 00:59:39,474
What is my job here?

884
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:42,120
Just keep watching through that.

885
00:59:43,499 --> 00:59:46,001
Okay, Captain. We're going.

886
00:59:46,575 --> 00:59:48,577
Stay alert, Itachi.

887
00:59:51,711 --> 00:59:53,526
This is part of our job as ANBU.

888
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:55,718
It's not assassination

889
00:59:56,071 --> 00:59:58,615
but it's still dirty work.

890
00:59:59,064 --> 01:00:00,399
A mission is a mission.

891
01:00:00,787 --> 01:00:05,222
You'll be spying on your friends
and family. It's even dirtier.

892
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:07,645
I can take this shift,
if you want.

893
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:10,315
No, that's not necessary.
Besides...

894
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:11,774
Besides?

895
01:00:12,972 --> 01:00:17,807
The Uchiha Clan is aware
that they're under suspicion.

896
01:00:19,276 --> 01:00:20,559
I guess you would be.

897
01:00:31,746 --> 01:00:32,581
Calm down!

898
01:00:32,606 --> 01:00:34,316
A genjutsu!
But when did that happen?

899
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:39,761
<i>Byakugan!</i>

900
01:00:50,227 --> 01:00:51,228
We're retreating!

901
01:00:51,361 --> 01:00:52,404
But Captain...!

902
01:00:52,964 --> 01:00:56,300
It's Shisui Uchiha,
the Teleporter of the Leaf.

903
01:00:56,663 --> 01:00:59,541
We're no match for him. Retreat!

904
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:06,412
That should keep the Hidden Mist
quiet for a while.

905
01:01:08,947 --> 01:01:11,834
Team Shisui has returned and
our mission was successfully completed.

906
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:16,047
That was a long mission.
Thank you for your hard work.

907
01:01:16,501 --> 01:01:18,670
Go and rest.

908
01:01:18,903 --> 01:01:21,155
I have a request, Lord Third.

909
01:01:28,923 --> 01:01:32,843
I'm very troubled by the suspicion
cast upon the Uchiha Clan.

910
01:01:33,675 --> 01:01:34,968
So am I.

911
01:01:35,693 --> 01:01:40,202
I'm hoping that my clan and the Village
will be able to trust each other again.

912
01:01:40,859 --> 01:01:43,069
Will you assign this mission to me?

913
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:47,688
Do you want to be released
from your regular duties?

914
01:01:48,068 --> 01:01:52,030
Yes. And I'd like to be given
a certain amount of authority.

915
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:59,674
All right. Let's say I ordered you on
a top-secret investigative mission.

916
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:03,886
If anyone objects, tell them my name,

917
01:02:04,194 --> 01:02:06,806
and I will take full responsibility.

918
01:02:07,255 --> 01:02:08,280
Thank you.

919
01:02:08,865 --> 01:02:14,556
You remind me so much
of my old friend, Kagami Uchiha.

920
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:16,941
I am nowhere near his caliber.

921
01:02:25,882 --> 01:02:26,750
Big Brother!

922
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:28,995
Are you done with your mission?

923
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:31,539
If you are, help me train!

924
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:34,792
Sorry, Sasuke.
I have an urgent summons.

925
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:48,097
We played here a lot.

926
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:49,766
So you were back.

927
01:02:50,171 --> 01:02:53,174
Yeah. We finally chased
the Hidden Mist away.

928
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,565
Why did you want to see me?

929
01:02:56,459 --> 01:02:58,569
I want to hear
your honest opinion.

930
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,377
How serious do you think Fugaku is?

931
01:03:01,898 --> 01:03:03,024
What do you mean by serious?

932
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:05,782
A coup d'état.

933
01:03:07,166 --> 01:03:10,169
Dissatisfaction towards the Village
is growing among the Uchiha.

934
01:03:10,866 --> 01:03:14,662
If the Village doesn't change,
the Uchiha won't stand for it anymore.

935
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:18,503
If the Village changes,
so will the Uchiha.

936
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:21,214
But if the Uchiha doesn't change,
neither will the Village.

937
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:24,300
As long as the two sides
distrust each other,

938
01:03:24,693 --> 01:03:26,486
things will only get worse.

939
01:03:27,941 --> 01:03:29,901
I want to clear up that suspicion.

940
01:03:30,338 --> 01:03:31,715
You think you can?

941
01:03:31,907 --> 01:03:33,784
I don't know, but I have to try...

942
01:03:34,864 --> 01:03:39,646
If the Uchiha attempts a coup d'état,
it will bode badly for both sides.

943
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:43,694
I'm against a coup d'état as well.

944
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:46,781
But it will take something big
to stop it.

945
01:03:47,117 --> 01:03:50,412
I know.
But you shouldn't do anything.

946
01:03:50,633 --> 01:03:51,801
Why's that?

947
01:03:52,044 --> 01:03:54,880
Some members on the Police Force
are suspicious of you...

948
01:03:55,712 --> 01:03:57,881
and I've been ordered
to spy on you.

949
01:04:04,594 --> 01:04:05,595
What?!

950
01:04:05,788 --> 01:04:07,999
Do you know what day tomorrow is?!

951
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:11,180
You don't understand
your own position!

952
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:14,642
I'm setting out on
a mission tomorrow.

953
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:16,352
What kind of mission?

954
01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:19,879
I can't tell you...
It's top-secret.

955
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:24,216
Itachi...

956
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:28,489
You also serve as the Uchiha Clan's
pipeline to the Village nerve center.

957
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:31,409
You know that, don't you?

958
01:04:32,785 --> 01:04:33,786
Yes...

959
01:04:34,163 --> 01:04:36,373
Bear that in mind.

960
01:04:36,858 --> 01:04:39,152
And come to tomorrow's assembly!

961
01:04:43,334 --> 01:04:46,754
The Uchiha are assembling
again tonight.

962
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:49,260
I know about it as well.

963
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:54,348
But we cannot interfere
with their clan rituals.

964
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:55,850
Rituals indeed!

965
01:04:55,892 --> 01:05:02,732
They're going to fan the flames of distrust
against us, then use it to unite the clan.

966
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:05,568
They are preparing for a coup d'état.

967
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,654
And the one to nip it
in the bud is...

968
01:05:08,946 --> 01:05:10,031
Shisui!

969
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,409
Shisui Uchiha?

970
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,120
Shisui will attend the assembly.

971
01:05:16,427 --> 01:05:21,459
And if Fugaku Uchiha incites
a rebellion...

972
01:05:21,690 --> 01:05:23,442
I will use my Kotoamatsukami.

973
01:05:24,151 --> 01:05:25,736
Your visual jutsu...

974
01:05:26,054 --> 01:05:29,679
He will have no clue that Shisui
is controlling his actions.

975
01:05:29,704 --> 01:05:32,165
He will believe that
his words are his own.

976
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:35,520
I'm going to make Fugaku think
about co-existence with the Village.

977
01:05:35,701 --> 01:05:37,995
I don't think that
controlling only Fugaku

978
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:40,703
will put an end to
the Uchiha's dissatisfaction.

979
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:45,358
No. If the Uchiha will change,
then we of the Leaf must change too.

980
01:05:45,947 --> 01:05:48,658
Let us improve our relations
with the Uchiha.

981
01:05:48,986 --> 01:05:50,404
That is my hope.

982
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:53,766
I will assign one ANBU
behind the scenes.

983
01:05:54,714 --> 01:05:56,383
I'm counting on you, Shisui.

984
01:05:56,566 --> 01:05:57,316
Yes, sir!

985
01:06:04,876 --> 01:06:06,966
Itachi isn't coming, is he?

986
01:06:14,845 --> 01:06:15,983
<i>He's late.</i>

987
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:19,684
What is it, Lord Danzo?

988
01:06:20,151 --> 01:06:22,131
It's almost time for
the assembly to start.

989
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:27,108
Even if you use your visual jutsu
on Fugaku to get the clan to cooperate,

990
01:06:27,377 --> 01:06:29,671
what if the Village doesn't change?

991
01:06:30,294 --> 01:06:33,214
Lord Hokage has promised
to make it change.

992
01:06:33,891 --> 01:06:35,977
Even if Lord Third is satisfied,

993
01:06:36,056 --> 01:06:39,226
the distrust among
the Leaf will not go away.

994
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:42,739
I realize that. But in time...

995
01:06:42,764 --> 01:06:49,062
Besides, someone who's always suspicious
like me will never change.

996
01:06:49,473 --> 01:06:50,933
What will you do then?

997
01:06:51,395 --> 01:06:52,854
But Lord Danzo...

998
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:54,677
When the time comes,

999
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:58,097
will you use your Kotoamatsukami
on me too?

1000
01:06:58,389 --> 01:06:59,306
I'm...

1001
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:02,101
Your Sharingan...
shall be in my safekeeping!

1002
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:03,144
Forgive me.

1003
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:09,228
It's only genjutsu...
You'll snap out of it shortly.

1004
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:29,587
Sharingan?!

1005
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:32,465
I'm going to take it
to replace this eye.

1006
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:35,301
Give me the other one too.

1007
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:38,115
<i>Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!</i>

1008
01:07:39,110 --> 01:07:40,945
<i>Water Style: Raging Waves!</i>

1009
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,688
It's a Teleportation Jutsu!

1010
01:07:47,713 --> 01:07:48,714
Go after him.

1011
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:55,738
Is that you, Shisui?

1012
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:57,198
Come with me.

1013
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:07,500
It's too late to stop
the coup d'état by the Uchiha.

1014
01:08:07,890 --> 01:08:09,949
If civil war breaks out
in the Leaf Village,

1015
01:08:09,974 --> 01:08:11,809
other nations are sure
to attack...

1016
01:08:12,235 --> 01:08:13,820
which means a full-scale war.

1017
01:08:14,286 --> 01:08:17,581
I was going to try to stop
the coup d'état with Kotoamatsukami, but...

1018
01:08:18,099 --> 01:08:20,101
Lord Danzo took my right eye...

1019
01:08:21,305 --> 01:08:23,265
He doesn't trust me.

1020
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:25,976
He intends to protect
the Village his own way,

1021
01:08:26,001 --> 01:08:27,753
no matter what it takes
or how it looks.

1022
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:30,272
I suspect he'll come after
my left eye as well.

1023
01:08:30,548 --> 01:08:33,103
So I want to give it to you
before he has a chance.

1024
01:08:34,205 --> 01:08:35,414
<i>Shisui.</i>

1025
01:08:36,611 --> 01:08:39,115
You're the only person I can count on,
my best friend.

1026
01:08:39,418 --> 01:08:43,383
Please protect this Village...
and the honor of the Uchiha name.

1027
01:09:01,846 --> 01:09:03,430
I accept it.

1028
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,349
What will you do now?

1029
01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:09,245
If I die, several circumstances
will change.

1030
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:10,855
I've left behind a note already...

1031
01:09:10,896 --> 01:09:12,148
Wait, Shisui!

1032
01:09:12,189 --> 01:09:13,440
Don't stop me, Itachi.

1033
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:21,448
If you're my friend...

1034
01:09:23,006 --> 01:09:24,298
Shisui!

1035
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:29,999
<i>Shisui...</i>

1036
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:36,297
Shisui Uchiha, who threw himself
into the Nakano River

1037
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:38,048
and killed himself last night…

1038
01:09:41,335 --> 01:09:44,052
Why don't you come out and say it?

1039
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:46,640
You suspect me, don't you?

1040
01:09:47,524 --> 01:09:49,693
Yeah, we do, you punk.

1041
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:51,020
Listen, Itachi.

1042
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:53,355
Just try and betray the clan.

1043
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:55,107
And you'll pay big time.

1044
01:10:00,988 --> 01:10:02,865
The clan, the clan...

1045
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:07,184
You overestimate your own abilities,

1046
01:10:07,209 --> 01:10:09,169
and have no idea about
the depth of my own.

1047
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:11,290
That's why you're
groveling there now.

1048
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:12,374
Stop, Itachi!

1049
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:16,420
What is going on?

1050
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:17,421
Just wha—

1051
01:10:20,758 --> 01:10:22,176
There's no hope left…

1052
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:25,346
for this pathetic clan.

1053
01:10:25,512 --> 01:10:26,513
Brother!

1054
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:28,265
Please stop!

1055
01:10:35,689 --> 01:10:37,399
<i>Observe carefully with
those eyes...</i>

1056
01:10:37,524 --> 01:10:38,525
<i>Sasuke.</i>

1057
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:43,072
<i>Observe how shallow this clan is.</i>

1058
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:21,735
That's the Lightning Blade!

1059
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:25,114
You're...the Copy Ninja of the Leaf!

1060
01:11:26,573 --> 01:11:29,201
Kaka...shi...

1061
01:11:31,097 --> 01:11:33,934
You've become quite well known.

1062
01:11:35,122 --> 01:11:37,332
Do it long enough and
you're bound to become famous.

1063
01:11:37,584 --> 01:11:38,752
Clear the area.

1064
01:11:39,050 --> 01:11:41,130
Leave no trace of the Hidden Leaf.

1065
01:11:41,588 --> 01:11:43,465
Yeah, yeah. I know.

1066
01:11:44,304 --> 01:11:47,932
Dirty work is part of
the ANBU's modus operandi.

1067
01:11:54,003 --> 01:11:57,381
You said that a friend gave
your Sharingan to you.

1068
01:11:57,938 --> 01:11:59,815
Along with a wish.

1069
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:03,110
Do you need to honor that wish?

1070
01:12:03,829 --> 01:12:06,123
Yes, I intend to.

1071
01:12:09,616 --> 01:12:12,036
I know about
the Shisui Uchiha incident.

1072
01:12:12,369 --> 01:12:13,579
Is it about that?

1073
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:15,122
No, I'm fine.

1074
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:16,874
I see...

1075
01:12:17,249 --> 01:12:21,253
Anyway, there's not a lot I can do,
but let me know if there's anything.

1076
01:12:21,545 --> 01:12:22,546
Yes.

1077
01:12:29,268 --> 01:12:31,972
<i>You're the only person I can count on,
my best friend.</i>

1078
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:36,560
<i>Please protect this Village...
and the honor of the Uchiha name.</i>

1079
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:39,146
<i>Shisui.</i>

1080
01:12:39,435 --> 01:12:42,002
<i>Things have gotten much worse
since then.</i>

1081
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,961
<i>I don't think
I can protect everyone.</i>

1082
01:12:47,594 --> 01:12:50,430
Oww! What are you accusing me of?!

1083
01:12:50,681 --> 01:12:52,099
Just be quiet!

1084
01:12:52,427 --> 01:12:54,078
Don't be so rough.

1085
01:12:54,328 --> 01:12:55,329
Captain...

1086
01:12:55,662 --> 01:12:57,664
You are a suspect...

1087
01:12:58,104 --> 01:12:59,875
and you're coming to
Headquarters with us.

1088
01:13:00,145 --> 01:13:01,563
F-Fine...

1089
01:13:01,896 --> 01:13:04,398
Remember to follow
our investigative procedures!

1090
01:13:04,423 --> 01:13:05,507
Yes, sir!

1091
01:13:05,672 --> 01:13:06,882
C'mon, move.

1092
01:13:09,843 --> 01:13:13,931
Shisui Uchiha was a core member
of the Uchiha.

1093
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:19,395
His suicide demoralized and
lessened their fighting power all at once.

1094
01:13:20,312 --> 01:13:23,357
So the coup d'état has been foiled.

1095
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:29,446
Are you saying there was no other
way but for Shisui to give his life?

1096
01:13:29,922 --> 01:13:32,508
I shouldn't have pushed him...

1097
01:13:32,942 --> 01:13:34,652
There are a few among the Uchiha

1098
01:13:34,885 --> 01:13:38,833
who believe that you killed Shisui.

1099
01:13:39,593 --> 01:13:43,116
The ones who believe that
did not know

1100
01:13:43,554 --> 01:13:46,004
that Shisui and I were working
towards the same goal.

1101
01:13:46,416 --> 01:13:48,960
Shisui did not appear at
our rendezvous point.

1102
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:53,262
He had secrets,
so he was suspected.

1103
01:13:53,785 --> 01:13:56,538
I will notify the ANBU that
it was officially a suicide.

1104
01:13:57,182 --> 01:13:58,559
Agreed, Hiruzen?

1105
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:05,816
From today, you are now
an ANBU squad leader.

1106
01:14:06,828 --> 01:14:08,789
It's not the Foundation,

1107
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:11,488
but mission orders
will come from me…

1108
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:15,175
There is no need to report this
to Hiruzen and his staff.

1109
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:16,347
Yes.

1110
01:14:16,698 --> 01:14:19,117
Without further pause,
I have a mission for you.

1111
01:14:19,691 --> 01:14:22,068
It's a simple assassination.

1112
01:14:23,834 --> 01:14:25,711
The two behind you will assist you.

1113
01:14:26,336 --> 01:14:28,172
We are your subordinates from today.

1114
01:14:28,714 --> 01:14:30,257
We're honored to be of service.

1115
01:14:47,383 --> 01:14:48,384
Good work…

1116
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:50,068
By the way...

1117
01:14:50,652 --> 01:14:52,179
While you were away,

1118
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:54,781
the surveillance team that is
covering the Uchiha reported that

1119
01:14:54,781 --> 01:14:58,911
the Leaf Police is strengthening
their armaments.

1120
01:14:59,798 --> 01:15:02,050
What does this signify?

1121
01:15:02,623 --> 01:15:06,835
Resentment towards the Village has
been increasing among the Uchiha.

1122
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:09,880
So we can't ignore it?

1123
01:15:11,488 --> 01:15:12,489
No.

1124
01:15:38,225 --> 01:15:39,409
Welcome home, Big Brother!

1125
01:15:40,702 --> 01:15:42,538
I'm going to go train.

1126
01:15:42,708 --> 01:15:43,998
Come with me.

1127
01:15:44,518 --> 01:15:46,228
I'm exhausted from my mission.

1128
01:15:47,003 --> 01:15:49,380
You never get tired, Big Brother.

1129
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:51,213
Ouch!

1130
01:15:55,708 --> 01:15:58,545
Forgive me, Sasuke.
Maybe some other time.

1131
01:15:58,971 --> 01:15:59,972
Man!

1132
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:14,152
You know about the clan meeting
in three days, right?

1133
01:16:15,559 --> 01:16:16,363
No.

1134
01:16:16,947 --> 01:16:20,617
Come alone to the Nakano Shrine
after the meeting.

1135
01:16:21,285 --> 01:16:22,703
Without your ANBU subordinates.

1136
01:16:23,432 --> 01:16:26,310
I'll be leaving tomorrow on
a mission away from the Village.

1137
01:16:27,457 --> 01:16:28,458
Don't run away.

1138
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:30,669
"Run away"?

1139
01:16:31,336 --> 01:16:32,337
From what?

1140
01:16:33,338 --> 01:16:35,716
From your Uchiha destiny…

1141
01:16:43,070 --> 01:16:44,603
Isn't Itachi coming?

1142
01:16:45,197 --> 01:16:46,449
He's on a mission.

1143
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:53,945
The Uchiha Clan…

1144
01:16:54,789 --> 01:16:56,988
is intent on revolting against
the Hidden Leaf.

1145
01:16:58,488 --> 01:17:00,449
There's no time to waste.

1146
01:17:00,802 --> 01:17:04,640
We must strike preemptively
before them.

1147
01:17:04,913 --> 01:17:07,332
The Uchiha were our comrades
in arms in past wars…

1148
01:17:07,504 --> 01:17:10,423
I would like to use words
before violence.

1149
01:17:10,818 --> 01:17:12,945
I will come up with a way.

1150
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:17,674
Despite what Lord Third said…
when push comes to shove…

1151
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:20,177
He will do what whatever it takes
to protect the Hidden Leaf.

1152
01:17:20,552 --> 01:17:22,262
I want you to choose.

1153
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:25,182
Align with the Uchiha and
launch the coup d'état,

1154
01:17:25,182 --> 01:17:27,309
and be slaughtered
along with your family…

1155
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:29,311
Or side with the Leaf,

1156
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:32,689
and before they attempt a coup
d'état, eliminate every Uchiha?

1157
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:35,067
<i>Eliminate the Uchiha…</i>

1158
01:17:35,108 --> 01:17:36,568
In order to protect the Leaf,

1159
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:40,656
every possible step must
be taken to avoid mayhem.

1160
01:17:40,947 --> 01:17:43,418
The only one that can
handle this mission is you,

1161
01:17:43,443 --> 01:17:45,737
a double agent for both
the Uchiha and the Leaf.

1162
01:17:45,762 --> 01:17:49,122
There is no one else, Itachi.

1163
01:17:49,471 --> 01:17:51,890
Will you accept this mission?

1164
01:17:56,797 --> 01:18:00,217
<i>The Village…the clan…shinobi…</i>

1165
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:03,929
<i>Is fighting…inevitable?</i>

1166
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:07,724
<i>The Village or the clan…</i>

1167
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:13,438
<i>What should I do?</i>

1168
01:18:20,987 --> 01:18:23,365
I wasn't serious just now.

1169
01:18:23,407 --> 01:18:25,409
Yes, you were, loser.

1170
01:18:25,570 --> 01:18:28,365
If I were serious,
I would have beaten you!

1171
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:30,622
This time, I challenge you
to the high jump!

1172
01:18:30,664 --> 01:18:32,541
You're no match for me.

1173
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:34,042
What did you say?!

1174
01:18:49,516 --> 01:18:50,517
Hey…

1175
01:18:56,022 --> 01:18:58,650
There's something I would
like you to help me with.

1176
01:19:30,134 --> 01:19:31,135
Who are you?!

1177
01:20:03,484 --> 01:20:04,485
Oh...

1178
01:20:04,585 --> 01:20:05,669
Such fine eyes.

1179
01:20:07,427 --> 01:20:08,428
No way!

1180
01:20:14,441 --> 01:20:15,859
<i>Help…Itachi.</i>

1181
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:17,393
<i>Help me!</i>

1182
01:20:31,952 --> 01:20:32,953
Over here…

1183
01:20:34,018 --> 01:20:36,562
There are no traps.
Come inside.

1184
01:20:45,631 --> 01:20:46,632
Father!

1185
01:20:48,485 --> 01:20:51,654
I don't want to participate in
a death match…with my son.

1186
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:54,761
I see…

1187
01:20:55,144 --> 01:20:56,854
You've aligned with the other side.

1188
01:20:58,388 --> 01:21:00,140
Father, Mother…

1189
01:21:00,932 --> 01:21:01,933
I…

1190
01:21:02,745 --> 01:21:04,831
We already know, Itachi…

1191
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:08,225
Itachi, promise me this.

1192
01:21:10,694 --> 01:21:12,779
Take care of Sasuke.

1193
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:25,255
I will.

1194
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:30,566
Do not fear it.

1195
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:33,263
This is the path you've chosen.

1196
01:21:33,815 --> 01:21:37,319
Compared to yours,
our pain will end in an instant.

1197
01:21:38,643 --> 01:21:42,939
Our philosophies may differ,
but I'm proud of you.

1198
01:21:48,653 --> 01:21:51,448
You truly are a kind child.

1199
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:07,923
It's over.

1200
01:22:08,793 --> 01:22:10,056
You're…

1201
01:22:11,009 --> 01:22:12,636
Never mind. Shall we go?

1202
01:22:12,844 --> 01:22:14,249
Go on ahead.

1203
01:22:14,620 --> 01:22:16,830
I'm going to confirm things…
with the Leaf higher-ups.

1204
01:22:27,699 --> 01:22:29,242
This is horrible!

1205
01:22:29,537 --> 01:22:30,872
What the hell?

1206
01:22:33,470 --> 01:22:35,513
Rescue anyone who is still alive!

1207
01:22:37,182 --> 01:22:39,162
There's a survivor!

1208
01:22:39,663 --> 01:22:41,206
Take him to the Medical Unit!

1209
01:22:48,031 --> 01:22:49,699
Everyone else is dead.

1210
01:22:52,107 --> 01:22:54,067
Take away the corpses.

1211
01:22:54,439 --> 01:22:56,112
I mean, every single one.

1212
01:22:56,137 --> 01:22:58,014
Check inside the buildings as well.

1213
01:22:58,194 --> 01:23:01,729
Who could have done such a thing?

1214
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:04,187
Itachi Uchiha.

1215
01:23:04,785 --> 01:23:05,828
Itachi?!

1216
01:23:06,043 --> 01:23:09,798
Itachi Uchiha despised his clan.

1217
01:23:10,355 --> 01:23:13,880
That is why he killed Shisui
and took his eyes,

1218
01:23:14,135 --> 01:23:19,452
and caused in-fighting among
his brethren...and then finally...

1219
01:23:19,807 --> 01:23:21,748
He caused this atrocity.

1220
01:23:22,205 --> 01:23:24,499
But, why would he...?

1221
01:23:25,375 --> 01:23:28,003
Enough talking. Get to work!

1222
01:23:31,655 --> 01:23:33,991
This settles everything.

1223
01:23:34,175 --> 01:23:35,844
What does this settle?

1224
01:23:35,971 --> 01:23:40,518
Don't you see the huge problem
we're left with?!

1225
01:23:40,724 --> 01:23:42,267
I consider it very minor.

1226
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:47,564
Danzo, I cannot allow you to act
on your own authority any longer.

1227
01:23:48,106 --> 01:23:49,441
As of this moment,

1228
01:23:49,482 --> 01:23:51,466
you are relieved of your duties
as second in command.

1229
01:23:51,491 --> 01:23:53,486
But Hiruzen, I did it for...

1230
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:55,405
"The good of the Leaf"?

1231
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:58,158
Well then, the Uchiha Clan belonged
to the Hidden Leaf.

1232
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:01,411
Your ANBU and Foundation
will be dissolved!

1233
01:24:01,911 --> 01:24:04,456
I will deal with you later.

1234
01:24:04,967 --> 01:24:06,885
Until then,
you are confined to your quarters!

1235
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:14,024
Lord Danzo, the body count
doesn't match up.

1236
01:24:14,268 --> 01:24:15,477
What did you say?

1237
01:24:15,806 --> 01:24:18,058
It's like they just disappeared.

1238
01:24:20,712 --> 01:24:22,631
I witnessed everything.

1239
01:24:26,907 --> 01:24:28,909
And I will continue to watch.

1240
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:32,984
If you as much as touch Sasuke,

1241
01:24:33,102 --> 01:24:36,981
I will pass on classified Village intel
to every enemy nation.

1242
01:24:40,631 --> 01:24:42,383
Damn you...

1243
01:24:46,543 --> 01:24:51,002
If this is the scope of Itachi's hatred,
it ran very, very deep...

1244
01:24:51,219 --> 01:24:53,512
Just one survivor...

1245
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:55,090
Start taking them away.

1246
01:24:55,131 --> 01:24:56,132
Yes, sir.

1247
01:24:56,925 --> 01:24:59,135
What a mission, even for an ANBU.

1248
01:25:06,309 --> 01:25:08,019
First, you have my thanks.

1249
01:25:08,061 --> 01:25:11,022
Civil war has been averted
in the Hidden Leaf.

1250
01:25:11,285 --> 01:25:13,871
We have maintained peace.

1251
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:15,151
Yes.

1252
01:25:15,193 --> 01:25:20,532
However, I regret that there was
no other way to achieve this.

1253
01:25:20,865 --> 01:25:22,325
I apologize.

1254
01:25:22,867 --> 01:25:24,828
I'm the one who must apologize.

1255
01:25:25,984 --> 01:25:30,421
You will now be branded a Rogue
Ninja who massacred his entire clan,

1256
01:25:30,568 --> 01:25:33,863
and be listed in the Bingo Book
as a fugitive, wanted dead or alive.

1257
01:25:34,322 --> 01:25:35,449
That goes without saying.

1258
01:25:36,429 --> 01:25:37,847
What will you do from now?

1259
01:25:38,370 --> 01:25:40,831
I've found aid from a group
called the "Akatsuki."

1260
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:43,721
I intend to stay close to them

1261
01:25:43,995 --> 01:25:45,997
in order to make sure
a promise is not broken.

1262
01:25:52,316 --> 01:25:53,609
What do you want now?

1263
01:25:53,743 --> 01:25:56,746
You're a Rogue Ninja listed
in the Bingo Book, Captain.

1264
01:25:57,235 --> 01:25:58,611
An S-class, no less.

1265
01:25:58,736 --> 01:26:02,824
As Foundation members, we want to
make it appear like we pursued you.

1266
01:26:03,116 --> 01:26:04,779
- Please go easy on us.
- Please go easy on us.

1267
01:26:10,681 --> 01:26:13,810
Your swordsmanship hints at more
than just maintaining "appearances."

1268
01:26:14,377 --> 01:26:16,337
The Sharingan won't work.

1269
01:26:16,504 --> 01:26:18,840
We won't look into your eyes.

1270
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:24,828
A genjutsu?!

1271
01:26:28,803 --> 01:26:29,804
How?!

1272
01:26:30,268 --> 01:26:33,563
When you first came to me
as my subordinates…

1273
01:26:33,855 --> 01:26:35,781
<i>We are your subordinates from today.</i>

1274
01:26:38,276 --> 01:26:41,279
I imbedded a suggestion in case
you turned your sword on me.

1275
01:26:42,057 --> 01:26:46,524
You didn't trust us…
from the very beginning?

1276
01:26:47,347 --> 01:26:49,182
I was a double agent.

1277
01:26:49,954 --> 01:26:53,333
I see through the eyes of
both the Leaf and the Uchiha.

1278
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:56,753
To be frank,
I don't know whose spy I was...

1279
01:26:57,032 --> 01:26:58,609
even to this day.

1280
01:27:02,175 --> 01:27:03,718
Within the organization,

1281
01:27:03,801 --> 01:27:06,179
I'm known as Tobi.

1282
01:27:06,597 --> 01:27:08,182
I'm not an official member.

1283
01:27:09,015 --> 01:27:12,946
I'm a newbie within the Akatsuki who
doesn't possess any spectacular jutsu.

1284
01:27:13,459 --> 01:27:15,753
You should…
treat me the same way.

1285
01:27:16,057 --> 01:27:17,851
Why hide your true identity?

1286
01:27:18,187 --> 01:27:22,233
If word gets out that Madara Uchiha is
alive things could become complicated.

1287
01:27:23,930 --> 01:27:26,558
Only the leader of Akatsuki,
who we're meeting now,

1288
01:27:27,296 --> 01:27:29,006
knows my true identity.

1289
01:27:31,418 --> 01:27:33,003
The goal of the Akatsuki…

1290
01:27:33,685 --> 01:27:35,771
is a world of true peace
among shinobi.

1291
01:27:36,563 --> 01:27:38,231
Instead of the Five Great
Shinobi Nations,

1292
01:27:38,575 --> 01:27:40,536
the Akatsuki shall rule the world.

1293
01:27:41,193 --> 01:27:43,070
That's a big goal.

1294
01:27:43,516 --> 01:27:46,811
That's why we're assembling
skilled shinobi

1295
01:27:46,948 --> 01:27:49,117
without asking where they're from
or what they've done.

1296
01:27:49,614 --> 01:27:53,785
Itachi of the Hidden Leaf,
we welcome you into the Akatsuki.

1297
01:27:53,955 --> 01:27:55,999
From this moment on,
reject the Hidden Leaf.

1298
01:28:06,093 --> 01:28:09,137
From now…
you are Itachi of the Akatsuki.

1299
01:28:13,975 --> 01:28:15,769
Show the world pain…

1300
01:28:28,912 --> 01:28:29,913
Juzo...

1301
01:28:30,297 --> 01:28:31,298
Huh?

1302
01:28:31,599 --> 01:28:33,768
Form a two-man team with Itachi.

1303
01:28:34,913 --> 01:28:35,914
Okay.

1304
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:41,217
Follow me, newbie.

1305
01:28:41,504 --> 01:28:42,505
Yes.

1306
01:29:05,026 --> 01:29:07,988
Do you know a shinobi
named Might Dai?

1307
01:29:08,029 --> 01:29:10,532
I know a Might Guy.

1308
01:29:11,074 --> 01:29:14,639
Huh, well that’s the kid from that time.

1309
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:18,831
I was one of the Seven Ninja
Swordsmen of the Mist.

1310
01:29:19,398 --> 01:29:25,034
Thanks to Might Dai,
the seven of us got cut down to three.

1311
01:29:26,164 --> 01:29:31,136
Who could have expected that scuzzy
bearded jerk would use taijutsu like that?

1312
01:29:31,601 --> 01:29:34,979
Anyway, I wanna make
something clear...

1313
01:29:35,695 --> 01:29:39,532
I could care less why
you joined the Akatsuki.

1314
01:29:39,853 --> 01:29:41,897
I don’t even want
to hear your reason.

1315
01:29:42,314 --> 01:29:46,067
It doesn’t matter why I joined either.

1316
01:29:46,730 --> 01:29:48,931
And it’s okay if
you don’t want to know.

1317
01:29:50,655 --> 01:29:52,512
Listen to me!

1318
01:29:57,287 --> 01:30:00,916
There’s something
I need to ask you.

1319
01:30:01,387 --> 01:30:02,557
And…

1320
01:30:03,335 --> 01:30:05,545
It’s about your ninjutsu specialties.

1321
01:30:07,789 --> 01:30:12,802
As you see, I use this Executioner’s Blade
and cut up enemies.

1322
01:30:13,470 --> 01:30:15,347
So? How about you?

1323
01:30:15,347 --> 01:30:18,058
Genjutsu, Fire Style and Shuriken Jutsu.

1324
01:30:18,099 --> 01:30:20,894
You’re awfully humble!

1325
01:30:20,919 --> 01:30:25,465
Former ANBU Itachi Uchiha, Itachi of
the Sharingan, the Clan-Killer Itachi...

1326
01:30:25,544 --> 01:30:29,172
People throw around many nicknames
for you...you’re notorious.

1327
01:30:33,114 --> 01:30:35,575
Let’s decide on our formations.

1328
01:30:35,659 --> 01:30:39,237
You’ll start with a preemptive attack

1329
01:30:39,262 --> 01:30:41,831
with your genjutsu, shuriken or
whatever’s your specialty.

1330
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:43,666
Then I’ll jump in.

1331
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,324
And you back me up.

1332
01:30:47,093 --> 01:30:49,345
That will be Formation B

1333
01:30:49,548 --> 01:30:50,458
What’s A?

1334
01:30:50,762 --> 01:30:53,096
We each do things our own way.

1335
01:30:53,969 --> 01:30:55,227
Understood.

1336
01:30:55,907 --> 01:30:57,951
One word of warning.

1337
01:30:58,127 --> 01:31:00,880
Don’t take any opponent for granted.

1338
01:31:02,788 --> 01:31:03,831
Understood.

1339
01:31:16,966 --> 01:31:19,128
- Who are you?
- Get out of our way!

1340
01:31:19,174 --> 01:31:22,928
Shinobi villages only say things
about peace and order,

1341
01:31:23,123 --> 01:31:26,459
but they’re really worried
about their roles shrinking.

1342
01:31:26,683 --> 01:31:29,615
Behind the scenes,
they’re all trying

1343
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:32,665
to lessen their opponent’s power
while increasing their own.

1344
01:31:32,757 --> 01:31:36,476
All the while, preventing other nations
from finding out their schemes.

1345
01:31:36,874 --> 01:31:39,543
That’s why the Akatsuki gets jobs.

1346
01:31:39,681 --> 01:31:42,350
The more peaceful the world is,
the more work we get...

1347
01:31:43,388 --> 01:31:47,981
We accept every request.
We don’t care about the details.

1348
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:49,754
You scoundrels!

1349
01:31:50,061 --> 01:31:52,272
<i>Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!</i>

1350
01:31:58,908 --> 01:32:00,368
Why you—!

1351
01:32:08,347 --> 01:32:09,640
That’s why…

1352
01:32:09,665 --> 01:32:12,209
We don’t know who’s inside
this palanquin…

1353
01:32:12,317 --> 01:32:14,319
And we don’t want to know either.

1354
01:32:24,253 --> 01:32:27,062
There’s also no need to think about

1355
01:32:27,417 --> 01:32:31,656
who the hell would pay us
to do such dirty work.

1356
01:32:38,907 --> 01:32:41,034
That’s what the Akatsuki is about.

1357
01:32:42,035 --> 01:32:46,434
Pain, the leader, said the Akatsuki
was going to rule the world.

1358
01:32:46,998 --> 01:32:49,292
That won’t be for a long time.

1359
01:32:49,542 --> 01:32:52,463
We first need to amass money
and power.

1360
01:32:55,649 --> 01:32:57,943
Speak of the devil,
he’s summoning us.

1361
01:33:16,319 --> 01:33:19,906
<i>So Itachi, have you gotten
used to the Akatsuki?</i>

1362
01:33:19,906 --> 01:33:25,912
<i>How would you feel about changing
partners and teaming up with me?</i>

1363
01:33:25,937 --> 01:33:29,941
<i>Hey, we’re just getting
our formation down.</i>

1364
01:33:29,966 --> 01:33:31,843
<i>Don’t try to steal him.</i>

1365
01:33:32,001 --> 01:33:35,922
<i>I second changing partners...</i>

1366
01:33:35,922 --> 01:33:38,216
<i>There’s an aspect called compatibility...</i>

1367
01:33:38,341 --> 01:33:42,220
<i>I wish our leader would put
a bit more thought into this.</i>

1368
01:33:42,429 --> 01:33:45,351
<i>You’re one to talk, you damn snake!</i>

1369
01:33:52,397 --> 01:33:57,930
<i>Thanks to your work, Akatsuki’s reputation
is growing in the underworld.</i>

1370
01:33:58,647 --> 01:34:01,274
<i>The jobs we’re getting are
becoming bigger in scale,</i>

1371
01:34:01,299 --> 01:34:03,718
<i>which means higher compensation
as well.</i>

1372
01:34:04,708 --> 01:34:06,919
<i>But that’s only just a step.</i>

1373
01:34:06,988 --> 01:34:09,449
<i>And the Akatsuki is ready to
move on to the next step…</i>

1374
01:34:12,668 --> 01:34:14,455
<i>which are the Tailed Beasts.</i>

1375
01:34:14,743 --> 01:34:17,788
<i>There’re supposed to be nine of ‘em.
Are those the Tailed Beasts?</i>

1376
01:34:18,017 --> 01:34:21,979
<i>The Five Great Ninja Nations
harbor most of them.</i>

1377
01:34:22,011 --> 01:34:25,181
<i>But the whereabouts are unknown
for a few of them.</i>

1378
01:34:25,552 --> 01:34:28,681
<i>Those who aren’t on a job
will try to locate them.</i>

1379
01:34:28,730 --> 01:34:30,815
<i>So we just have to locate them?</i>

1380
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:32,216
<i>For now.</i>

1381
01:34:32,342 --> 01:34:34,167
<i>What will you do with them eventually?</i>

1382
01:34:34,481 --> 01:34:36,762
<i>We’ll hunt down and collect
every Tailed Beast.</i>

1383
01:34:37,066 --> 01:34:38,140
<i>And then?</i>

1384
01:34:38,165 --> 01:34:41,835
<i>They’ll act as our deterrents in our quest
for world domination.</i>

1385
01:34:42,118 --> 01:34:43,911
<i>Tailed Beasts?</i>

1386
01:34:44,497 --> 01:34:47,827
<i>Seems to me there are
lots of other ways…</i>

1387
01:34:48,119 --> 01:34:52,040
<i>There’s no mistake in
the leader’s reasoning.</i>

1388
01:34:52,081 --> 01:34:53,958
<i>Here are the assignments.</i>

1389
01:34:54,030 --> 01:34:55,090
<i>Juzo…</i>

1390
01:34:55,446 --> 01:34:58,157
<i>You’ll handle the request
from the Land of Water.</i>

1391
01:34:58,671 --> 01:35:01,925
<i>Isn’t there another mission I can do?!</i>

1392
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:04,235
<i>You’re familiar with the territory.</i>

1393
01:35:12,644 --> 01:35:14,070
This is ridiculous.

1394
01:35:14,438 --> 01:35:18,609
I never wanted to go back
to that depressing place.

1395
01:35:20,216 --> 01:35:22,264
Is that the village where you’re from?

1396
01:35:22,289 --> 01:35:24,499
The job’s easy.

1397
01:35:24,586 --> 01:35:26,361
We have to assassinate a member

1398
01:35:26,479 --> 01:35:28,837
from the Feudal Lord's clan
in the Land of Water.

1399
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:30,960
I'll explain...

1400
01:35:31,002 --> 01:35:33,921
It’s an intra-clan fight
over succession,

1401
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:36,125
a common occurrence in
the Land of Water.

1402
01:35:36,209 --> 01:35:40,129
The Hidden Mist cannot interfere
in the Feudal Clan's affairs.

1403
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:43,175
That’s why they’ve come to the Akatsuki.

1404
01:35:48,549 --> 01:35:50,510
This river’s the border.

1405
01:35:50,535 --> 01:35:52,449
Have you ever been to
the Land of Water?

1406
01:35:52,855 --> 01:35:54,239
Never on a mission.

1407
01:35:54,571 --> 01:35:56,030
So for an outing then?

1408
01:35:58,606 --> 01:36:00,900
You’ve got no sense of humor!

1409
01:36:01,065 --> 01:36:02,627
But you do know, don’t you?

1410
01:36:02,945 --> 01:36:06,240
What happens to a shinobi
from another village

1411
01:36:06,265 --> 01:36:08,267
if he’s discovered in
the Land of Water?

1412
01:36:08,573 --> 01:36:11,201
The Hidden Mist doesn’t have
a policy for prisoner exchange...

1413
01:36:11,226 --> 01:36:15,757
If captured, the shinobi will be made to
divulge his jutsu and he’ll be disposed of.

1414
01:36:16,011 --> 01:36:18,096
You have it good, Itachi.

1415
01:36:19,116 --> 01:36:20,562
The Leaf is naïve.

1416
01:36:21,125 --> 01:36:24,867
That’s why you and Orochimaru can go
around without a care as rogue ninja...

1417
01:36:25,535 --> 01:36:29,383
There is a special unit in the Hidden Mist
that track down rogue ninja.

1418
01:36:29,859 --> 01:36:32,154
If I ever get caught in this village…

1419
01:36:33,342 --> 01:36:36,762
Oh, I forgot all about Formation C.

1420
01:36:36,936 --> 01:36:41,640
If I’m caught by the Mist,
kill me immediately.

1421
01:36:42,888 --> 01:36:44,152
If I have a chance.

1422
01:36:44,967 --> 01:36:47,405
So what do you want me
to do for Formation D?

1423
01:36:49,783 --> 01:36:51,409
Nothing in particular.

1424
01:36:52,838 --> 01:36:54,590
Fine, let’s get going!

1425
01:37:06,739 --> 01:37:09,950
Are you good at infiltrating?

1426
01:37:09,975 --> 01:37:11,095
I'm average.

1427
01:37:11,466 --> 01:37:14,302
Okay, show me.

1428
01:37:30,782 --> 01:37:33,068
P-Please! Spare me!

1429
01:37:33,534 --> 01:37:35,617
I don’t bear a grudge against you.

1430
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:38,471
This is just my job.

1431
01:37:39,374 --> 01:37:41,379
W-Wait!

1432
01:37:45,589 --> 01:37:46,590
Hey…

1433
01:37:46,698 --> 01:37:47,699
Yeah.

1434
01:37:47,924 --> 01:37:49,410
<i>Hidden Mist Jutsu!</i>

1435
01:37:53,464 --> 01:37:55,525
<i>Wind Style: Supreme Typhoon!</i>

1436
01:37:56,432 --> 01:37:57,809
This is—?!

1437
01:38:04,190 --> 01:38:05,289
Lord Fourth!

1438
01:38:07,568 --> 01:38:08,903
Is that the Mizukage?

1439
01:38:09,112 --> 01:38:11,123
Do you remember my warning?

1440
01:38:12,532 --> 01:38:14,415
Any way you look at him,
he’s a kid.

1441
01:38:14,650 --> 01:38:17,570
He’s the Jinchuriki of
the Three Tails.

1442
01:38:18,413 --> 01:38:21,165
And they are the Mist’s
Shinobi Tracking Unit.

1443
01:38:21,207 --> 01:38:26,845
I never expected you to reappear
in the Village, Juzo.

1444
01:38:26,916 --> 01:38:29,877
I didn’t wanna come back either.
I had no choice.

1445
01:38:30,086 --> 01:38:32,767
I have a ton of things to say to you…

1446
01:38:32,812 --> 01:38:36,524
At the very least, I’m taking back
the Executioner’s Blade.

1447
01:38:36,955 --> 01:38:40,792
Even if your partner
is Itachi of the Sharingan.

1448
01:38:41,102 --> 01:38:46,691
So I guess a surprise attack with
your genjutsu is meaningless.

1449
01:38:46,791 --> 01:38:48,000
What do you want to do?

1450
01:38:48,025 --> 01:38:50,819
This one’s a Formation C.

1451
01:38:51,237 --> 01:38:53,948
Formation C? Understood.

1452
01:39:00,133 --> 01:39:01,289
Don’t look!

1453
01:39:05,668 --> 01:39:07,003
It's a Water Clone!

1454
01:39:08,629 --> 01:39:09,477
Itachi!

1455
01:39:09,502 --> 01:39:11,421
<i>Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!</i>

1456
01:39:15,017 --> 01:39:15,922
Lord Fourth!

1457
01:39:25,730 --> 01:39:27,023
<i>You two…</i>

1458
01:39:27,940 --> 01:39:29,484
<i>I’ll show no mercy.</i>

1459
01:39:32,999 --> 01:39:34,008
Tailed Beast State?!

1460
01:39:34,155 --> 01:39:38,284
The Fourth is a Jinchuriki
who can control his Tailed Beast!

1461
01:39:38,534 --> 01:39:40,244
This is not the Hidden Leaf!

1462
01:39:56,219 --> 01:39:57,178
Juzo!

1463
01:39:57,178 --> 01:39:59,472
It’s the Fourth’s Coral Palm Jutsu.

1464
01:40:10,274 --> 01:40:11,239
Juzo?!

1465
01:40:15,613 --> 01:40:18,366
Run...Itachi…

1466
01:40:30,628 --> 01:40:32,088
<i>W-What?!</i>

1467
01:40:33,172 --> 01:40:34,298
What is this?

1468
01:40:38,136 --> 01:40:40,555
The power of the Mangekyo Sharingan?

1469
01:40:50,606 --> 01:40:53,067
Why you—!

1470
01:41:02,877 --> 01:41:03,771
Juzo…?

1471
01:41:05,955 --> 01:41:09,000
Did you kill…the Mizukage?

1472
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,335
No, he’s not dead yet.

1473
01:41:11,718 --> 01:41:12,684
Then…

1474
01:41:13,838 --> 01:41:14,964
Hurry! Go!

1475
01:41:15,173 --> 01:41:16,257
But…

1476
01:41:16,826 --> 01:41:18,786
It's all over for me…

1477
01:41:19,186 --> 01:41:22,272
You don’t have to be
a Medic Ninja to know that, right?

1478
01:41:22,408 --> 01:41:23,451
I’m sorry.

1479
01:41:23,973 --> 01:41:25,183
What a stupid thing to say.

1480
01:41:25,850 --> 01:41:29,061
Do you have any last words
for anyone?

1481
01:41:30,938 --> 01:41:35,276
Like I'd have anyone, idiot.

1482
01:41:36,507 --> 01:41:40,552
I see…But you have someone
like that, huh?

1483
01:41:42,116 --> 01:41:43,576
Hurry and go!

1484
01:41:43,846 --> 01:41:47,505
I’m just gonna drop dead, right here,
where I'm from…

1485
01:41:48,206 --> 01:41:51,250
…this god-forsaken,
Blood Mist Village…

1486
01:41:52,210 --> 01:41:54,295
I thought my only partner…

1487
01:41:54,338 --> 01:41:56,715
was this guy here, but…

1488
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:40,692
<i>Juzo Biwa is dead.</i>

1489
01:42:41,384 --> 01:42:45,179
<i>Oh my, and he was
your teammate, Itachi.</i>

1490
01:42:45,221 --> 01:42:47,807
<i>The Jinchuriki of
the Three Tails killed him.</i>

1491
01:42:47,910 --> 01:42:52,874
<i>Which means you took on
the Mizukage and came out of it alive.</i>

1492
01:42:53,479 --> 01:42:55,648
<i>Another one of us is dead.</i>

1493
01:42:56,107 --> 01:43:02,113
<i>Rather than being killed by the enemy,
he was killed by friendly fire.</i>

1494
01:43:02,363 --> 01:43:05,201
<i>He was just too slow.</i>

1495
01:43:05,226 --> 01:43:08,563
<i>Let everyone here be the judge of that.</i>

1496
01:43:15,553 --> 01:43:16,930
<i>Fire Style: Searing Migraine!</i>

1497
01:43:20,791 --> 01:43:21,959
<i>Done in bad faith.</i>

1498
01:43:22,181 --> 01:43:23,807
<i>Sounds like it was on purpose.</i>

1499
01:43:24,302 --> 01:43:26,625
<i>He should have just dodged it.</i>

1500
01:43:26,887 --> 01:43:30,891
<i>You ignored your partner, didn't you?</i>

1501
01:43:31,017 --> 01:43:32,539
<i>So what?</i>

1502
01:43:32,564 --> 01:43:35,282
<i>You wanted to kill him, didn't you?</i>

1503
01:43:35,593 --> 01:43:37,011
<i>So what?</i>

1504
01:43:37,198 --> 01:43:39,596
<i>Oh, nothing. It just seems
to happen a lot.</i>

1505
01:43:41,158 --> 01:43:43,577
<i>The Akatsuki works in two-man teams.</i>

1506
01:43:43,904 --> 01:43:45,531
<i>What will you do, Kakuzu?</i>

1507
01:43:45,823 --> 01:43:48,826
<i>Will you team up with Itachi
who’s also lost his partner?</i>

1508
01:43:49,118 --> 01:43:52,496
<i>As long as he doesn’t irritate me.</i>

1509
01:43:52,697 --> 01:43:55,867
<i>I wouldn’t know how to cater
to your moods.</i>

1510
01:43:55,892 --> 01:43:59,353
<i>What the hell did you say?
Then let's team up and I'll show you.</i>

1511
01:43:59,688 --> 01:44:02,915
<i>Wait, I’ll team up with Itachi.</i>

1512
01:44:03,218 --> 01:44:06,361
<i>Are you trying to make a fool out of me?!</i>

1513
01:44:07,921 --> 01:44:10,715
<i>The Akatsuki needs to
find some new members.</i>

1514
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:14,309
<i>We’ll put this issue on hold until we do.</i>

1515
01:44:58,590 --> 01:45:02,052
Do you know what eternal life is, Itachi?

1516
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:06,570
I don’t know yet, either.

1517
01:45:06,595 --> 01:45:09,348
That’s why I need a new body.

1518
01:45:09,623 --> 01:45:13,084
A magnificent body to link me
to eternal life.

1519
01:45:13,559 --> 01:45:16,813
First of all, the problem with you…
is your greed.

1520
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:24,046
Impossible! Have I fallen prey to
the Paralysis Jutsu?

1521
01:45:25,923 --> 01:45:28,467
What incredible visual prowess…

1522
01:45:28,492 --> 01:45:30,132
Magnificent!

1523
01:45:52,700 --> 01:45:53,868
Orochimaru…

1524
01:45:54,410 --> 01:45:56,325
Try all of the jutsu you wish...

1525
01:45:56,516 --> 01:45:59,603
But, my eyes can see through
all of them.

1526
01:45:59,718 --> 01:46:01,595
You're so blunt…

1527
01:46:01,917 --> 01:46:04,635
I’m not sure what to do with you.

1528
01:46:04,917 --> 01:46:09,856
Whether to kill you right now,
or find a way to use you.

1529
01:46:10,112 --> 01:46:12,114
I-Itachi!

1530
01:46:12,348 --> 01:46:14,309
You just don’t have enough...

1531
01:46:16,015 --> 01:46:19,727
No, you lack it completely...the greed…

1532
01:46:23,085 --> 01:46:25,608
for human life!

1533
01:46:26,984 --> 01:46:27,993
Lord Orochimaru!

1534
01:46:29,312 --> 01:46:32,239
I’ll definitely get you back for this.

1535
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:44,251
Orochimaru betrayed and
deserted our organization.

1536
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:47,437
I knew it, that bastard.

1537
01:46:47,626 --> 01:46:50,965
He always put himself
before the organization.

1538
01:46:51,926 --> 01:46:55,221
I don’t intend to let Orochimaru
get away with this...

1539
01:46:55,429 --> 01:46:58,224
Leave Orochimaru to me.

1540
01:46:58,265 --> 01:47:04,188
His subordinate, Kabuto, is my puppet.

1541
01:47:04,213 --> 01:47:06,799
I’ll find out where
he’s hiding out in no time.

1542
01:47:07,489 --> 01:47:08,991
No need to rush.

1543
01:47:09,229 --> 01:47:11,732
I have someone in mind
to be your partner.

1544
01:47:11,978 --> 01:47:14,147
It can wait until he joins us.

1545
01:47:14,275 --> 01:47:15,526
What about me?

1546
01:47:15,789 --> 01:47:17,618
Do I team up with Itachi?

1547
01:47:17,816 --> 01:47:19,568
Work alone for a while longer.

1548
01:47:19,842 --> 01:47:23,179
I have someone else I’ve prepared
to partner up with Itachi.

1549
01:47:42,163 --> 01:47:45,207
I’m going to be your partner
from today.

1550
01:47:46,728 --> 01:47:47,854
The "Akatsuki"?

1551
01:47:48,103 --> 01:47:49,438
Don't know and don't care.

1552
01:47:49,990 --> 01:47:52,445
Now get lost! You're keeping me
from my "art appreciation" time.

1553
01:47:53,237 --> 01:47:57,366
And I have to take this brat on
as my partner?

1554
01:47:58,075 --> 01:47:59,868
Sure, he's full of energy,

1555
01:48:00,043 --> 01:48:02,963
but he seems like
the type to die young.

1556
01:48:03,679 --> 01:48:05,237
It's our leader's orders…

1557
01:48:05,698 --> 01:48:07,753
His talent will be very useful.

1558
01:48:08,669 --> 01:48:10,754
How do you know about my talent?

1559
01:48:11,088 --> 01:48:13,048
Just who the hell are you anyway?

1560
01:48:13,465 --> 01:48:16,844
We know you're aiding
anti-government factions

1561
01:48:17,272 --> 01:48:20,100
of neighboring nations with bombings…

1562
01:48:20,472 --> 01:48:23,934
You're a Rogue Ninja,
but what is your purpose?

1563
01:48:24,018 --> 01:48:26,979
Purpose? I don't need a purpose!

1564
01:48:27,438 --> 01:48:31,817
I take commissions to
cause explosions…using my art.

1565
01:48:33,819 --> 01:48:35,070
He's annoying…

1566
01:48:36,174 --> 01:48:37,406
Is he done?

1567
01:48:37,906 --> 01:48:39,158
Who knows…?

1568
01:48:41,118 --> 01:48:42,244
It doesn't matter.

1569
01:48:43,120 --> 01:48:44,121
I'll do it.

1570
01:48:54,757 --> 01:48:58,969
Let me make it clear,
I won't stop in my pursuit of art!

1571
01:48:59,845 --> 01:49:01,055
Do as you please.

1572
01:49:02,389 --> 01:49:05,726
But now that you're a part
of the Akatsuki,

1573
01:49:05,809 --> 01:49:07,686
I expect you to fulfill your missions.

1574
01:49:16,792 --> 01:49:18,170
All right, all right, I got it.

1575
01:49:18,364 --> 01:49:19,365
But…

1576
01:49:20,282 --> 01:49:21,575
you over there!

1577
01:49:21,823 --> 01:49:24,742
I'll never get caught up
in your genjutsu again, hmm!

1578
01:49:25,189 --> 01:49:26,899
Now that you're one of us,

1579
01:49:26,924 --> 01:49:29,594
I doubt that I'll have to
use my genjutsu on you.

1580
01:49:30,250 --> 01:49:34,588
I don't mind giving you
a taste of my art.

1581
01:49:34,613 --> 01:49:36,573
Leave it at that.

1582
01:49:37,425 --> 01:49:38,426
Sasori!

1583
01:49:39,433 --> 01:49:41,810
Partner with Deidara
and go kill Orochimaru.

1584
01:49:42,922 --> 01:49:44,649
About time.

1585
01:49:44,866 --> 01:49:47,160
Who is this Orochimaru?

1586
01:49:47,518 --> 01:49:49,645
I'll tell you on the way.

1587
01:49:49,853 --> 01:49:53,148
Orochimaru has escaped
into the Land of Wind.

1588
01:49:53,574 --> 01:49:55,367
Beyond that, I don't know.

1589
01:49:55,945 --> 01:49:58,531
That's all I need to know.

1590
01:49:58,556 --> 01:49:59,599
Let's go.

1591
01:50:01,107 --> 01:50:03,860
You Akatsuki sure like
to order guys around…

1592
01:50:04,076 --> 01:50:05,794
Hey, hurry up.

1593
01:50:05,819 --> 01:50:06,820
I know!

1594
01:50:08,497 --> 01:50:11,709
Itachi and Kisame,
go to the Hidden Grass Village.

1595
01:50:14,287 --> 01:50:15,789
What about my partner?

1596
01:50:16,839 --> 01:50:18,340
Wait just a while longer.

1597
01:50:20,543 --> 01:50:26,174
I've ordered Kabuto to keep me
updated through several ways.

1598
01:50:26,859 --> 01:50:30,112
If they're headed to
the Land of Wind, this is the spot…

1599
01:50:45,868 --> 01:50:48,120
The Great Sand Dune of the East…

1600
01:50:48,328 --> 01:50:49,221
I see…

1601
01:50:49,246 --> 01:50:52,708
That's one place the guys
from the Village won't go near.

1602
01:50:52,888 --> 01:50:54,807
Is that where you're from, my man?

1603
01:50:54,917 --> 01:50:56,961
I don't want to talk about it.

1604
01:50:57,212 --> 01:51:00,048
Anyway, that location
works out perfectly.

1605
01:51:06,305 --> 01:51:08,682
That's his hideout.

1606
01:51:08,917 --> 01:51:12,087
I'll blow the whole thing up
with my art, hmm!

1607
01:51:12,227 --> 01:51:15,773
We don't even know if
he's there or not.

1608
01:51:22,356 --> 01:51:23,566
Sand Snakes!

1609
01:51:23,739 --> 01:51:24,990
It's useless…

1610
01:51:26,533 --> 01:51:28,535
They know we're here.

1611
01:51:28,619 --> 01:51:29,620
Are you serious?

1612
01:51:29,870 --> 01:51:31,038
Let's go.

1613
01:51:39,261 --> 01:51:42,305
I was expecting Itachi to
be the one who'd come…

1614
01:51:42,563 --> 01:51:45,733
So you're the ones the Akatsuki sent?

1615
01:51:46,136 --> 01:51:49,640
We're going to kill you
without hesitation, you traitor.

1616
01:51:49,665 --> 01:51:51,250
Oh, do you really think you can?

1617
01:51:51,975 --> 01:51:54,059
You're the boy from the Hidden Stone…

1618
01:51:54,084 --> 01:51:55,879
You used to be in
the Demolitions Unit, right?

1619
01:51:55,979 --> 01:51:58,357
Don't treat me like a kid!

1620
01:52:02,444 --> 01:52:06,323
Keep watch from above and
make sure he doesn't get away.

1621
01:52:06,657 --> 01:52:07,866
What gives, my man?

1622
01:52:08,075 --> 01:52:09,952
Are you saying that you want
to capture him yourself?

1623
01:52:09,993 --> 01:52:13,789
Yeah, since you have
no grudges against him, right?

1624
01:52:17,584 --> 01:52:21,046
If you want back-up,
just call on me at any time, hmm!

1625
01:52:24,258 --> 01:52:27,177
I have the geographical
advantage here.

1626
01:52:35,018 --> 01:52:36,895
So that's your work, my man?

1627
01:52:37,184 --> 01:52:41,316
You're aware of
the Third Kazekage's power, aren't you?

1628
01:52:41,859 --> 01:52:42,860
Yes…

1629
01:52:43,110 --> 01:52:47,916
My hobby is to collect things that I
find interesting, so I took a little bit.

1630
01:52:59,752 --> 01:53:00,845
What the hell?

1631
01:53:01,003 --> 01:53:01,906
Huh?

1632
01:53:01,931 --> 01:53:02,932
What's that over there?

1633
01:53:13,015 --> 01:53:14,266
Is that you, Sasori…?

1634
01:53:14,291 --> 01:53:16,659
You bastard, how dare
you do this to me!

1635
01:53:16,908 --> 01:53:18,827
What's that, you damn snake?

1636
01:53:18,979 --> 01:53:22,107
It‘s the Third Kazekage
that you killed.

1637
01:53:22,524 --> 01:53:25,569
I used a Forbidden Jutsu
to resurrect him.

1638
01:53:25,856 --> 01:53:28,108
Things won't go the way
they did last time…

1639
01:53:28,405 --> 01:53:30,532
Enough of your resentful complaints…

1640
01:53:35,595 --> 01:53:36,408
Now then…

1641
01:53:37,864 --> 01:53:40,200
With your Human Puppet…

1642
01:53:40,417 --> 01:53:42,085
and my Forbidden Jutsu.

1643
01:53:42,252 --> 01:53:44,463
Let's see which is superior!

1644
01:53:45,005 --> 01:53:47,007
Damn you…

1645
01:53:49,384 --> 01:53:50,844
<i>Iron Sand: Scattered Showers!</i>

1646
01:54:09,279 --> 01:54:13,380
Unlike the real thing, the puppet stops
working when Iron Sand gets into it, right?

1647
01:54:13,470 --> 01:54:16,974
Don't lecture me about puppets!

1648
01:54:33,845 --> 01:54:37,683
Unlike the real thing, I've built in
lots of hidden tricks into the puppet.

1649
01:54:37,708 --> 01:54:39,418
It's your turn…

1650
01:54:40,758 --> 01:54:41,759
Not yet.

1651
01:54:43,551 --> 01:54:44,552
What?!

1652
01:54:44,729 --> 01:54:47,106
This is one form of immortality…

1653
01:54:47,456 --> 01:54:50,167
It doesn't die, even though
it's already dead.

1654
01:54:50,369 --> 01:54:53,456
There's no way it can't die!

1655
01:55:11,800 --> 01:55:12,529
Heargh!

1656
01:55:17,347 --> 01:55:19,850
Well?! How do you like my art?!

1657
01:55:30,575 --> 01:55:31,826
Why doesn't it die?

1658
01:55:32,291 --> 01:55:37,046
After you two die, I'll resurrect you
both in the same way.

1659
01:55:39,036 --> 01:55:42,080
Although, what I really wanted…

1660
01:55:43,040 --> 01:55:45,625
was Itachi's body.

1661
01:55:52,174 --> 01:55:53,008
My man!

1662
01:55:53,091 --> 01:55:55,052
Does that guy have a weakness?!

1663
01:55:55,052 --> 01:55:59,014
Resurrection isn't one of
the Third's abilities…

1664
01:56:05,062 --> 01:56:07,773
You are both going to become
my pawns forever.

1665
01:56:13,487 --> 01:56:14,946
Stop kidding around…

1666
01:56:16,948 --> 01:56:20,410
I…am the Third Kazekage…

1667
01:56:23,038 --> 01:56:24,164
I am not...

1668
01:56:25,035 --> 01:56:26,523
your pawn!

1669
01:56:33,423 --> 01:56:34,966
Oh my…

1670
01:56:34,966 --> 01:56:37,803
I wonder if my jutsu wasn't complete?

1671
01:56:38,061 --> 01:56:39,625
Take this!

1672
01:56:44,893 --> 01:56:46,144
Is he dead?!

1673
01:56:51,358 --> 01:56:52,776
Don't run away!

1674
01:56:58,448 --> 01:56:59,324
Heargh!

1675
01:57:04,746 --> 01:57:05,872
Art is…!

1676
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:08,416
…an explosion!

1677
01:57:10,502 --> 01:57:12,295
Hey, c'mon now…

1678
01:57:15,812 --> 01:57:18,106
<i>We thoroughly searched
the mountain of rubble,</i>

1679
01:57:18,131 --> 01:57:20,508
<i>but we didn't find his corpse.</i>

1680
01:57:20,996 --> 01:57:23,040
<i>So we can't say for sure
that we killed him.</i>

1681
01:57:23,140 --> 01:57:26,768
<i>If he's alive,
I swear I'll kill him myself.</i>

1682
01:57:27,640 --> 01:57:30,351
<i>Besides, what was with
that ridiculous jutsu?!</i>

1683
01:57:31,225 --> 01:57:32,559
<i>Do you know anything about it?</i>

1684
01:57:33,358 --> 01:57:37,487
<i>It's probably the Second Hokage's
Reanimation Jutsu.</i>

1685
01:57:37,980 --> 01:57:41,066
<i>You bring the dead back to life,
and control them like a puppet.</i>

1686
01:57:41,366 --> 01:57:43,118
<i>You can't kill it even if you tried.</i>

1687
01:57:43,936 --> 01:57:48,381
<i>So you must use a Sealing Jutsu
or suppress their movement forcefully.</i>

1688
01:57:49,038 --> 01:57:51,040
<i>We just have to kill Orochimaru, right?</i>

1689
01:57:51,334 --> 01:57:54,087
<i>Even that won't stop a reanimated being…</i>

1690
01:57:54,592 --> 01:57:55,885
<i>What's the supposed to mean?</i>

1691
01:57:56,339 --> 01:57:59,092
<i>Be wary of Orochimaru from now on.</i>

1692
01:57:59,831 --> 01:58:02,209
<i>If he's alive,
he's bound to make another move.</i>

1693
01:58:02,914 --> 01:58:06,667
<i>Ordinarily, no one could
survive that explosion, hmm.</i>

1694
01:58:07,309 --> 01:58:11,104
<i>No one who joins us is ordinary.</i>

1695
01:58:11,438 --> 01:58:14,524
<i>Another immortal has appeared
out of the woodwork.</i>

1696
01:58:14,921 --> 01:58:16,715
<i>We have a request from
the Land of Steam.</i>

1697
01:58:17,027 --> 01:58:20,113
<i>A homicidal maniac has appeared
and they want us to eliminate him.</i>

1698
01:58:20,405 --> 01:58:23,491
<i>Don't they have
their own Hidden Steam shinobi?</i>

1699
01:58:23,575 --> 01:58:25,535
<i>Apparently, they can't kill it.</i>

1700
01:58:25,972 --> 01:58:28,225
<i>So this homicidal maniac
is immortal too?</i>

1701
01:58:28,565 --> 01:58:32,406
<i>Was he "reani-whatevered"
by Orochimaru too?</i>

1702
01:58:32,792 --> 01:58:36,046
<i>I'm dispatching
a different team this time.</i>

1703
01:58:43,882 --> 01:58:44,920
You there…

1704
01:58:48,722 --> 01:58:50,599
Would you like to join
the Way of Jashin?

1705
01:58:57,108 --> 01:58:59,569
This wasn't for money or revenge.

1706
01:59:00,186 --> 01:59:02,105
This was out of
a deep desire to kill.

1707
01:59:02,739 --> 01:59:05,700
There are other ways
to quench blood thirst…

1708
01:59:06,404 --> 01:59:08,489
He had some other purpose.

1709
01:59:09,770 --> 01:59:13,107
You really have
a way of irritating me.

1710
01:59:15,975 --> 01:59:20,229
And you...Did you come to
make sure I don't kill Itachi?

1711
01:59:20,845 --> 01:59:23,097
There are no other
Sensory types besides me.

1712
01:59:23,677 --> 01:59:24,678
And…

1713
01:59:24,776 --> 01:59:27,821
The others certainly aren't
cut out to be decoys.

1714
01:59:29,766 --> 01:59:30,850
Decoys?

1715
01:59:37,315 --> 01:59:38,358
All right then…

1716
01:59:42,946 --> 01:59:44,739
Hey, you over there.

1717
01:59:45,311 --> 01:59:47,271
Do you want to join
the Way of Jashin?

1718
01:59:47,953 --> 01:59:49,205
Way of Jashin?

1719
01:59:49,232 --> 01:59:51,150
Yeah, the Way of Jashin…

1720
01:59:52,205 --> 01:59:53,373
What is that?

1721
01:59:53,814 --> 01:59:56,609
You can kill people and
you won't be punished.

1722
01:59:56,853 --> 02:00:00,690
In fact, it just pleases
Lord Jashin even more.

1723
02:00:01,673 --> 02:00:02,674
I see…

1724
02:00:02,716 --> 02:00:05,218
What do you say?
Isn't that a wonderful teaching?

1725
02:00:05,468 --> 02:00:06,928
Are you interested in joining?

1726
02:00:07,592 --> 02:00:10,887
So you're the homicidal maniac…

1727
02:00:11,308 --> 02:00:13,768
Homicidal maniac?
That's not it at all.

1728
02:00:14,493 --> 02:00:17,245
I'm just offering up prayers
to Lord Jashin.

1729
02:00:18,106 --> 02:00:21,568
Looks like I'll just have to
offer you up to Lord Jashin.

1730
02:00:22,235 --> 02:00:23,236
Well?

1731
02:00:23,987 --> 02:00:25,780
He doesn't seem to be
a Reanimation.

1732
02:00:26,239 --> 02:00:29,451
Fine. I'll test him to see
how immortal he is.

1733
02:00:29,826 --> 02:00:32,579
Who are you guys,
dressed up all the same?

1734
02:00:32,620 --> 02:00:34,956
You in an orchestra or
band or something?

1735
02:00:35,373 --> 02:00:38,335
Let's see...The gloomy one
over there plays bass…

1736
02:00:38,668 --> 02:00:40,879
The girl does vocals and keyboards…

1737
02:00:41,288 --> 02:00:43,999
No, maybe that guy there
does vocals?

1738
02:00:44,217 --> 02:00:45,927
We're nothing like that.

1739
02:00:47,260 --> 02:00:50,347
I think Lord Jashin would like
you guys as an offering.

1740
02:00:58,146 --> 02:01:00,408
What's wrong?
Is running around all you can do?!

1741
02:01:00,443 --> 02:01:02,027
Well, I won't let you get away!

1742
02:01:15,830 --> 02:01:18,208
What? Done so soon?

1743
02:01:21,391 --> 02:01:22,497
Ouch…

1744
02:01:26,415 --> 02:01:29,232
That hurt!

1745
02:01:30,136 --> 02:01:31,179
Oh…

1746
02:01:31,788 --> 02:01:34,541
I'll punish you in the name of god!

1747
02:01:46,111 --> 02:01:49,239
That's not gonna help you!

1748
02:01:49,864 --> 02:01:52,659
Looks like the rumors about
your immortality are true.

1749
02:01:53,034 --> 02:01:56,329
Okay, let's start the ritual.

1750
02:02:04,504 --> 02:02:07,048
Everything is ready!

1751
02:02:07,651 --> 02:02:10,987
Die…!

1752
02:02:16,573 --> 02:02:19,200
One stab into the heart…

1753
02:02:22,335 --> 02:02:23,920
Damn you!

1754
02:02:25,316 --> 02:02:27,569
It feels so good…

1755
02:02:28,154 --> 02:02:31,032
Glory be to Lord Jashin!

1756
02:02:41,416 --> 02:02:44,169
You bastard…You got some nerve…

1757
02:02:44,210 --> 02:02:46,463
Hey, hey...Why didn't you die?

1758
02:02:47,255 --> 02:02:48,381
I'll beat you to death!

1759
02:02:49,048 --> 02:02:50,175
No, you can't!

1760
02:02:50,467 --> 02:02:51,593
Did you notice anything?

1761
02:02:52,010 --> 02:02:53,845
He licked Kakuzu's blood

1762
02:02:54,279 --> 02:02:55,655
and then mentioned something
about a ritual.

1763
02:02:55,680 --> 02:02:57,265
That's probably some jutsu too.

1764
02:02:58,057 --> 02:03:01,936
He passes on any damage he sustains
to the one whose blood he licks.

1765
02:03:02,395 --> 02:03:04,647
However, that doesn't
explain his immortality.

1766
02:03:05,815 --> 02:03:07,275
Can you separate them?

1767
02:03:07,859 --> 02:03:09,277
Weren't you going to eliminate him?

1768
02:03:09,819 --> 02:03:10,778
Yeah.

1769
02:03:16,534 --> 02:03:18,161
W-What?!

1770
02:03:22,707 --> 02:03:24,375
What's the big idea, Itachi?!

1771
02:03:25,376 --> 02:03:27,212
Seems they're recruiting him.

1772
02:03:28,626 --> 02:03:30,253
A guy like him?

1773
02:03:32,356 --> 02:03:34,233
Are you kidding me? I refuse!

1774
02:03:34,580 --> 02:03:36,499
Whatever the Akatsuki is…

1775
02:03:36,763 --> 02:03:39,724
I have a mission to spread
the Way of Jashin.

1776
02:03:40,350 --> 02:03:44,771
Then you should join the Akatsuki
for the sake of your mission too.

1777
02:03:45,563 --> 02:03:46,606
What?

1778
02:03:46,940 --> 02:03:49,275
Assassinations, war, you name it,

1779
02:03:49,359 --> 02:03:53,029
the Akatsuki will do anything…
since we're a band of killers.

1780
02:04:01,216 --> 02:04:04,541
I plan to continue propagating
the Way of Jashin.

1781
02:04:05,250 --> 02:04:06,251
Do as you please.

1782
02:04:11,589 --> 02:04:13,299
Our two-man teams are in place.

1783
02:04:13,841 --> 02:04:15,802
Go and execute your missions.

1784
02:04:18,581 --> 02:04:21,251
I didn't expect to be
partnered with you.

1785
02:04:21,392 --> 02:04:23,436
You took the words out of my mouth.

1786
02:04:23,893 --> 02:04:26,396
Don't irritate me,
or I'll kill you.

1787
02:04:26,938 --> 02:04:29,190
Like I said. Just try it!

1788
02:04:29,232 --> 02:04:31,526
I don't want your heart.

1789
02:04:48,190 --> 02:04:49,335
Art…

1790
02:04:52,755 --> 02:04:54,507
…is an explosion!

1791
02:04:56,926 --> 02:04:57,927
It's art!

1792
02:04:58,177 --> 02:05:01,472
I still don't get what
your art is about.

1793
02:05:01,639 --> 02:05:07,061
Soon, you'll understand the aesthetics
of something that's fleeting, hmm.

1794
02:05:07,145 --> 02:05:09,022
Hm? It's the leader.

1795
02:05:11,310 --> 02:05:14,554
A shinobi village named the Hidden
Sound recently came into existence.

1796
02:05:16,268 --> 02:05:20,617
It's possible that
Orochimaru is involved.

1797
02:05:21,159 --> 02:05:22,160
That guy!

1798
02:05:22,662 --> 02:05:24,831
<i>I want you two to
covertly check them out.</i>

1799
02:05:26,228 --> 02:05:29,953
Since you guys specialize in sneaking
around behind the scenes.

1800
02:05:30,392 --> 02:05:32,268
I'll find him!

1801
02:05:32,524 --> 02:05:33,734
And make him go boom!

1802
02:05:34,172 --> 02:05:37,091
The orders were to do it covertly.

1803
02:05:54,232 --> 02:05:57,028
<i>There's been an incident
at the Hidden Leaf Village.</i>

1804
02:05:57,160 --> 02:05:58,745
<i>Orochimaru's behind it.</i>

1805
02:06:01,074 --> 02:06:04,369
<i>Orochimaru used shinobi from
the Hidden Sound and Hidden Sand</i>

1806
02:06:04,777 --> 02:06:06,696
<i>to wage war against the Leaf…</i>

1807
02:06:07,205 --> 02:06:09,290
<i>But he failed to completely
destroy the Leaf.</i>

1808
02:06:10,334 --> 02:06:11,502
Serves him right!

1809
02:06:11,793 --> 02:06:14,921
<i>The Third Hokage
was killed in battle.</i>

1810
02:06:15,497 --> 02:06:17,916
<i>Orochimaru withdrew,
but his whereabouts are unknown.</i>

1811
02:06:18,216 --> 02:06:20,176
<i>I'll send someone out
to investigate, but…</i>

1812
02:06:20,218 --> 02:06:21,260
I'll go.

1813
02:06:22,178 --> 02:06:24,097
<i>Then I'll leave this to you,</i>

1814
02:06:24,450 --> 02:06:26,577
<i>as well as the status
of the Leaf's Jinchuriki.</i>

1815
02:06:29,894 --> 02:06:32,647
It seems they
averted total destruction,

1816
02:06:32,897 --> 02:06:35,233
but they've sustained
massive damage.

1817
02:06:35,692 --> 02:06:38,277
That Village was at
the height of prosperity…

1818
02:06:38,481 --> 02:06:39,649
How tragic.

1819
02:06:40,577 --> 02:06:42,162
That was out of character.

1820
02:06:42,347 --> 02:06:46,477
So even you have feelings
for your birthplace, after all?

1821
02:06:46,594 --> 02:06:47,595
No…

1822
02:06:52,959 --> 02:06:54,043
Not at all.

1823
02:06:57,672 --> 02:07:01,092
<i>Sasuke...Are you safe?</i>

1824
02:07:06,222 --> 02:07:07,598
Kakashi.

1825
02:07:07,623 --> 02:07:09,709
It's unusual that
you're here first.

1826
02:07:11,018 --> 02:07:12,687
Well, it happens once in a while.

1827
02:07:12,687 --> 02:07:15,648
What's going on?
Why did you summon us here?

1828
02:07:17,590 --> 02:07:18,632
<i>Sasuke!</i>

1829
02:07:19,902 --> 02:07:21,654
<i>You've grown up…</i>

1830
02:07:31,748 --> 02:07:34,292
It's been a long time, Sasuke.

1831
02:07:34,792 --> 02:07:37,420
Itachi Uchiha!

1832
02:07:38,379 --> 02:07:39,350
I will…

1833
02:07:41,132 --> 02:07:42,133
…kill you!

1834
02:07:42,774 --> 02:07:45,219
Ah…the Sharingan.

1835
02:07:45,553 --> 02:07:50,725
I see a resemblance…
Just who is he?

1836
02:07:51,108 --> 02:07:53,819
He's my younger brother.

1837
02:07:55,686 --> 02:07:57,562
<i>So you've awakened your Sharingan.</i>

1838
02:07:58,024 --> 02:07:59,525
<i>Otherwise…</i>

1839
02:08:00,588 --> 02:08:02,548
It's just as you've said.

1840
02:08:02,940 --> 02:08:05,776
I've hated you, and resented you.

1841
02:08:05,914 --> 02:08:09,835
I have lived my life…

1842
02:08:10,286 --> 02:08:12,038
<i>How strong have you gotten?</i>

1843
02:08:13,122 --> 02:08:16,480
…for the sole purpose
of killing you…

1844
02:08:16,564 --> 02:08:17,565
<i>Chidori?!</i>

1845
02:08:27,090 --> 02:08:29,468
<i>I see…it was Kakashi, huh?</i>

1846
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:34,921
Sasuke!

1847
02:08:35,177 --> 02:08:36,715
Damn it!

1848
02:08:39,023 --> 02:08:40,691
<i>Ninja Art: Summoning—!</i>

1849
02:08:40,716 --> 02:08:41,717
Too slow!

1850
02:08:50,952 --> 02:08:52,203
Master Jiraiya!

1851
02:08:52,804 --> 02:08:55,139
So your target is Naruto,
after all?

1852
02:08:55,540 --> 02:09:01,003
Taking Naruto is the overriding mission
we have been assigned to, by the Akatsuki.

1853
02:09:01,796 --> 02:09:05,049
I can't let you have Naruto.

1854
02:09:05,967 --> 02:09:07,552
I wonder about that…

1855
02:09:09,572 --> 02:09:13,622
Perfect timing. I will get rid of
both of you right here.

1856
02:09:13,647 --> 02:09:14,898
Don't interfere…

1857
02:09:17,144 --> 02:09:24,193
If anyone is going to kill him…
It will be me.

1858
02:09:25,038 --> 02:09:27,832
I have no interest
in you right now.

1859
02:09:28,489 --> 02:09:30,908
<i>Not yet, Sasuke.</i>

1860
02:09:34,704 --> 02:09:35,788
Sasuke!

1861
02:09:35,830 --> 02:09:37,582
Damn it!

1862
02:09:37,915 --> 02:09:39,166
Naruto!

1863
02:09:39,417 --> 02:09:41,503
I said not to interfere!

1864
02:09:43,087 --> 02:09:45,131
This is my fight!

1865
02:09:47,842 --> 02:09:48,843
<i>That's right.</i>

1866
02:09:50,386 --> 02:09:51,888
Fine by me!

1867
02:09:57,560 --> 02:09:59,312
<i>You still don't have enough…</i>

1868
02:10:04,859 --> 02:10:06,944
<i>Forgive me, Sasuke.</i>

1869
02:10:07,778 --> 02:10:09,071
<i>Forgive me!</i>

1870
02:10:09,947 --> 02:10:11,782
You are merciless.

1871
02:10:23,586 --> 02:10:25,880
<i>Hate me…</i>

1872
02:10:28,132 --> 02:10:30,009
<i>You are weak.</i>

1873
02:10:31,135 --> 02:10:35,765
<i>From now, for 24 hours…
Relive that day.</i>

1874
02:10:39,287 --> 02:10:41,831
Using Tsukuyomi on
your younger brother?

1875
02:10:42,480 --> 02:10:45,524
That's enough…outta…you!

1876
02:10:57,328 --> 02:11:03,459
You are weak, because
you don't have enough hatred.

1877
02:11:03,960 --> 02:11:05,252
C'mon, Kisame!

1878
02:11:06,379 --> 02:11:07,588
Wait! Why you—!

1879
02:11:11,634 --> 02:11:13,886
Why did we have to retreat?

1880
02:11:14,387 --> 02:11:15,596
You could have—!

1881
02:11:16,041 --> 02:11:17,042
<i>Sasuke…</i>

1882
02:11:17,556 --> 02:11:19,684
<i>Even though Lord Third is dead,</i>

1883
02:11:19,767 --> 02:11:22,103
<i>you still have people
who will protect you…</i>

1884
02:11:23,270 --> 02:11:25,147
<i>I'll be waiting, Sasuke.</i>

1885
02:11:31,696 --> 02:11:33,781
Why are you so obsessed
with my brother?

1886
02:11:34,740 --> 02:11:36,158
He's just a Rogue Ninja.

1887
02:11:36,867 --> 02:11:39,036
That's because, unlike you…

1888
02:11:39,328 --> 02:11:42,123
He's more of a brother to me
than you are to him…

1889
02:11:47,545 --> 02:11:50,840
<i>You've been trying to take Sasuke
back to the village.</i>

1890
02:11:51,632 --> 02:11:54,802
<i>But what if it doesn't
go the way you want it to?</i>

1891
02:11:55,302 --> 02:11:57,221
I'll do anything to bring him back!

1892
02:11:57,722 --> 02:12:01,726
<i>You just said you consider
Sasuke to be like a brother…</i>

1893
02:12:02,123 --> 02:12:06,169
<i>What if Sasuke were to attack
the Hidden Leaf Village?</i>

1894
02:12:06,194 --> 02:12:07,779
<i>What would you do then?</i>

1895
02:12:08,065 --> 02:12:10,443
What? Why would Sasuke—?

1896
02:12:10,818 --> 02:12:12,570
There's no way
he'd do something like that!

1897
02:12:13,559 --> 02:12:15,520
<i>Sasuke is still a blank canvas.</i>

1898
02:12:16,240 --> 02:12:18,409
<i>He can easily be dyed
into any color.</i>

1899
02:12:18,909 --> 02:12:22,747
<i>In that case,
would you be able to stop him?</i>

1900
02:12:24,923 --> 02:12:26,758
<i>Even if you have to kill Sasuke?</i>

1901
02:12:29,295 --> 02:12:32,631
<i>Could you weigh Sasuke against
the Hidden Leaf on a set of scales?</i>

1902
02:12:33,582 --> 02:12:34,833
I would defend the Leaf Village!

1903
02:12:35,125 --> 02:12:37,669
And I would find a way to stop
Sasuke without killing him!

1904
02:12:38,861 --> 02:12:40,154
<i>You're such a child…</i>

1905
02:12:40,556 --> 02:12:43,100
<i>What you speak of
are all fantasies.</i>

1906
02:12:43,476 --> 02:12:47,438
<i>A shinobi must be capable of
making very harsh decisions.</i>

1907
02:12:48,144 --> 02:12:51,108
Someone else tried to tell me
the same thing before.

1908
02:12:51,591 --> 02:12:53,259
But for me, there is no choice.

1909
02:12:53,846 --> 02:12:56,515
I never go back on my word…

1910
02:12:56,989 --> 02:12:58,866
That's my ninja way.

1911
02:12:59,669 --> 02:13:00,670
<i>I see.</i>

1912
02:13:04,465 --> 02:13:05,284
You've come…

1913
02:13:07,620 --> 02:13:11,540
That Sharingan…
How much can you actually see?

1914
02:13:12,004 --> 02:13:14,757
What I'm seeing right now…

1915
02:13:14,799 --> 02:13:17,760
Is your death, Itachi.

1916
02:13:19,553 --> 02:13:21,472
My death, huh?

1917
02:13:25,309 --> 02:13:26,352
Well then…

1918
02:13:29,772 --> 02:13:31,232
…make it happen.

1919
02:14:01,720 --> 02:14:04,723
If I had been open with you
from the start…

1920
02:14:04,765 --> 02:14:08,144
and looked you straight in
the eyes and told you the truth,

1921
02:14:08,936 --> 02:14:10,980
Forgive me, Sasuke…

1922
02:14:11,786 --> 02:14:12,954
This is the end.

1923
02:14:15,776 --> 02:14:17,795
then I wouldn't have had
to stand before you,

1924
02:14:17,820 --> 02:14:20,573
from above, as a failure,
telling you all of this.

1925
02:14:21,853 --> 02:14:26,733
So this time, I want to impart
this truth to you…

1926
02:14:32,659 --> 02:14:35,462
You don't ever have to forgive me.

1927
02:14:37,011 --> 02:14:39,931
And no matter what you do
from here on out, know this…

1928
02:14:43,429 --> 02:14:46,515
I will love you always.
