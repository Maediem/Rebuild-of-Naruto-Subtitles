1
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,608
Hey, Kakashi!

2
00:00:12,265 --> 00:00:14,222
Come join us for
some sweet dumplings!

3
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:22,201
<i>Me? A jonin leader
in charge of genin?</i>

4
00:00:26,947 --> 00:00:27,948
<i>Minato Sensei...</i>

5
00:00:29,222 --> 00:00:30,408
You're late, Obito!

6
00:00:31,159 --> 00:00:34,009
You're finally here...
You must be Obito.

7
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:35,411
We've been waiting for you.

8
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:37,596
Barely made it...

9
00:00:37,948 --> 00:00:39,324
You're really late.

10
00:00:39,635 --> 00:00:43,431
We've already introduced ourselves.
You're the only one left!

11
00:00:45,374 --> 00:00:47,008
I'm going to be the Hokage!

12
00:00:47,568 --> 00:00:48,898
My name's Obito Uchiha!

13
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,359
For my Great Stone Face,

14
00:00:51,578 --> 00:00:55,946
make sure my trademark goggles and
Sharingan are nicely carved out!

15
00:00:57,376 --> 00:01:00,379
So I can glare over
the neighboring lands!

16
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,689
I'll scare the hell out of them
with my Sharingan stare...

17
00:01:05,714 --> 00:01:07,953
and no one will
dare attack our village!

18
00:01:08,275 --> 00:01:10,516
Rattle off your instructions
after you become the Hokage

19
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:12,155
and activate your Sharingan.

20
00:01:12,845 --> 00:01:15,383
Besides, how can they carve the Sharingan
if you're wearing goggles?

21
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:18,271
They can carve it out over my goggles!

22
00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:21,360
Then it will look like your eyeballs
are popping out.

23
00:01:24,426 --> 00:01:29,064
Anyway...I'm happy that someone on
this team shares my dream.

24
00:01:29,361 --> 00:01:31,502
I'm Minato.
From today, I'll be your superior.

25
00:01:31,594 --> 00:01:32,275
I'm glad to meet you!

26
00:01:32,474 --> 00:01:33,475
Yeah!

27
00:01:35,607 --> 00:01:38,318
All right, let's have
our first practice together.

28
00:01:38,977 --> 00:01:40,061
Y-Yes!

29
00:01:40,732 --> 00:01:44,027
In this training session,
I want to see your teamwork.

30
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:48,029
Teamwork?

31
00:01:48,827 --> 00:01:52,372
Take these two bells away from me,
and practice will be over.

32
00:01:52,991 --> 00:01:53,823
Simple, right?

33
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,548
Two bells mean...

34
00:01:57,687 --> 00:01:58,697
Exactly.

35
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,289
Huh? What does it mean?

36
00:02:06,217 --> 00:02:09,053
One of us will be dropped
from the team.

37
00:02:09,225 --> 00:02:10,226
What?!

38
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,041
Good observation.

39
00:02:12,697 --> 00:02:14,407
Okay...Let's start.

40
00:02:17,107 --> 00:02:20,319
I'm your jonin leader, Hatake...

41
00:02:20,344 --> 00:02:21,841
Kakashi Sensei, right?

42
00:02:22,287 --> 00:02:24,581
Never mind the formalities...

43
00:02:24,669 --> 00:02:26,129
Let's just get started!

44
00:02:27,382 --> 00:02:29,249
What you're going to do...

45
00:02:29,681 --> 00:02:31,780
has a failure rate of 66%.

46
00:02:31,805 --> 00:02:36,018
<i>During that practice,
I wasn't even thinking of teamwork.</i>

47
00:02:37,933 --> 00:02:41,645
<i>And Minato Sensei
didn't even notice it.</i>

48
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,547
You all pass!

49
00:02:49,786 --> 00:02:52,105
Let's strengthen
our teamwork even more!

50
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:53,474
– Right!
– Yes!

51
00:03:00,207 --> 00:03:05,129
In other words, one of you will definitely
be sent back to the Academy.

52
00:03:06,675 --> 00:03:09,303
<i>It's no wonder Minato Sensei
didn't notice.</i>

53
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:14,111
<i>I pretended to work with the team
and used the other two.</i>

54
00:03:20,806 --> 00:03:23,225
<i>I know he's giving us a break...</i>

55
00:03:23,877 --> 00:03:26,183
<i>But Minato Sensei is way too skilled.</i>

56
00:03:26,798 --> 00:03:28,474
<i>There's no way I can do it alone.</i>

57
00:03:28,534 --> 00:03:29,535
Close!

58
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,336
Whoa...

59
00:03:32,221 --> 00:03:35,224
You'll never get it
at the rate you're going.

60
00:03:36,194 --> 00:03:37,195
<i>I knew it.</i>

61
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:41,384
<i>Minato Sensei is making
an allowance for our skill levels!</i>

62
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,350
<i>Compared to how he is
against Obito and Rin...</i>

63
00:03:48,745 --> 00:03:52,874
<i>With me,
he doesn't ease up as much.</i>

64
00:03:54,991 --> 00:03:58,203
<i>At this rate,
I'm definitely not getting a bell.</i>

65
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,354
<i>In order to complete this mission...</i>

66
00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:03,790
Obito! Rin!

67
00:04:06,566 --> 00:04:08,944
The first formation we learned
at the academy!

68
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:09,707
Huh?

69
00:04:09,854 --> 00:04:14,984
I doubt if a simple formation like that
would work against Minato Sensei.

70
00:04:15,426 --> 00:04:16,298
Just do it!

71
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,893
I guess it's worth a try.

72
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:22,746
It's better than doing nothing...

73
00:04:23,254 --> 00:04:25,590
Okay, I'm in!

74
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:31,552
Here we go!

75
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:32,602
– Yeah!
– Right!

76
00:04:36,596 --> 00:04:39,056
<i>I see only one opening
with Minato Sensei.</i>

77
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:43,648
<i>If I use these two to trap him,
we have a chance!</i>

78
00:04:49,948 --> 00:04:51,658
Okay, let's start

79
00:05:01,141 --> 00:05:03,101
<i>That wasn't teamwork.</i>

80
00:05:03,611 --> 00:05:05,907
<i>Back then, if only
Minato Sensei had seen</i>

81
00:05:05,932 --> 00:05:09,060
<i>that something was missing
in our teamwork...</i>

82
00:05:17,246 --> 00:05:19,255
Thanks for letting me get the bell first!

83
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:21,921
Looks like you're going
to be left behind!

84
00:05:22,384 --> 00:05:23,317
<i>No...</i>

85
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,388
<i>That wasn't...Minato Sensei's fault!</i>

86
00:05:32,446 --> 00:05:36,867
<i>I'm just trying to pass the buck,
and running away from the truth...</i>

87
00:05:38,032 --> 00:05:39,117
<i>That's why...</i>

88
00:05:41,527 --> 00:05:43,027
<i>with these guys...</i>

89
00:05:44,976 --> 00:05:47,312
<i>I'm going to make sure
their teamwork is solid.</i>

90
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,788
You're so clumsy...

91
00:05:52,533 --> 00:05:54,389
You're a disgrace.

92
00:05:54,766 --> 00:05:57,519
Huh?! Speak for yourself!

93
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:00,918
Damn it...Of all the luck...

94
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:04,006
To be lumped together
with guys like you.

95
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,566
Say that again!

96
00:06:07,265 --> 00:06:08,433
This is hilarious.

97
00:06:08,638 --> 00:06:10,890
You guys are so ridiculous!

98
00:06:13,292 --> 00:06:16,295
Say, I just had a great idea.

99
00:06:16,564 --> 00:06:20,610
What a coincidence. Me too.

100
00:06:21,523 --> 00:06:22,565
Me too!

101
00:06:22,905 --> 00:06:25,860
We don't want to give Sensei
a hard time...

102
00:06:25,994 --> 00:06:29,114
I agree! So I...

103
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,349
– will...
– decide...

104
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,693
- ...who drops out!
- ...who drops out!

105
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,645
<i>You guys.</i>

106
00:06:49,072 --> 00:06:49,676
Huh?

107
00:06:50,054 --> 00:06:52,055
You all fail!

108
00:06:56,578 --> 00:06:58,913
You're going back to the academy.

109
00:07:02,793 --> 00:07:05,421
<i>That frozen gaze...</i>

110
00:07:08,397 --> 00:07:13,485
<i>It's darkness itself...
His darkness hasn't been dispelled yet.</i>

111
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:20,695
<i>More time is necessary...</i>

112
00:07:40,512 --> 00:07:43,223
Rin...Obito...

113
00:07:43,993 --> 00:07:44,994
I know.

114
00:07:45,544 --> 00:07:49,798
I have no intention of making people
who don't work as a team into shinobi...

115
00:07:53,249 --> 00:07:56,085
No matter what anyone says...

116
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:02,856
Now then...

117
00:08:03,299 --> 00:08:06,176
How will this year turn out...?

118
00:08:17,232 --> 00:08:20,652
Keep it up and you'll end up back
at the academy!

119
00:08:22,388 --> 00:08:24,474
I'm in the spring of youth
at full power!

120
00:08:25,721 --> 00:08:27,023
No wonder he's a jonin.

121
00:08:27,705 --> 00:08:29,926
He dodges my taijutsu
with such ease.

122
00:08:30,188 --> 00:08:34,322
I thought graduating from
the academy made us genin.

123
00:08:34,808 --> 00:08:37,769
Failing now is too embarrassing!

124
00:08:40,477 --> 00:08:42,164
<i>Severe Leaf Hurricane!</i>

125
00:08:50,705 --> 00:08:51,797
Giving up already?

126
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,045
I'm not giving up!

127
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:57,161
My dream is to become a great shinobi
through taijutsu alone!

128
00:08:57,592 --> 00:09:00,765
I cannot...abandon my dream!

129
00:09:02,219 --> 00:09:03,512
That's ridiculous...

130
00:09:04,224 --> 00:09:05,228
But...

131
00:09:05,581 --> 00:09:08,397
I'm not throwing in the towel either!

132
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:09,649
That's right!

133
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,432
I'm that close to becoming
the kunoichi I've always admired!

134
00:09:14,408 --> 00:09:16,911
No way am I calling it quits!

135
00:09:19,382 --> 00:09:20,967
Now you're talking, guys!

136
00:09:21,501 --> 00:09:23,674
That's how youth should be!

137
00:09:24,993 --> 00:09:28,489
Even if you've used up
every ounce of your energy...

138
00:09:28,514 --> 00:09:30,177
suck it up and push through it!

139
00:09:31,449 --> 00:09:34,994
Hit me with all your might!

140
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:44,455
– Here we come!
– Here we come!

141
00:09:49,821 --> 00:09:52,198
The three of you...

142
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,285
...all pass!

143
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,388
Yes! I did it!

144
00:09:58,044 --> 00:10:00,000
I did it!

145
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:04,964
I-I can't breathe...!

146
00:10:12,023 --> 00:10:14,525
I'm so happy we all made it!

147
00:10:15,103 --> 00:10:17,981
I wasn't about to fail
after coming this far.

148
00:10:18,691 --> 00:10:19,692
But...

149
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,798
Thank goodness we didn't get
the sensei everyone talks about.

150
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:29,034
You mean that jonin who sent the three
before us back to the academy?

151
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,289
Uh-huh.

152
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,869
Luck has nothing to do
with real strength.

153
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,636
Those guys just weren't
good enough.

154
00:10:37,116 --> 00:10:38,993
That's not what I heard.

155
00:10:39,396 --> 00:10:44,359
It was about what's even more important
than a shinobi's strength or something...

156
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:46,313
And what is that?

157
00:10:46,873 --> 00:10:50,710
Is it some kind of
super-lethal-one-hit technique?

158
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:55,511
But who does he think he is
to make up his own criteria?

159
00:10:58,921 --> 00:10:59,922
<i>Kakashi...</i>

160
00:11:03,212 --> 00:11:05,465
Are you sure about this,
big brother?

161
00:11:05,983 --> 00:11:08,652
Maybe we shouldn't eat
the bento lunches...

162
00:11:09,382 --> 00:11:13,553
Look, have I ever been wrong?

163
00:11:23,743 --> 00:11:26,579
But Kakashi Sensei's not here.

164
00:11:27,177 --> 00:11:28,345
Quit nitpicking!

165
00:11:28,825 --> 00:11:32,287
You two, just listen and follow the rules!

166
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,641
Kakashi Sensei...!

167
00:11:56,183 --> 00:12:00,562
I've failed, but my kid brothers
followed the rules!

168
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:02,601
The three of you...

169
00:12:04,401 --> 00:12:06,570
Each of you obeyed my orders.

170
00:12:07,823 --> 00:12:08,824
You stuck to the rules.

171
00:12:09,627 --> 00:12:14,173
But you didn't follow what
is most important to a shinobi...

172
00:12:15,197 --> 00:12:16,202
What is that?!

173
00:12:16,227 --> 00:12:17,478
You grey-haired...!

174
00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:23,921
You're all going back to
the academy to figure it out.

175
00:12:28,855 --> 00:12:30,954
Passed on the Chunin Exams?

176
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,401
That's unusually cautious of you, Guy.

177
00:12:35,495 --> 00:12:36,496
Yeah...

178
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,552
Huh? The Chunin Exams?

179
00:12:42,403 --> 00:12:43,404
Yes.

180
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,307
The way the system works is,
if you complete over eight missions...

181
00:12:46,675 --> 00:12:49,220
you qualify to participate
in the Chunin Exams.

182
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:53,930
There haven't been rookies
in the Chunin Exams lately...

183
00:12:54,698 --> 00:12:56,408
Would you like to go for it?

184
00:12:56,932 --> 00:12:57,933
Uh...!

185
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,521
Huh? What's wrong, Lee?

186
00:13:02,178 --> 00:13:08,059
Well...I'd like to test myself
to see how strong I am...

187
00:13:09,287 --> 00:13:10,747
I do have that desire...

188
00:13:11,549 --> 00:13:12,232
But...

189
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,909
But what?

190
00:13:14,616 --> 00:13:17,772
I don't deserve to take the test
at my present level.

191
00:13:17,986 --> 00:13:20,196
I know my own ability best!

192
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,344
What about you, Neji?

193
00:13:25,192 --> 00:13:26,443
I'll pass on it too.

194
00:13:26,988 --> 00:13:27,948
Huh?

195
00:13:28,229 --> 00:13:31,107
Neji, you'd make it to chunin
in no time!

196
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,218
That's why there's no point
in rushing.

197
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,069
I see. And you, Tenten?

198
00:13:37,637 --> 00:13:39,084
Then I'll pass too!

199
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:43,765
Let's train hard and take
the next exams together!

200
00:13:44,218 --> 00:13:45,219
You guys!

201
00:13:45,485 --> 00:13:47,028
<i>You guys...</i>

202
00:13:50,022 --> 00:13:54,693
Having students like you
makes me very happy!

203
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,448
Dumplings! Another order
of dumplings, please!

204
00:14:00,094 --> 00:14:01,134
Coming right up!

205
00:14:01,555 --> 00:14:04,813
I don't get it...
But this is so like you.

206
00:14:05,394 --> 00:14:10,482
By the way, what's it like to be
in charge of fresh academy graduates?

207
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,798
That's right. This is your first time.

208
00:14:15,511 --> 00:14:16,297
Hmm?

209
00:14:16,532 --> 00:14:17,741
Hey, Kakashi!

210
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:21,443
Come join us for some
sweet dumplings!

211
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:28,694
What's with him?

212
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:32,985
His eyes are as cold as ever...
like he never left the ANBU.

213
00:14:33,696 --> 00:14:36,407
He failed every one of them again.

214
00:14:36,853 --> 00:14:38,768
That's not such a big deal.

215
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:44,751
No, but the darkness in
Kakashi's heart is a problem.

216
00:14:45,857 --> 00:14:47,483
He's still carrying that around...

217
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:52,426
They were my classmates too.
And I grieved as well, but...

218
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,407
You've got to get over it...

219
00:14:56,285 --> 00:14:57,286
I know...

220
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:04,119
I knew that the depressing atmosphere of
the ANBU would turn him more sullen.

221
00:15:05,285 --> 00:15:06,096
Lord Third!

222
00:15:06,254 --> 00:15:08,757
The ANBU isn't for someone
like Kakashi!

223
00:15:09,387 --> 00:15:12,304
I know it isn't my place
to say this, Lord Third!

224
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,044
But...

225
00:15:14,443 --> 00:15:18,613
We've lost too many of our friends...!

226
00:15:19,787 --> 00:15:23,833
Watching Kakashi...
It's as though he's in a hurry to die...

227
00:15:24,197 --> 00:15:28,952
That's why...we came up with this idea
to put him in charge of the genin...

228
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:33,742
If he has subordinates to look after,
we're sure he'll change...

229
00:15:34,481 --> 00:15:37,859
Hmm...You think so too?

230
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,495
So then...?!

231
00:15:42,057 --> 00:15:44,746
Maybe we shouldn't have interfered...

232
00:15:45,784 --> 00:15:48,806
We each thought that rather
than being in the ANBU,

233
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:55,256
being in charge of young future shinobi
held more promise for him, but...

234
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:56,706
Lord Third!

235
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:57,936
Lord Third?

236
00:15:59,008 --> 00:16:00,009
Lord Third?!

237
00:16:01,301 --> 00:16:04,179
At ease, finish your tea.

238
00:16:05,066 --> 00:16:07,199
In fact, I'll have a cup too.

239
00:16:14,065 --> 00:16:15,274
I see...

240
00:16:17,914 --> 00:16:19,253
What's so funny?

241
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:22,194
You always treat us like we're kids...

242
00:16:22,219 --> 00:16:22,786
Asuma!

243
00:16:23,352 --> 00:16:26,124
Oh...Forgive me for laughing.

244
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:30,304
I must admit that I do treat you
like children.

245
00:16:39,737 --> 00:16:40,821
<i>Minato Sensei...</i>

246
00:16:41,607 --> 00:16:43,793
<i>Is my way wrong...?</i>

247
00:16:47,218 --> 00:16:49,303
– Kakashi Sensei!
– Kakashi Sensei!

248
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:50,630
Y-Yes?

249
00:16:50,963 --> 00:16:52,600
– Good morning, sir!
– Good morning, sir!

250
00:16:56,401 --> 00:16:57,444
Kakashi Sensei!

251
00:16:57,858 --> 00:17:01,622
We're in charge of
academy discipline now!

252
00:17:02,196 --> 00:17:04,907
We realized everything starts
with a proper greeting!

253
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:08,213
That greeting was spot on!

254
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,823
Keep it up!

255
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:12,431
– Yes!
– Yes!

256
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:13,783
Please excuse us!

257
00:17:14,197 --> 00:17:15,323
– Excuse us!
– Excuse us!

258
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,528
– Excuse us!
– Excuse us!

259
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:23,407
<i>Who cares about greetings?
Let's get started.</i>

260
00:17:24,254 --> 00:17:25,797
<i>Those guys, huh...</i>

261
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,415
It's Kakashi Sensei!

262
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:31,628
It's you!

263
00:17:36,414 --> 00:17:38,082
– Thank you very much!
– Thank you very much!

264
00:17:38,178 --> 00:17:39,721
W-What?!

265
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:44,523
Thank you for failing
us in that practice...

266
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:46,785
we were able to change!

267
00:17:47,728 --> 00:17:48,315
Huh?

268
00:17:48,771 --> 00:17:51,316
We always depended
on our big brother...

269
00:17:51,596 --> 00:17:53,751
and never stood up for ourselves...

270
00:17:54,367 --> 00:17:58,704
Actually, that time, we wanted to
share our lunch with him!

271
00:17:59,321 --> 00:18:03,056
After the practice, we realized
that we should've spoken up

272
00:18:03,081 --> 00:18:05,024
and told you how we felt. Right?

273
00:18:05,287 --> 00:18:05,871
Yeah...

274
00:18:06,364 --> 00:18:11,744
I thought I was helping them,
but I was stifling them instead.

275
00:18:12,431 --> 00:18:14,267
I learned a lesson too.

276
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:16,971
– And so...!
– And so...!

277
00:18:17,355 --> 00:18:20,795
– We're so grateful to you, Kakashi Sensei!
– We're so grateful to you, Kakashi Sensei!

278
00:18:23,142 --> 00:18:25,769
<i>Grateful...to me...?</i>

279
00:18:26,454 --> 00:18:29,258
A teacher trains his students...

280
00:18:29,578 --> 00:18:31,826
and at the same time,
learns from them.

281
00:18:32,292 --> 00:18:36,795
Only through mutual respect
and growth...

282
00:18:37,286 --> 00:18:40,144
can you foster
a true teacher-pupil relationship.

283
00:18:40,497 --> 00:18:46,002
It is my hope that you will nurture
such a relationship with your pupils.

284
00:18:46,907 --> 00:18:50,327
Of course, I wish it for Kakashi as well.

285
00:18:51,189 --> 00:18:52,022
Lord Third!

286
00:18:52,454 --> 00:18:53,830
Is that...

287
00:18:54,752 --> 00:18:57,702
Oh...it's still very secret.

288
00:18:58,494 --> 00:19:01,263
But this is the list of
academy graduates

289
00:19:01,288 --> 00:19:03,134
who will be under Kakashi's tutelage.

290
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:06,715
I'm sure it's a group of
highly individualistic kids.

291
00:19:13,327 --> 00:19:17,140
Regarding the next group of genin
that you'll be in charge of...

292
00:19:17,235 --> 00:19:18,695
Me? Again?

293
00:19:19,053 --> 00:19:21,055
Now don't look so upset.

294
00:19:21,796 --> 00:19:23,547
Guy has already formed his squad

295
00:19:23,572 --> 00:19:25,907
and has gone out on missions
with them.

296
00:19:26,271 --> 00:19:29,608
Aren't you eager to set out with
your own apprentices?

297
00:19:30,428 --> 00:19:31,248
Well...

298
00:19:31,855 --> 00:19:37,778
I'm sure this new batch of genin
will hold your interest.

299
00:19:42,413 --> 00:19:43,229
Where are we?

300
00:19:44,358 --> 00:19:46,235
This is Naruto Uzumaki's house.

301
00:19:47,402 --> 00:19:48,904
Lord Fourth's orphan.

302
00:19:50,405 --> 00:19:51,698
So that child is a genin.

303
00:19:53,713 --> 00:19:56,007
Are you a little interested now?

304
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:00,844
So this is where Naruto lives.

305
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:02,971
Yes.

306
00:20:09,424 --> 00:20:13,387
<i>This milk is way past
its expiration date.</i>

307
00:20:17,557 --> 00:20:21,103
<i>Minato Sensei was so meticulous.
I can't believe this is his son.</i>

308
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,824
He's a bit of a fool,

309
00:20:23,962 --> 00:20:26,339
but it would be best if
you looked after him.

310
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,334
You have good instincts.

311
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,601
That Uchiha boy, Sasuke, is
also on your squad.

312
00:20:36,807 --> 00:20:38,141
I wish you the best of luck.

313
00:20:39,588 --> 00:20:40,301
Understood.

314
00:20:41,475 --> 00:20:44,145
<i>What have I gotten myself into?</i>

315
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,812
Next up is a kunoichi...

316
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:00,834
Welcome, Lord Third!
And Kakashi Sensei as well!

317
00:21:00,899 --> 00:21:03,137
Our Sakura, will be under
your supervision!

318
00:21:03,488 --> 00:21:05,156
Come in and have some tea!

319
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:07,016
I'll hurry and get it rea-tea!

320
00:21:09,481 --> 00:21:10,815
I couldn't resist saying that!

321
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,044
Oh, stop! You're so silly!

322
00:21:18,265 --> 00:21:21,018
I'm here unofficially.

323
00:21:21,425 --> 00:21:24,224
So if I accept an invitation for tea
at a student's home,

324
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:27,961
other parents might frown upon it.

325
00:21:28,103 --> 00:21:30,397
Oh, please don't be so formal.

326
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:31,586
Yes! Thanks to you,

327
00:21:31,611 --> 00:21:34,801
we live in peace and have nothing
to worry about, Lord Hokage!

328
00:21:35,114 --> 00:21:37,671
No one would dare complain.

329
00:21:37,999 --> 00:21:39,405
Please, you too, Kakashi Sensei!

330
00:21:39,971 --> 00:21:43,368
After all, you're going to be
our daughter's sensei.

331
00:21:43,643 --> 00:21:45,395
So please come in!

332
00:21:45,668 --> 00:21:47,795
<i>This is really not looking good...</i>

333
00:21:53,362 --> 00:21:56,235
The last up one is...
Sasuke Uchiha's house.

334
00:22:02,232 --> 00:22:06,486
At one time, the Uchiha lived in
a special autonomous district.

335
00:22:06,771 --> 00:22:08,424
Now, only Sasuke remains...

336
00:22:13,068 --> 00:22:17,466
Sasuke's father Fugaku Uchiha
was very strict.

337
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:19,801
Seems the boy is very disciplined.

338
00:22:24,288 --> 00:22:27,299
His older brother Itachi was
very meticulous as well.

339
00:22:27,896 --> 00:22:29,523
Yes, I remember.

340
00:22:29,701 --> 00:22:32,495
I assigned him under you.

341
00:22:33,293 --> 00:22:35,159
Look after the younger one as well

342
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:39,205
I'm asking in place of
their father, Fugaku.

343
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:43,203
I didn't have to teach Itachi a thing.

344
00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:47,379
His Sharingan was far
more effective than mine.

345
00:22:49,555 --> 00:22:53,997
Regardless, you are the only Leaf shinobi
who possesses a Sharingan now.

346
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:58,284
We don't know yet if Sasuke
will be able to activate his...

347
00:22:58,683 --> 00:23:01,689
but if he does,
you must be there for him.

348
00:23:02,187 --> 00:23:02,808
Yes...

349
00:23:09,735 --> 00:23:11,246
<i>Obito, you—!</i>

350
00:23:20,715 --> 00:23:21,716
<i>This is where...</i>

351
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:24,424
<i>I'll protect my friends!</i>

352
00:23:26,485 --> 00:23:27,486
<i>Obito...</i>

353
00:23:34,707 --> 00:23:35,958
<i>Kakashi...</i>

354
00:23:53,857 --> 00:23:54,899
<i>Rin...</i>

355
00:23:57,713 --> 00:24:00,299
The shadow of tragedy
trails this eye.

356
00:24:02,818 --> 00:24:06,613
It might be best not to activate
the Sharingan at all.

357
00:24:07,584 --> 00:24:08,585
But...

358
00:24:10,587 --> 00:24:13,548
But for better or for worse,

359
00:24:14,425 --> 00:24:17,514
this eye holds a key into how
I feel about my comrades.

360
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,595
If one thinks that there is a downside

361
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,118
to having these kinds of feelings...
that it attracts tragedy...

362
00:24:22,687 --> 00:24:25,455
then I must see to it that
they treasure their comrades,

363
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,774
in order to prevent that
from happening.

364
00:24:31,149 --> 00:24:35,319
It seems your judging criteria
remains unchanged this year.

365
00:24:39,413 --> 00:24:40,186
<i>Still...</i>

366
00:24:40,516 --> 00:24:42,935
<i>This room is quite a contrast
from Naruto's.</i>

367
00:24:46,431 --> 00:24:47,849
We've been waiting for you.

368
00:24:48,022 --> 00:24:51,442
It should not have taken you this long
to designate team leaders.

369
00:24:55,774 --> 00:24:59,527
I was showing Naruto's apartment
to Kakashi.

370
00:25:00,347 --> 00:25:01,473
About that...

371
00:25:01,879 --> 00:25:05,341
Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha
are on the same team?!

372
00:25:05,449 --> 00:25:08,618
Furthermore, I hear that you've placed
Kakashi Hatake in charge of them.

373
00:25:09,312 --> 00:25:11,998
Yes. I think he's right for the job.

374
00:25:12,238 --> 00:25:14,881
It doesn't matter if
he's right for the job!

375
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:16,878
What do you plan to do if
Naruto is on a mission

376
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:21,956
and that thing inside of him goes wild?

377
00:25:22,468 --> 00:25:23,969
That's not all.

378
00:25:24,553 --> 00:25:27,273
There is the danger that he might
be the target of outsiders as well.

379
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,669
Shouldn't we confine Naruto
within the village?

380
00:25:32,476 --> 00:25:35,885
Furthermore, you teamed Naruto up
with Sasuke.

381
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:46,654
<i>Are you plotting to give the Uchiha
control over the Nine-Tails?</i>

382
00:25:47,724 --> 00:25:50,101
<i>Good idea, Hiruzen.</i>

383
00:25:52,764 --> 00:25:58,243
Next is Team 7. Sakura Haruno.
Naruto Uzumaki!

384
00:25:58,509 --> 00:25:59,738
All right!

385
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:01,810
And Sasuke Uchiha.

386
00:26:02,121 --> 00:26:03,563
Cha!

387
00:26:04,008 --> 00:26:05,260
Iruka Sensei!

388
00:26:05,568 --> 00:26:10,225
I'm totally brilliant! So why am I
on the same team as him?!

389
00:26:10,801 --> 00:26:15,192
Sasuke graduated with
the best scores of all 27 graduates.

390
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,007
Naruto, you were the worst!

391
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:23,089
This is just the result of our effort
to balance the teams.

392
00:26:27,642 --> 00:26:31,813
Try not to get in the way, loser!

393
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:34,664
What was that?!

394
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:36,430
Jeez, Naruto!

395
00:26:36,927 --> 00:26:38,429
Cut it out!

396
00:26:39,549 --> 00:26:43,563
Ouch! Ow ow ow!
Ouch, stop Sakura! Stop!

397
00:27:16,586 --> 00:27:18,922
<i>So that one was Naruto.</i>

398
00:27:21,794 --> 00:27:25,798
Sakura, there's something
I want to ask you.

399
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:26,716
Huh?

400
00:27:26,982 --> 00:27:30,319
Oh! Well...What do you think of Naruto?

401
00:27:30,703 --> 00:27:31,704
Naruto?

402
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:37,339
He's always interfering with my love life.

403
00:27:38,503 --> 00:27:41,006
He enjoys making me suffer.

404
00:27:42,465 --> 00:27:45,510
Naruto doesn't understand
anything about me.

405
00:27:45,926 --> 00:27:46,969
He's just annoying.

406
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:54,234
I just...want you to accept me.

407
00:27:55,379 --> 00:27:57,047
I'm desperate.

408
00:27:58,148 --> 00:28:01,146
I'd do anything for you to accept me.

409
00:28:02,394 --> 00:28:04,354
That's because I love you, Sasuke.

410
00:28:06,146 --> 00:28:08,960
<i>S-Sakura...I...</i>

411
00:28:20,292 --> 00:28:21,252
Sasuke?

412
00:28:21,682 --> 00:28:23,475
I-I'll be right back.

413
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:27,384
<i>That look on his face...</i>

414
00:28:29,706 --> 00:28:31,625
<i>I'll bet he drank it.</i>

415
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:36,549
<i>I won't be able to make it!</i>

416
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:40,876
That was close.

417
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:42,012
Oh!

418
00:28:42,548 --> 00:28:46,635
Honestly! You're so shy, Sasuke.

419
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:51,357
Are you ready now? I'm all ready!

420
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,906
It's almost time.
Where is Naruto?

421
00:28:56,738 --> 00:28:59,532
Oh there you go again,
changing the subject like that.

422
00:28:59,949 --> 00:29:01,992
Never mind Naruto!

423
00:29:02,368 --> 00:29:04,871
He's always picking fights with you!

424
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:08,708
It's probably because
he's never been raised properly!

425
00:29:09,688 --> 00:29:12,482
He doesn't have any parents, you know!

426
00:29:13,095 --> 00:29:15,972
That's why he always gets
to do whatever he wants!

427
00:29:16,502 --> 00:29:19,922
If I tried to do that,
my parents would get mad at me!

428
00:29:20,823 --> 00:29:25,828
It's so nice to be alone!
You don't have parents to pester you.

429
00:29:26,071 --> 00:29:28,663
That's why he gets to be
as selfish as he is.

430
00:29:29,864 --> 00:29:30,800
Loneliness...

431
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:31,706
Huh?

432
00:29:32,152 --> 00:29:35,039
It's far worse than feeling sad
because your parents scolded you!

433
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,874
Wh-What's wrong?
What's this about?

434
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:45,107
You're annoying.

435
00:29:56,589 --> 00:29:57,674
Hey!

436
00:29:59,148 --> 00:30:00,695
Why are you here?!

437
00:30:01,135 --> 00:30:04,097
We ninja have something called
an Escape Jutsu.

438
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,864
Remember that, loser.

439
00:30:07,084 --> 00:30:09,920
Why...you...

440
00:30:24,995 --> 00:30:25,996
<i>Sakura?</i>

441
00:30:27,155 --> 00:30:29,991
<i>Sasuke's words seem to have
hurt her pretty badly.</i>

442
00:30:31,993 --> 00:30:34,704
<i>I wonder if this is what Naruto felt like.</i>

443
00:30:36,348 --> 00:30:39,315
<i>Sakura's really depressed.</i>

444
00:30:41,426 --> 00:30:42,916
<i>Sasuke!</i>

445
00:30:45,512 --> 00:30:48,098
<i>Naruto...He doesn't understand at all.</i>

446
00:30:49,127 --> 00:30:51,698
Hey, Sasuke!

447
00:30:59,402 --> 00:31:02,488
You said something mean
to Sakura, didn't you?!

448
00:31:04,465 --> 00:31:05,336
Not really.

449
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,868
Liar! If you didn't, there's no way
that she'd get that depressed!

450
00:31:12,498 --> 00:31:18,713
I hate to admit it, but Sakura's desperate
to be accepted by you!

451
00:31:20,601 --> 00:31:21,602
Like I'd care.

452
00:31:21,949 --> 00:31:24,702
Wh-What?!

453
00:31:26,115 --> 00:31:27,803
Bastard!

454
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:33,279
<i>Oh, my...There they go.</i>

455
00:31:34,195 --> 00:31:35,280
What are you doing?

456
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:41,524
I'm going to hit you
for Sakura's sake.

457
00:31:42,193 --> 00:31:43,652
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

458
00:31:56,803 --> 00:31:59,014
What's wrong?
Aren't you going to come at me?

459
00:32:02,204 --> 00:32:04,467
What?! Shoot! Let go!

460
00:32:04,624 --> 00:32:07,222
All right! You fell for it!

461
00:32:07,802 --> 00:32:09,363
Take this!

462
00:32:09,388 --> 00:32:10,395
You've got the wrong one!

463
00:32:15,815 --> 00:32:17,855
Hey, don't you think that was
a little too much?

464
00:32:19,298 --> 00:32:20,917
I got hasty.

465
00:32:20,962 --> 00:32:23,172
Wait a minute,
how did you get there?!

466
00:32:24,431 --> 00:32:25,363
Hey! Get back here!

467
00:32:27,508 --> 00:32:29,208
You're annoying too.

468
00:32:40,796 --> 00:32:44,633
<i>Damn it...I've got to do something
about Sasuke's quick movements.</i>

469
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:47,723
<i>In that case,
I'll use my trump card!</i>

470
00:32:50,903 --> 00:32:52,960
<i>That sign...
Another Shadow Clone Jutsu?</i>

471
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:55,724
<i>Sexy Jutsu!</i>

472
00:32:59,584 --> 00:33:01,301
Sasuke!

473
00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:07,447
<i>Sasuke is so shocked he's speechless!</i>

474
00:33:07,767 --> 00:33:09,400
I've got you!

475
00:33:11,402 --> 00:33:12,987
That hurts!

476
00:33:14,515 --> 00:33:18,728
Ow ow ow...ow!

477
00:33:19,552 --> 00:33:21,744
Hey, Sasuke! We're not finished yet!

478
00:33:21,769 --> 00:33:22,522
Naruto!

479
00:33:22,547 --> 00:33:24,089
Huh? Sakura...

480
00:33:24,477 --> 00:33:25,728
We're meeting in the classroom.

481
00:33:26,109 --> 00:33:28,069
Oh...Wait up.

482
00:33:32,407 --> 00:33:36,244
<i>They're amusing,
but they lack teamwork.</i>

483
00:33:39,227 --> 00:33:42,432
<i>I don't think they can pass my test.</i>

484
00:33:46,017 --> 00:33:47,018
Why?

485
00:33:47,373 --> 00:33:48,374
Why what?

486
00:33:48,988 --> 00:33:51,991
Why did you put me in charge
of those three?

487
00:33:55,942 --> 00:34:02,365
Well, there's a hopeless fool,
a skilled protégé and a clever kunoichi...

488
00:34:03,285 --> 00:34:05,599
I'd say it's much like
Minato's old team.

489
00:34:06,402 --> 00:34:08,279
S-So you chose me on purpose?!

490
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,856
Listen Kakashi, I am the Hokage.

491
00:34:12,423 --> 00:34:14,392
I would never base
my personnel decisions

492
00:34:14,417 --> 00:34:15,543
on personal preference!

493
00:34:15,904 --> 00:34:17,313
It's all about the right man
for the right job...

494
00:34:17,338 --> 00:34:20,508
I carefully consider each of
these assignments...

495
00:34:21,657 --> 00:34:25,714
Separately from what the teachers
at the Academy believe.

496
00:34:26,334 --> 00:34:28,711
Sasuke and Naruto will be
on the same squad?

497
00:34:29,204 --> 00:34:30,057
That's brilliant!

498
00:34:30,472 --> 00:34:33,587
Sasuke graduated at the top of
his class out of 27 students...

499
00:34:34,106 --> 00:34:35,613
Whereas Naruto was last in class.

500
00:34:36,223 --> 00:34:38,851
It seems you did that to keep
the squad balanced!

501
00:34:43,464 --> 00:34:45,884
These are times when
a squad's composition greatly affects

502
00:34:46,523 --> 00:34:50,633
shinobi and their actions,
and subsequently, their success rate.

503
00:34:50,658 --> 00:34:54,463
It is the duty of those who govern

504
00:34:54,488 --> 00:34:56,891
to maintain special teams that
possess a variety of skills.

505
00:34:58,391 --> 00:35:01,408
For example, Guy's team that
was formed last year.

506
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,130
It certainly doesn't
have the kind of balance

507
00:35:05,155 --> 00:35:06,755
the instructors at
the Academy recommend.

508
00:35:07,112 --> 00:35:10,615
It's a squad that specializes largely
in taijutsu.

509
00:35:11,445 --> 00:35:12,187
You're right.

510
00:35:12,447 --> 00:35:15,242
This year, they have really
come into their own.

511
00:35:17,471 --> 00:35:18,928
I also intend to organize

512
00:35:18,953 --> 00:35:21,873
specialty military squads
that utilize Secret ninjutsu.

513
00:35:24,101 --> 00:35:25,393
From that perspective,

514
00:35:25,628 --> 00:35:27,985
Naruto is the Jinchuriki
of the Nine-Tails...

515
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:32,014
and Sasuke has the potential
to activate the Sharingan...

516
00:35:32,705 --> 00:35:33,873
As I mentioned earlier,

517
00:35:34,498 --> 00:35:39,003
you are the only one who can
advise Sasuke with his Sharingan.

518
00:35:41,201 --> 00:35:43,098
<i>Looking ahead, it is imperative</i>

519
00:35:43,123 --> 00:35:48,300
<i>that Sasuke awaken his Sharingan
that can control the Nine-Tails...</i>

520
00:35:48,866 --> 00:35:51,917
<i>That night's tragedy
must never happen again.</i>

521
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,577
I understand that those two are special.

522
00:35:55,389 --> 00:35:57,475
But what about the girl Sakura?

523
00:35:58,868 --> 00:36:03,432
Well, I believe she has
the potential to be a good kunoichi.

524
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:07,293
Right now, she's average. However...

525
00:36:20,107 --> 00:36:21,859
<i>Shuriken Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

526
00:36:24,408 --> 00:36:28,329
<i>He's already picked up
one of my jutsu!</i>

527
00:36:31,257 --> 00:36:32,675
Good one, Orochimaru!

528
00:36:38,267 --> 00:36:39,317
I can do that too!

529
00:36:39,775 --> 00:36:42,028
What? You too, Jiraiya?

530
00:36:48,364 --> 00:36:50,199
<i>Shu...Shuriken...</i>

531
00:36:51,158 --> 00:36:53,077
<i>Whatever Jutsu...!</i>

532
00:36:57,776 --> 00:37:00,196
Talent attracts people...

533
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,490
Men notice women...

534
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,566
And rivalry matures both...

535
00:37:04,591 --> 00:37:06,129
So they say.

536
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,158
Go get 'em!

537
00:37:09,183 --> 00:37:10,105
Do it!

538
00:37:15,056 --> 00:37:18,351
So you've even considered how
the squad will develop?

539
00:37:18,873 --> 00:37:20,291
That's right.

540
00:37:23,216 --> 00:37:24,318
<i>Without a doubt...</i>

541
00:37:24,818 --> 00:37:28,405
<i>Obito was desperate for Rin
to acknowledge him.</i>

542
00:37:29,711 --> 00:37:30,380
<i>But...</i>

543
00:37:33,003 --> 00:37:34,843
I understand your logic
behind this Lord Third.

544
00:37:35,365 --> 00:37:40,499
But...I failed twice with squads
that you organized.

545
00:37:41,951 --> 00:37:45,747
I don't think I'm cut out
to be a jonin leader.

546
00:37:46,299 --> 00:37:49,302
Did you fail them because of
your own personal feelings?

547
00:37:49,884 --> 00:37:50,604
No...

548
00:37:52,445 --> 00:37:54,650
It was unfortunate for them.

549
00:37:54,985 --> 00:37:57,000
But this is the strict world of shinobi.

550
00:37:57,164 --> 00:38:00,529
It's better that they learn this
when they're young.

551
00:38:00,948 --> 00:38:05,067
Ultimately, this will prove to be
a valuable lesson for them.

552
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:09,052
But it wasn't planned.
It just happened to work out.

553
00:38:09,115 --> 00:38:10,405
Perhaps.

554
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:14,295
But I had faith that
it would work out.

555
00:38:14,753 --> 00:38:17,047
I trusted you.

556
00:38:17,756 --> 00:38:18,799
Lord Hiruzen...

557
00:38:19,337 --> 00:38:21,255
It was the same with Minato too.

558
00:38:21,847 --> 00:38:22,848
Minato Sensei?

559
00:38:28,084 --> 00:38:30,295
Judging from only
the practice reports,

560
00:38:30,628 --> 00:38:33,935
it would seem that
Kakashi acted arbitrarily.

561
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,117
Kakashi is leagues ahead
of the other graduates

562
00:38:36,142 --> 00:38:38,311
in terms of skill and intelligence.

563
00:38:39,171 --> 00:38:42,341
It's exciting just thinking about
this genin's development.

564
00:38:43,132 --> 00:38:47,553
Perhaps due to the incident
with Sakumo, he's very headstrong.

565
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:52,037
But I have faith that he'll realize
the importance of teamwork.

566
00:38:53,051 --> 00:38:54,261
Faith, huh?

567
00:38:55,127 --> 00:38:56,921
Yes, you're right.

568
00:38:57,999 --> 00:39:01,794
I shall have faith in your faith.

569
00:39:04,614 --> 00:39:06,492
<i>Minato Sensei knew all along</i>

570
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,408
<i>about my selfish and
shallow strategy.</i>

571
00:39:10,392 --> 00:39:13,909
<i>But he had faith that one day,
I would realize it...</i>

572
00:39:18,508 --> 00:39:20,811
To believe in one's student
and to watch over them...

573
00:39:20,836 --> 00:39:23,381
is also part of being a teacher.

574
00:39:35,221 --> 00:39:40,117
<i>Father...I spent my life denying you...</i>

575
00:39:41,761 --> 00:39:45,056
<i>I believe that the White Fang
was a true hero.</i>

576
00:39:47,858 --> 00:39:50,277
<i>Sure, in the world of ninja,</i>

577
00:39:50,534 --> 00:39:54,205
<i>one who breaks the rules and
regulations is regarded as trash.</i>

578
00:39:55,084 --> 00:40:01,299
<i>But...those who abandon their comrades
are worse than trash!</i>

579
00:40:16,611 --> 00:40:17,388
<i>But...</i>

580
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:24,469
<i>I can't repeat that tragedy again
with a new generation.</i>

581
00:40:35,819 --> 00:40:37,946
Are you going to be our Sensei?

582
00:40:38,182 --> 00:40:39,721
I'm Naruto Uzumaki!

583
00:40:39,746 --> 00:40:41,372
And I'm going to be the Hokage!

584
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:47,091
Shikamaru Nara, Choji Akimichi,
Ino Yamanaka!

585
00:40:47,469 --> 00:40:48,207
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

586
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:52,259
I'm the jonin leader of
your squad, Asuma Sarutobi.

587
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,412
We're going to have a meeting now.

588
00:40:55,457 --> 00:40:56,066
Follow me.

589
00:40:58,026 --> 00:40:58,837
See ya!

590
00:40:59,137 --> 00:40:59,918
So long!

591
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,017
See you again, Sasuke!

592
00:41:02,558 --> 00:41:04,167
Get lost, Ino Pig!

593
00:41:06,396 --> 00:41:09,816
What? He's their sensei?

594
00:41:10,325 --> 00:41:12,948
Well, the next one will be ours!

595
00:41:13,288 --> 00:41:16,374
Nope, it'll be our sensei next!

596
00:41:16,627 --> 00:41:17,836
Right, Akamaru?

597
00:41:24,027 --> 00:41:27,781
Kiba Inuzuka, Shino Aburame,
Hinata Hyuga...

598
00:41:29,399 --> 00:41:32,013
I'm Yuhi Kurenai and
I'll be your leader.

599
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:33,737
Nice to meet you all.

600
00:41:37,007 --> 00:41:40,110
The loser squad gets
a loser sensei too!

601
00:41:45,963 --> 00:41:47,176
- He's late!
- He's late!

602
00:41:53,205 --> 00:41:55,707
Have you been waiting for me, Tenzo?

603
00:41:59,775 --> 00:42:02,612
Stop calling me "Tenzo," Senpai.

604
00:42:03,525 --> 00:42:06,319
Then drop the "senpai."

605
00:42:06,956 --> 00:42:08,666
You'll always be my senpai.

606
00:42:09,131 --> 00:42:12,384
That will never change,
even if you're no longer ANBU.

607
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,186
So what do you want?

608
00:42:14,492 --> 00:42:15,817
I've heard the rumors

609
00:42:15,973 --> 00:42:18,177
that it's been very difficult
trying find my replacement.

610
00:42:19,252 --> 00:42:22,992
Or did you come all this way
to laugh at me, the genin babysitter?

611
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:24,871
Not at all!

612
00:42:25,345 --> 00:42:27,197
But that was such a long time ago.

613
00:42:27,401 --> 00:42:29,317
You haven't changed a bit, Senpai.

614
00:42:30,537 --> 00:42:32,623
Sorry, but I'm busy today.

615
00:42:33,336 --> 00:42:35,046
I can't stand around and chat.

616
00:42:38,084 --> 00:42:41,504
It's way past the time you were
supposed to meet your genin.

617
00:42:43,536 --> 00:42:45,037
Well, see you later.

618
00:42:50,126 --> 00:42:54,088
"See you later," huh?
Maybe he did change a little.

619
00:42:55,043 --> 00:42:57,438
For someone who was fixated
on the past and present...

620
00:42:57,463 --> 00:42:59,131
to hear him say,
"see you later..."

621
00:43:14,305 --> 00:43:15,723
<i>A silly prank...</i>

622
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,364
<i>Still, if this prank was
the result of teamwork...</i>

623
00:43:21,441 --> 00:43:23,151
He fell for it!

624
00:43:23,528 --> 00:43:24,946
<i>So Naruto's the perp.</i>

625
00:43:25,604 --> 00:43:29,446
I'm so sorry, Sensei.
I tried to stop him, but Naruto...

626
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:32,876
<i>Sakura makes excuses and
tries to protect herself...</i>

627
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:36,482
<i>Sasuke minds his own business...</i>

628
00:43:36,775 --> 00:43:39,058
<i>He probably doesn't consider them
as comrades.</i>

629
00:43:39,879 --> 00:43:41,839
<i>There's not even a shred of teamwork...</i>

630
00:43:43,305 --> 00:43:45,223
There are two bells here.

631
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:48,329
Your task is to take these bells away
from me by noon.

632
00:43:49,225 --> 00:43:53,438
The one who fails to take
a bell gets no lunch.

633
00:43:54,773 --> 00:43:58,069
<i>This exercise is to try
to split the team.</i>

634
00:43:58,546 --> 00:43:59,663
<i>I hope you figure it out.</i>

635
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:04,179
And failing the exercise means
failing the mission.

636
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,717
In order words, at the very least,

637
00:44:05,854 --> 00:44:10,150
one of you will be returning
to the Academy.

638
00:44:12,985 --> 00:44:14,153
Let's get started.

639
00:44:14,584 --> 00:44:16,920
Ready...Start!

640
00:44:17,868 --> 00:44:20,037
<i>Considering the prank
in the classroom...</i>

641
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:22,885
<i>I doubt that they'll work
as a team to attack me.</i>

642
00:44:32,183 --> 00:44:33,184
<i>I knew it.</i>

643
00:44:37,982 --> 00:44:39,025
Well, guys!

644
00:44:40,443 --> 00:44:42,582
I'm going to give you
one more chance.

645
00:44:43,398 --> 00:44:46,902
However, the afternoon scramble
for the bells will be much more difficult.

646
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:49,353
If you accept the challenge,
eat your lunch.

647
00:44:49,524 --> 00:44:52,545
However, don't let Naruto eat.

648
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:53,070
Huh?

649
00:44:53,623 --> 00:44:55,048
That's your punishment
for breaking the rules

650
00:44:55,073 --> 00:44:56,825
and attempting to eat lunch alone.

651
00:44:57,418 --> 00:44:59,195
If you give Naruto any food,

652
00:44:59,579 --> 00:45:02,191
you will be
immediately disqualified.

653
00:45:04,228 --> 00:45:05,897
I am the law here.

654
00:45:06,675 --> 00:45:07,926
Understand?

655
00:45:18,185 --> 00:45:20,452
<i>Minato Sensei had faith in me...</i>

656
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:23,631
<i>So should I have faith in them too?</i>

657
00:45:25,321 --> 00:45:28,491
<i>But what if I'm wrong
to begin with?</i>

658
00:45:29,301 --> 00:45:32,304
<i>Don't you have any kindness
in your heart?</i>

659
00:45:32,732 --> 00:45:35,507
<i>All you ever think about are
rules, rules, rules! It's annoying!</i>

660
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:37,973
<i>That's right.</i>

661
00:45:38,784 --> 00:45:42,174
<i>I'm still trying to stick to my rules...</i>

662
00:45:43,133 --> 00:45:45,719
<i>Come on, let's go, Captain.</i>

663
00:45:50,243 --> 00:45:51,049
<i>Obito...</i>

664
00:45:51,854 --> 00:45:56,150
<i>For the sake of the team,
you walked over to me that day...</i>

665
00:45:57,264 --> 00:46:02,478
<i>If only I had accepted
the friendship you extended...</i>

666
00:46:04,001 --> 00:46:06,393
<i>If I had embraced
that little sign you gave me...</i>

667
00:46:07,291 --> 00:46:08,292
Here.

668
00:46:24,128 --> 00:46:26,213
<i>Obito, did you see that?</i>

669
00:46:27,552 --> 00:46:31,068
<i>I'll never forget you or Rin.</i>

670
00:46:34,693 --> 00:46:35,474
<i>Kakashi.</i>

671
00:46:36,637 --> 00:46:37,476
<i>Kakashi.</i>

672
00:46:38,836 --> 00:46:39,674
<i>Kakashi.</i>

673
00:46:53,301 --> 00:46:54,970
You!

674
00:46:57,110 --> 00:46:58,111
Pass.

675
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:04,104
<i>But I think I'm going to move forward
with some new comrades.</i>

676
00:47:04,773 --> 00:47:07,567
<i>Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura...</i>

677
00:47:08,303 --> 00:47:10,075
<i>I'm going to believe in you.</i>

678
00:47:10,834 --> 00:47:14,337
<i>And Obito, Rin...
I'll make a promise.</i>

679
00:47:15,318 --> 00:47:19,209
<i>I'll believe in my comrades
and I'll never let them die!</i>

680
00:47:19,765 --> 00:47:23,060
That ends the survival exercise.
You all pass.

681
00:47:23,434 --> 00:47:25,864
Squad Seven will start
its mission tomorrow!

682
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:32,536
Huh?! Hey, untie me!
