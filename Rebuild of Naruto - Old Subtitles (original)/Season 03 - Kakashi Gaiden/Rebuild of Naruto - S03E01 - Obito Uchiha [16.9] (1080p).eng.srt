1
00:00:03,294 --> 00:00:04,295
Obito!

2
00:00:04,847 --> 00:00:06,682
Rin is here to pick you up.

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:08,273
Sorry, sorry, Rin!

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,999
I can't wait to see
my great-grandchild's face, Obito.

5
00:00:13,692 --> 00:00:16,409
Grandma, I'm only five years old.

6
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:19,185
Come on, hurry,
it's going to start!

7
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:26,985
Wow! This is the kunai prize!

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,403
It's so cool!

9
00:00:29,577 --> 00:00:32,060
Okay, thank you very much!

10
00:00:32,346 --> 00:00:34,431
I wonder what kind of
ninjutsu is next?

11
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,538
If these are the opponents,
this is going to be a piece of cake.

12
00:00:42,604 --> 00:00:44,857
Number seven, Obito Uchiha!

13
00:00:45,198 --> 00:00:46,199
That's me!

14
00:00:47,713 --> 00:00:49,423
Go for it, Obito!

15
00:00:49,752 --> 00:00:52,255
What are you going
to show us, Obito?

16
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:55,238
I'm going to be doing
the Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!

17
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,768
Wow, impressive!

18
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,159
All right, let's get right to it!

19
00:00:59,384 --> 00:01:00,468
Here I go!

20
00:01:01,266 --> 00:01:02,370
<i>Fire Style:</i>

21
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,855
<i>Fireball Jutsu!</i>

22
00:01:10,858 --> 00:01:12,902
Six points! Seven points!
Seven points!

23
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,408
These are great numbers!

24
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,929
Obito Uchiha is in
the lead right now!

25
00:01:23,348 --> 00:01:24,725
That was great, Obito!

26
00:01:26,576 --> 00:01:31,623
I wasn't in top form today,
but I think it's a sure win for me.

27
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,980
All right, here's our final challenger!

28
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,472
Kakashi Hatake!

29
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,144
What are you doing to do
for us, Kakashi?

30
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:45,859
Well, how about
the Earth Style: Mud Wave?

31
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:49,234
Really? That jutsu requires
a considerable amount of chakra.

32
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,443
Are you sure about this?

33
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:53,611
Mud Wave? At our age?

34
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,151
<i>Earth Style: Mud Wave Jutsu!</i>

35
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,669
The judges all agree!
Perfect 10s!

36
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,255
The winner is Kakashi Hatake!

37
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,687
Too bad, Obito.

38
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,766
Kakashi...Hatake!

39
00:02:29,088 --> 00:02:30,583
You're late, Obito!

40
00:02:30,764 --> 00:02:32,182
Everyone's been waiting!

41
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,863
Sorry, sorry! On the way,
an old man was...

42
00:02:36,298 --> 00:02:37,340
<i>Kakashi!</i>

43
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:40,072
Kakashi's joining us from today!

44
00:02:40,232 --> 00:02:41,698
Let's play kick-the-can today!

45
00:02:42,617 --> 00:02:44,176
Sure! Let's play!

46
00:02:47,405 --> 00:02:48,907
Kakashi's the only one left.

47
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,735
Obito's such a fast runner.

48
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,132
Save us, Kakashi!

49
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,009
I'll catch him instantly!

50
00:02:57,949 --> 00:02:58,950
What—?!

51
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:00,913
Saving my friends, no matter what...

52
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:03,754
That's my Ninja Way.

53
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,810
Want me to be "it"?

54
00:03:20,043 --> 00:03:21,044
As if!

55
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,334
Obito was "it" the whole time.

56
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:32,145
But he couldn't catch Kakashi,
not even once...

57
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,713
Kakashi is amazing.

58
00:03:34,775 --> 00:03:36,360
Oh, Mom!

59
00:03:37,516 --> 00:03:39,518
Obito, I have to leave.

60
00:03:39,737 --> 00:03:41,281
Me too! Mom!

61
00:03:47,357 --> 00:03:49,359
I won again.

62
00:03:50,435 --> 00:03:52,389
But I'll praise you for one thing...

63
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:56,035
You're the only one until now
who never chickened out.

64
00:03:58,135 --> 00:03:59,219
You show off!

65
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:01,444
Hey, I was praising you.

66
00:04:04,395 --> 00:04:06,063
There's my dad! So long!

67
00:04:06,344 --> 00:04:08,054
Yeah...See you!

68
00:04:20,524 --> 00:04:21,691
Say, Grandma...

69
00:04:21,955 --> 00:04:24,472
Am I like my dad? Or my mom?

70
00:04:25,134 --> 00:04:28,595
Well, let's see...
I think both of them.

71
00:04:30,464 --> 00:04:33,717
You are alive because
of your parents.

72
00:04:34,336 --> 00:04:37,881
So you must honor them both
and work for the sake of others.

73
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:46,911
Oh man, oh man, oh man!
This is the one day I can't be late!

74
00:05:07,518 --> 00:05:09,770
It's the entrance ceremony
and you're already late.

75
00:05:11,553 --> 00:05:14,639
Someone like you has no business
being in the Academy.

76
00:05:15,109 --> 00:05:16,193
You'll never make it.

77
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,608
It's okay.

78
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,869
I got this for you.

79
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,734
For me?

80
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:28,036
Yes! Just submit this and
you'll be able to enroll.

81
00:05:28,503 --> 00:05:31,322
Thank you! You're a lifesaver!

82
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,668
Keep pampering him and
he'll never be cured of his tardiness.

83
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,438
Shut up! Do you wanna fight?

84
00:05:38,607 --> 00:05:39,534
Say that again!

85
00:05:39,585 --> 00:05:41,920
– What?
– It's your fault!

86
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,676
What did you say,
stupid Kakashi?

87
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,388
Kakashi Hatake!

88
00:05:47,575 --> 00:05:51,287
I'll take him down and become
the Hokage, no matter what!

89
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:53,644
That's the spirit!

90
00:06:16,552 --> 00:06:19,388
Kakashi is different from us, isn't he?

91
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:30,932
What a dummy!

92
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,351
He challenged Kakashi again
and got his butt kicked.

93
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,105
As if the class loser can beat
the head of the class!

94
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:38,940
Rin?!

95
00:06:47,367 --> 00:06:50,176
<i>Someday, I'll awaken my Sharingan,</i>

96
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,203
<i>and I won't lose to him...</i>

97
00:06:59,094 --> 00:07:01,805
Kakashi hasn't been coming
to class at all lately.

98
00:07:02,282 --> 00:07:05,785
I heard something unfortunate
happened to his father.

99
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:19,940
You broke the rules
for your friends' sake, right?

100
00:07:24,187 --> 00:07:25,855
I've made friends too.

101
00:07:27,455 --> 00:07:31,000
But I'll never be like you, Dad.

102
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:33,412
I'll obey the rules.

103
00:07:58,856 --> 00:08:01,401
I'll see you later, Dad.

104
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,262
I wish he'd stop messing around!

105
00:08:23,266 --> 00:08:25,435
Who wants to be together with him?!

106
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,631
Don't be so upset.

107
00:08:26,944 --> 00:08:28,863
Kakashi is already leaving the team.

108
00:08:29,892 --> 00:08:30,892
Still...

109
00:08:31,968 --> 00:08:34,054
Um, excuse me.

110
00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:40,244
By "Kakashi," are you talking
about Kakashi Hatake?

111
00:08:41,665 --> 00:08:42,666
Who are you?

112
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,983
Kakashi and I were at
the Academy together.

113
00:08:46,631 --> 00:08:48,966
Oh, so you're friends?

114
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,739
No, I wouldn't call us "friends."

115
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,324
He's pretty nasty, right?

116
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:57,246
We can't complete a mission
with a guy like that.

117
00:08:58,081 --> 00:08:59,082
Mission?

118
00:08:59,824 --> 00:09:03,161
<i>Oh, right...Kakashi is already
going on missions.</i>

119
00:09:04,723 --> 00:09:05,724
Did something happen?

120
00:09:06,456 --> 00:09:09,190
That guy always prioritizes
the mission over everything.

121
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:13,773
Even if his teammate is hurt,
or is left behind in enemy territory.

122
00:09:14,247 --> 00:09:16,916
There's no way
we can work with him.

123
00:09:17,345 --> 00:09:21,015
If you ever have to
team up with him, be careful.

124
00:09:25,074 --> 00:09:27,243
<i>Prioritizes...the mission?</i>

125
00:09:29,218 --> 00:09:31,095
<i>I'll save my friends,
no matter what.</i>

126
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,211
<i>That's my Ninja Way.</i>

127
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:37,815
<i>Him? He'd do that?</i>

128
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:48,045
Say, Rin...
Do you see Kakashi these days?

129
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,716
No, I only catch glimpses
of him in town.

130
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,216
I think he's away on missions
most of the time.

131
00:09:57,736 --> 00:09:58,737
Why?

132
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,180
I heard some rumors
about Kakashi yesterday.

133
00:10:02,621 --> 00:10:04,623
They weren't good rumors.

134
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:08,733
Last time I saw him,
he seemed to have changed a lot too.

135
00:10:10,752 --> 00:10:14,255
Could it be something to do
with his father?

136
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:16,266
Do you know something?

137
00:10:17,986 --> 00:10:18,987
Well, no...

138
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,791
Oh, I see.

139
00:10:22,934 --> 00:10:25,395
Okay, Obito. See you tomorrow!

140
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,981
Yeah.

141
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:39,709
<i>Kakashi...</i>

142
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,163
Hey, Kakashi!

143
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:50,960
How's it going?

144
00:10:54,748 --> 00:10:56,783
I've been hearing a lot about you.

145
00:10:57,093 --> 00:10:58,893
Looks like you've been
seeing a lot of action.

146
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:06,015
Hey, did something happen?

147
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,100
If something's on your mind...

148
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:10,127
I'm not so desperate that
I need you to worry about me.

149
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,671
Hey...you...

150
00:11:20,336 --> 00:11:21,671
Leave me alone.

151
00:11:27,907 --> 00:11:29,074
Kakashi...

152
00:12:01,037 --> 00:12:02,414
I found you, Obito!

153
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:04,952
Rin!

154
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,106
Are you all right?!

155
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,375
I just slipped.

156
00:12:14,725 --> 00:12:16,065
I'm okay. I'm okay.

157
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,453
You're training in this rain?

158
00:12:20,595 --> 00:12:25,031
Yeah...I figured I have to try harder
if I'm going to catch up to that guy.

159
00:12:25,665 --> 00:12:26,762
"That guy"?

160
00:12:26,873 --> 00:12:27,874
I mean, Kakashi.

161
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,095
One day, I'll surprise him.

162
00:12:30,498 --> 00:12:33,584
Otherwise, I can't become
the Hokage.

163
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:37,047
Besides, he's already going
on missions.

164
00:12:37,555 --> 00:12:41,476
I have to work harder or the gap
between us will get bigger!

165
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,305
That's the spirit!
Go for it, Obito!

166
00:12:44,877 --> 00:12:45,878
Yeah!

167
00:12:52,552 --> 00:12:53,553
Excuse me.

168
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,178
You wanted to see me?

169
00:12:58,972 --> 00:13:01,391
I want to ask you a favor.

170
00:13:02,868 --> 00:13:05,696
Kakashi Hatake is
an extremely talented shinobi.

171
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:11,223
However, he fusses too much
about sticking to the rules

172
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:14,315
and clashes with his superiors
and teammates.

173
00:13:16,155 --> 00:13:21,327
He may excel in technique,
but as a human, he has much to learn.

174
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:25,137
His father broke the rules
to protect his comrades,

175
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:27,164
and then took his own life...

176
00:13:27,189 --> 00:13:30,192
His death has cast
a shadow over Kakashi.

177
00:13:31,502 --> 00:13:35,130
And you want to place him
under my supervision...

178
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,111
<i>Oh no, oh no!</i>

179
00:13:50,286 --> 00:13:51,931
I can't believe you were late

180
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:55,185
for both your entrance and
graduation ceremonies!

181
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,749
Graduation is over!

182
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,298
But there was this old lady...

183
00:14:02,047 --> 00:14:05,555
You have an awfully high rate
of encounters with old people, don't you?

184
00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:09,543
Lately...I've been getting ambushed
by a lot of them.

185
00:14:09,885 --> 00:14:12,054
That sounds premeditated!

186
00:14:16,824 --> 00:14:18,075
Really...

187
00:14:19,511 --> 00:14:20,267
Come on...

188
00:14:20,596 --> 00:14:21,582
This way!

189
00:14:28,455 --> 00:14:31,166
Here is the graduation certificate
for Obito Uchiha!

190
00:14:31,947 --> 00:14:33,889
"This certifies that
you have graduated

191
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,352
from the Hidden Leaf Ninja Academy.

192
00:14:35,867 --> 00:14:38,477
You are commended
for persevering

193
00:14:38,553 --> 00:14:41,601
through the rain and wind
to reach this milestone!"

194
00:14:44,901 --> 00:14:47,028
Here! Congratulations!

195
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:50,390
Rin...

196
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:55,322
Thank you, Rin.

197
00:14:57,324 --> 00:14:58,701
No one's here to watch...

198
00:14:59,161 --> 00:15:02,254
But this makes me happier than
receiving it from that old-man Hokage!

199
00:15:02,644 --> 00:15:06,213
We're genin now,
so you have shape up.

200
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,698
Yeah, I know.

201
00:15:08,215 --> 00:15:12,386
We'll now be part of a 3-man squad
and go on missions, right?

202
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,122
Have the teams already
been announced?

203
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,562
Yes, they have.

204
00:15:18,141 --> 00:15:20,894
So, are you and me...

205
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,214
Well...

206
00:15:25,707 --> 00:15:26,795
Don't tell me...

207
00:15:27,655 --> 00:15:28,656
we're on different...

208
00:15:29,806 --> 00:15:31,808
Unfortunately,
we're on the same team!

209
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:32,807
No way!

210
00:15:32,872 --> 00:15:36,639
Yup. I'm stuck looking
after you again...

211
00:15:36,664 --> 00:15:39,333
Yes! Yes!

212
00:15:42,091 --> 00:15:43,735
And who's the third member?

213
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:45,794
About that...

214
00:15:49,427 --> 00:15:51,012
You're late, Obito!

215
00:15:51,421 --> 00:15:54,591
You're finally here.
You must be Obito.

216
00:15:54,784 --> 00:15:56,119
We've been waiting for you.

217
00:15:57,346 --> 00:15:58,223
Barely made it...

218
00:15:58,473 --> 00:16:00,058
You're really late.

219
00:16:00,477 --> 00:16:03,230
I'm Minato, your leader from today.
Glad to meet you.

220
00:16:03,617 --> 00:16:04,618
Yeah!

221
00:16:05,603 --> 00:16:08,606
Anyway, let's have
our first training session together.

222
00:16:08,952 --> 00:16:09,953
R-Right!

223
00:16:10,715 --> 00:16:14,052
In this session,
I want to see your teamwork.

224
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,476
Teamwork?

225
00:16:17,423 --> 00:16:19,509
And the exercise will be...this.

226
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:31,372
You all pass!

227
00:16:31,628 --> 00:16:32,629
All right...

228
00:16:32,702 --> 00:16:34,927
We'll start our first mission tomorrow.

229
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,026
That's more like it!

230
00:16:36,168 --> 00:16:38,605
I'll show what I've got
in a real battle!

231
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,782
Actually, this first mission
is inside the village.

232
00:16:42,945 --> 00:16:45,698
Like finding a lost pet
or a lost item.

233
00:16:46,966 --> 00:16:48,968
Those are just odd jobs!

234
00:16:49,498 --> 00:16:51,834
A mission is a mission.

235
00:16:52,366 --> 00:16:56,120
If you succeed, then I'll assign
more important missions.

236
00:16:57,241 --> 00:17:00,119
Kakashi, you've been on
many missions already

237
00:17:00,211 --> 00:17:02,922
and this may seem boring,

238
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:04,562
but do your best anyway.

239
00:17:06,532 --> 00:17:08,409
Okay! Kakashi, I challenge you!

240
00:17:09,694 --> 00:17:12,697
Let's see who can
complete more missions.

241
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,043
That's stupid. Do as you please.

242
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:16,778
You chicken?

243
00:17:16,816 --> 00:17:17,817
What did you say?

244
00:17:21,845 --> 00:17:22,888
It's not here.

245
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,281
It's not here.

246
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:30,916
Found it?

247
00:17:30,941 --> 00:17:31,984
No.

248
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,319
It's not here either.

249
00:17:33,516 --> 00:17:35,685
Looking for a lost pet
isn't easy, is it?

250
00:17:36,265 --> 00:17:39,244
But if we can't succeed
at something like this,

251
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:42,772
our team will never be sent
on real missions.

252
00:17:44,785 --> 00:17:46,120
By the way, where's Obito?

253
00:17:46,975 --> 00:17:49,394
He was determined to
do everything alone,

254
00:17:49,618 --> 00:17:51,120
and went off somewhere.

255
00:17:52,936 --> 00:17:55,396
<i>Is he serious about beating me?</i>

256
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:15,095
Oh, Obito...

257
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:19,036
That cat was on the rooftop
up ahead basking in the sun.

258
00:18:19,271 --> 00:18:23,400
Obito, I saw that thing
on a park bench.

259
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,039
Oh right, by the way,

260
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,398
I have some yummy sweets
you can take with you.

261
00:18:33,528 --> 00:18:35,697
Finding a lost pet, and a lost item!

262
00:18:35,871 --> 00:18:38,624
Solved them both,
thanks to the grannies.

263
00:18:39,248 --> 00:18:40,374
And I even got treats!

264
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:43,248
You're so popular
with the old ladies, Obito.

265
00:18:43,951 --> 00:18:46,811
You really weren't lying
all those times were you late.

266
00:18:47,657 --> 00:18:50,076
"One good deed deserves another."

267
00:18:50,567 --> 00:18:54,113
This time, Obito's kindness
was returned.

268
00:18:54,783 --> 00:18:56,118
How's that, Kakashi?!

269
00:19:05,695 --> 00:19:10,408
All the odd jobs in the village
were taken care of in one day.

270
00:19:11,145 --> 00:19:14,399
Right? It's because I'm the man
who will become the Hokage!

271
00:19:14,565 --> 00:19:16,401
This is nothing!

272
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:22,589
Lord Hokage, I believe this team
is far more skilled than we thought.

273
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:29,130
You're right. Kakashi already
has lots of field experience.

274
00:19:29,357 --> 00:19:32,986
Perhaps I shall send them along
with you on your mission tomorrow.

275
00:19:33,822 --> 00:19:35,199
On Minato Sensei's mission?!

276
00:19:35,538 --> 00:19:37,623
Is this a real mission?!

277
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:41,305
Yes. And the client specifically
requested Minato.

278
00:19:41,826 --> 00:19:44,161
It's a C-rank mission.

279
00:19:44,378 --> 00:19:45,701
Although the risk is low,

280
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,978
I'd be lying if I said
there's absolutely none.

281
00:19:48,334 --> 00:19:52,213
I was planning to assign you
to more odd jobs in the village

282
00:19:52,238 --> 00:19:54,824
while Minato was away.

283
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,155
But there are no more requests.

284
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:02,326
And, I can't let you just
wait around.

285
00:20:02,597 --> 00:20:03,598
Yes!

286
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:07,094
This means we're going
on our first real mission.

287
00:20:07,634 --> 00:20:08,927
Okay then...

288
00:20:09,852 --> 00:20:11,393
I'm counting on you all from tomorrow.

289
00:20:11,592 --> 00:20:12,593
– Yes, sir!
– Yes, sir!

290
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,124
Well, Kakashi?!

291
00:20:17,475 --> 00:20:19,435
You should be grateful to me.

292
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:23,347
I'm the only reason why
there are no more odd jobs to do.

293
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:28,018
Kakashi, don't get upset with Obito.

294
00:20:29,548 --> 00:20:32,718
Obito's been worried about you
for a long time.

295
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,234
He thinks you've changed...

296
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,612
W-What're you saying, Rin?!

297
00:20:38,676 --> 00:20:40,469
Well, it's true.

298
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,195
And you always said that
Kakashi was better than you...

299
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,057
So you trained hard to catch up!

300
00:20:49,358 --> 00:20:51,037
Did not! I never said that!

301
00:20:51,062 --> 00:20:52,314
You're imagining things!

302
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,381
Come on, let's all shake hands.

303
00:20:57,726 --> 00:20:59,728
We're on the same team now.

304
00:21:00,001 --> 00:21:02,169
I'm not shaking hands with this guy!

305
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,221
Really...

306
00:21:04,314 --> 00:21:05,982
You're both hopeless!

307
00:21:09,954 --> 00:21:10,955
Then...

308
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,627
I'll connect the both of you.

309
00:21:17,654 --> 00:21:20,235
Okay guys, for this mission,

310
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,262
we will be escorting shinobi
from another village.

311
00:21:22,675 --> 00:21:24,677
One of them is carrying
a secret missive.

312
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,668
Namely, that's what we are guarding.

313
00:21:28,261 --> 00:21:30,930
There will also be three other escorts
from the requesting village.

314
00:21:31,684 --> 00:21:33,686
If fighting breaks out...

315
00:21:33,974 --> 00:21:37,102
First and foremost, I want you three
to make sure you're safe.

316
00:21:37,481 --> 00:21:38,482
Understood?

317
00:21:39,807 --> 00:21:40,777
All right!

318
00:21:40,802 --> 00:21:44,723
I'm gonna show my stuff big-time
and make it to Hokage!

319
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:47,549
It's not going to be that easy.

320
00:21:47,815 --> 00:21:52,070
Obito, were you even listening
to Minato Sensei?

321
00:21:52,339 --> 00:21:54,019
We are not to engage in
any kind of battle.

322
00:21:54,433 --> 00:21:58,520
Besides, we'd only get
in Minato Sensei's way.

323
00:21:58,868 --> 00:22:01,037
Is he really that amazing?

324
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,679
Haven't you ever heard of
the Yellow Flash of the Leaf?

325
00:22:04,078 --> 00:22:06,122
I have.

326
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:09,504
He's an incredible shinobi whose fame
has spread to other villages too.

327
00:22:10,588 --> 00:22:12,146
And he's our teacher,
Minato Namikaze,

328
00:22:12,171 --> 00:22:14,173
the man touted to become
the next Hokage.

329
00:22:14,987 --> 00:22:18,282
Seriously?! Someone that great
is teaching us?

330
00:22:18,684 --> 00:22:20,811
I feel my blood rushing!

331
00:22:20,836 --> 00:22:23,482
Man, I wish someone
would attack us.

332
00:22:23,743 --> 00:22:24,744
Jeez...

333
00:22:25,941 --> 00:22:28,590
Hey, I wonder who's stronger,

334
00:22:28,736 --> 00:22:32,563
the Yellow Flash of the Leaf
or the White Fang of the Leaf?

335
00:22:33,444 --> 00:22:34,737
O-Obito!

336
00:22:35,738 --> 00:22:39,867
The Hidden Leaf had a hero
named the White Fang.

337
00:22:40,249 --> 00:22:42,794
But I heard he died
protecting the village.

338
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:44,923
Haven't you heard of him?

339
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:45,949
No, I haven't.

340
00:22:46,697 --> 00:22:47,698
Kakashi?

341
00:22:48,646 --> 00:22:50,231
What's with him?

342
00:22:56,611 --> 00:22:58,613
<i>This is strange.</i>

343
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,048
<i>We're surrounded...</i>

344
00:23:02,306 --> 00:23:03,891
<i>There are quite a few of them.</i>

345
00:23:04,434 --> 00:23:05,643
<i>What's going on?</i>

346
00:23:06,227 --> 00:23:09,105
<i>This is far more dangerous than
the rank assigned to this mission.</i>

347
00:23:09,836 --> 00:23:12,672
<i>I have to stop them here
before I'm completely surrounded.</i>

348
00:23:14,263 --> 00:23:16,765
<i>Bringing along the team
might have been a mistake.</i>

349
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,556
<i>Who can I depend on?</i>

350
00:23:20,864 --> 00:23:22,574
<i>He can guard one person.</i>

351
00:23:22,918 --> 00:23:25,588
<i>I'll have to guard the other one.</i>

352
00:23:28,294 --> 00:23:29,378
Everyone, listen up.

353
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:31,453
What is it, Sensei?

354
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,406
Looks like the enemy is on our tail.

355
00:23:35,405 --> 00:23:36,698
Seriously?! We're gonna fight?!

356
00:23:37,002 --> 00:23:39,004
Obito! This is not a game!

357
00:23:39,228 --> 00:23:40,229
Uh, yes sir...

358
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,256
There are quite a few of them.

359
00:23:43,835 --> 00:23:47,047
Obito and I will track back
to confront them.

360
00:23:47,528 --> 00:23:50,698
In the meantime, Kakashi
and Rin will complete the mission.

361
00:23:51,423 --> 00:23:53,758
It's imperative that you two escape.

362
00:23:54,044 --> 00:23:55,045
– Yes, sir!
– Yes, sir!

363
00:23:55,527 --> 00:23:56,986
All right...Let's go, Obito!

364
00:23:57,195 --> 00:23:58,195
Roger!

365
00:24:01,905 --> 00:24:03,615
Oh man, Minato Sensei!

366
00:24:03,784 --> 00:24:06,621
To have you pick me
instead of Kakashi...

367
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,479
This just means you depend on me!

368
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:14,172
Obito, we're going to lure
the enemy without a fight

369
00:24:14,197 --> 00:24:15,865
and separate them
from the main group.

370
00:24:15,963 --> 00:24:16,964
I know that!

371
00:24:20,718 --> 00:24:23,137
<i>Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!</i>

372
00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:29,727
Oh, not bad.

373
00:24:30,144 --> 00:24:32,563
I wasn't kidding about
practicing every day!

374
00:24:32,841 --> 00:24:34,771
I'll take down
every single one of them!

375
00:24:34,893 --> 00:24:36,979
Don't get carried away!
I said no fighting!

376
00:24:39,573 --> 00:24:40,316
Obito!

377
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,902
You're in the way!

378
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,559
<i>He's strong!</i>

379
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:54,852
You're just a kid!

380
00:24:54,877 --> 00:24:57,171
You can't beat me with that!

381
00:24:57,248 --> 00:24:58,291
<i>Damn it!</i>

382
00:24:58,506 --> 00:25:01,008
<i>I'm not going to lose here!</i>

383
00:25:01,926 --> 00:25:02,927
I'm...

384
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,765
...gonna become the Hokage!

385
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:10,885
<i>I did it!</i>

386
00:25:14,962 --> 00:25:16,130
A shadow clone?!

387
00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:22,656
You're mine!

388
00:25:23,033 --> 00:25:24,034
<i>Not good!</i>

389
00:25:34,267 --> 00:25:35,268
Are you all right?

390
00:25:35,974 --> 00:25:36,975
Minato Sensei!

391
00:25:47,531 --> 00:25:49,116
<i>This is not good...</i>

392
00:25:54,613 --> 00:25:55,656
They're here.

393
00:25:56,036 --> 00:25:57,580
Rin! Go on ahead!

394
00:25:57,605 --> 00:25:58,606
Got it.

395
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:07,984
Damn—!

396
00:26:14,182 --> 00:26:15,975
Kakashi! We have to save him!

397
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,085
Minato Sensei is still
nearby right now!

398
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,510
If we turn back and let him know...

399
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:22,649
No! A shinobi's duty is to
carry out his mission!

400
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:23,848
Kakashi...

401
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,402
Run! Getting away is imperative!

402
00:26:26,478 --> 00:26:28,480
Once we're in the forest,
the village will be near!

403
00:26:28,596 --> 00:26:30,598
They won't pursue us that far!

404
00:26:31,349 --> 00:26:32,350
Understood!

405
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,275
We've come this far.
We should be safe.

406
00:26:42,221 --> 00:26:43,222
What about Obito?

407
00:26:43,444 --> 00:26:45,655
Sensei is with him.
I'm sure they're fine.

408
00:26:46,489 --> 00:26:47,615
Thank you.

409
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:50,014
I must hand it to
the Yellow Flash's team.

410
00:26:50,855 --> 00:26:53,608
Thanks to you, the secret missive
will be delivered safely.

411
00:26:54,664 --> 00:26:55,665
Don't mention it.

412
00:26:56,208 --> 00:26:58,668
Unfortunately, one man had
to be sacrificed.

413
00:26:59,323 --> 00:27:01,325
That could not be helped.

414
00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:04,424
However...he won't be...

415
00:27:04,449 --> 00:27:06,367
the only sacrifice!

416
00:27:08,382 --> 00:27:09,383
What the—?!

417
00:27:11,889 --> 00:27:12,973
What's going on?

418
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:19,584
S-So you're...the traitors!

419
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:25,451
Since you were just so focused
on completing the mission,

420
00:27:25,476 --> 00:27:27,562
you made our mission easy.

421
00:27:27,769 --> 00:27:31,439
Even someone like the Yellow Flash
can't span this distance quickly.

422
00:27:31,992 --> 00:27:35,329
Sorry, but you're going
to have to die too.

423
00:27:36,158 --> 00:27:37,326
No way...

424
00:27:40,456 --> 00:27:41,352
Rin, get out of here!

425
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,051
But...!

426
00:27:42,076 --> 00:27:43,326
You're going to get in my way!

427
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,781
<i>Earth Style:</i>

428
00:27:48,365 --> 00:27:49,366
<i>Mud Wall!</i>

429
00:27:54,682 --> 00:27:56,183
Damn, they got away!

430
00:28:00,104 --> 00:28:00,665
Wha—?!

431
00:28:00,689 --> 00:28:02,022
From inside the Earth Style?!

432
00:28:08,863 --> 00:28:09,864
Rin!

433
00:28:11,031 --> 00:28:12,366
I'll start treatment immediately!

434
00:28:14,034 --> 00:28:15,202
What happened, Kakashi?!

435
00:28:15,536 --> 00:28:16,536
Minato Sensei!

436
00:28:17,297 --> 00:28:18,298
Obito...

437
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:20,210
Kakashi? Rin?

438
00:28:20,634 --> 00:28:22,177
What am I doing here?

439
00:28:22,376 --> 00:28:23,377
I'll explain later.

440
00:28:23,944 --> 00:28:24,945
First, Kakashi...

441
00:28:25,588 --> 00:28:26,881
What happened here?

442
00:28:27,923 --> 00:28:30,345
We escorted them safely to this point,

443
00:28:31,277 --> 00:28:32,637
but the other two were traitors...

444
00:28:33,257 --> 00:28:34,258
Two of them?

445
00:28:34,555 --> 00:28:37,933
Please, I'm not going to make it.

446
00:28:42,209 --> 00:28:45,296
The contents of the secret missive...

447
00:28:47,778 --> 00:28:50,864
But we can't look at its contents...

448
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:52,999
Don't worry about it.

449
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,216
Please, just confirm that
it's the real one.

450
00:29:06,046 --> 00:29:07,631
What does this mean?

451
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,149
My superior told me that

452
00:29:10,295 --> 00:29:15,467
another teammate and I would
both be handed secret missives.

453
00:29:17,293 --> 00:29:20,254
And only one of them would
be the real one.

454
00:29:20,533 --> 00:29:21,534
Why?!

455
00:29:21,848 --> 00:29:26,853
There was intel that there could be
a traitor among us.

456
00:29:27,444 --> 00:29:29,195
So who has the real missive?

457
00:29:29,566 --> 00:29:33,111
If the traitor had it,
he wouldn't have attacked me.

458
00:29:33,864 --> 00:29:34,865
So...

459
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:42,014
It was him.

460
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,992
Kakashi, where's the other guy?

461
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:46,048
Well, on our way here...

462
00:29:47,169 --> 00:29:50,506
Please, you must get
the secret missive!

463
00:29:57,598 --> 00:29:58,599
There's nothing I can do.

464
00:30:02,038 --> 00:30:03,850
Damn it, did they hear us?

465
00:30:04,204 --> 00:30:05,205
Kakashi.

466
00:30:06,015 --> 00:30:08,184
You didn't leave someone
to die, did you?

467
00:30:08,931 --> 00:30:11,099
I only prioritized the mission.

468
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:13,731
I followed the rules.

469
00:30:14,204 --> 00:30:15,277
The rules?

470
00:30:16,323 --> 00:30:18,200
Those who don't follow
the rules are scum.

471
00:30:18,885 --> 00:30:20,678
But look at the result!

472
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:23,191
If you hadn't turned your back
on your comrade,

473
00:30:23,216 --> 00:30:24,474
this wouldn't have happened!

474
00:30:24,499 --> 00:30:25,667
Stop, Obito!

475
00:30:27,056 --> 00:30:28,975
This was an unexpected incident.

476
00:30:30,105 --> 00:30:31,148
Kakashi is not to blame.

477
00:30:31,771 --> 00:30:32,772
Damn it!

478
00:30:33,699 --> 00:30:34,769
I'm going!

479
00:30:34,855 --> 00:30:35,940
Go where?

480
00:30:35,965 --> 00:30:36,818
Isn't it obvious?!

481
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:38,625
I'm going to save that guy!

482
00:30:38,846 --> 00:30:40,991
But he's right in
the unexpected incident.

483
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:43,162
He's right. It's too dangerous.

484
00:30:43,726 --> 00:30:46,520
I'm not about to fail
my first mission!

485
00:30:47,106 --> 00:30:48,232
We didn't fail.

486
00:30:48,439 --> 00:30:49,940
This was an unforeseen occurrence!

487
00:30:51,207 --> 00:30:55,170
Kakashi, for an honor student,
you're pretty dumb.

488
00:30:55,212 --> 00:30:56,051
What did you say?

489
00:30:56,281 --> 00:30:57,574
Think about it.

490
00:30:57,863 --> 00:31:00,699
The four guys we were supposed
to guard have all disappeared.

491
00:31:01,201 --> 00:31:05,080
Who's gonna support our claim
that this was all unexpected?

492
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:09,519
If the village who requested
this mission

493
00:31:09,543 --> 00:31:12,087
pretends to not have known
about the traitors...

494
00:31:12,296 --> 00:31:14,423
Minato Sensei will be forced
to take responsibility!

495
00:31:15,075 --> 00:31:16,660
Never mind me.

496
00:31:17,468 --> 00:31:19,720
Our mission is over, Obito.

497
00:31:20,141 --> 00:31:21,726
All I want to say is...

498
00:31:21,751 --> 00:31:24,504
Sensei, you can keep dragging me
back to the village,

499
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,728
but I won't give up searching
for the guy.

500
00:31:28,738 --> 00:31:30,239
I never turn my back
on a comrade!

501
00:31:32,066 --> 00:31:33,067
– Obito!
– Obito!

502
00:31:33,593 --> 00:31:34,594
Damn it.

503
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:38,662
I guess it's useless to try
and stop you.

504
00:31:39,394 --> 00:31:41,383
Then I'll go back to where he fell.

505
00:31:41,408 --> 00:31:43,053
Kakashi, you check downstream.

506
00:31:43,077 --> 00:31:44,453
And Obito, check beyond that.

507
00:31:45,573 --> 00:31:47,074
Rin, you go with Kakashi.

508
00:31:47,431 --> 00:31:47,974
Right!

509
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:52,039
Listen up. Report to me
the minute you find him.

510
00:32:14,441 --> 00:32:15,442
He's here!

511
00:32:19,823 --> 00:32:21,033
We found him.

512
00:32:24,648 --> 00:32:27,275
<i>Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!</i>

513
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,962
<i>There are too many enemies.</i>

514
00:32:37,542 --> 00:32:38,877
Rin! Take care of him!

515
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:40,442
Got it!

516
00:32:40,467 --> 00:32:41,468
Let's get away from here.

517
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:43,112
Wait!

518
00:32:43,345 --> 00:32:44,846
The scroll!

519
00:32:51,194 --> 00:32:52,237
Withdraw!

520
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:56,792
Obito! Rin!
Guard him!

521
00:32:56,912 --> 00:32:58,247
What about you, Kakashi?!

522
00:32:58,683 --> 00:33:00,226
I'm getting the scroll back!

523
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,156
That's reckless!
You saw how many there were!

524
00:33:02,441 --> 00:33:03,799
I won't let you complain!

525
00:33:03,824 --> 00:33:08,746
If saving him is your Ninja Way,
completing the mission is mine.

526
00:33:09,429 --> 00:33:10,253
Kakashi!

527
00:33:10,278 --> 00:33:12,364
Obito, we have to contact
Minato Sensei!

528
00:33:12,709 --> 00:33:13,710
Yeah!

529
00:33:18,165 --> 00:33:19,166
Obito!

530
00:33:24,815 --> 00:33:28,110
You bastard, do think you can
take us all on by yourself?

531
00:33:28,932 --> 00:33:30,392
I will complete my mission.

532
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:33,730
Kill him.

533
00:33:34,073 --> 00:33:35,616
Obito! Did you find him?

534
00:33:36,326 --> 00:33:39,121
Kakashi went after the enemy
to get the scroll back!

535
00:33:39,569 --> 00:33:40,570
Kakashi did what?

536
00:33:42,196 --> 00:33:43,197
I hope I make it in time!

537
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:54,792
Come on!

538
00:33:59,213 --> 00:34:01,548
Don't let him...get away!

539
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:12,378
<i>Rasen-Flash Super-Circle
Dance Howl Stage Three!</i>

540
00:34:19,293 --> 00:34:20,502
Minato Sensei.

541
00:34:25,123 --> 00:34:29,002
So, were you able to uphold
the principles you believe in?

542
00:34:32,955 --> 00:34:35,165
This completes the mission.

543
00:34:38,671 --> 00:34:39,672
Yes...

544
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:43,323
Thank you for saving my life.

545
00:34:46,614 --> 00:34:49,283
The Yellow Flash of the Leaf...
I hope we meet again someday.

546
00:34:49,972 --> 00:34:52,266
All right then, let's go everyone.

547
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,816
Sensei, missions are
really difficult, aren't they?

548
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:02,477
You're right.

549
00:35:02,502 --> 00:35:05,087
Things don't always go
the way you envision them.

550
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:08,398
But I'm glad the secret missive
was delivered safely.

551
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,531
Yes...

552
00:35:10,994 --> 00:35:13,163
So we successfully
completed the mission.

553
00:35:13,898 --> 00:35:14,899
Probably.

554
00:35:15,269 --> 00:35:17,646
"Probably"? What do you mean?

555
00:35:18,818 --> 00:35:20,028
Back there, he said...

556
00:35:20,684 --> 00:35:23,812
<i>Thank you for saving my life.</i>

557
00:35:24,018 --> 00:35:25,816
If the mission was successful,

558
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,610
he would be more concerned
about the secret missive

559
00:35:27,634 --> 00:35:28,719
and not his life.

560
00:35:29,283 --> 00:35:31,327
What do you mean?!

561
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:34,085
The missive he had
was also a fake.

562
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:38,120
We were probably decoys.

563
00:35:38,544 --> 00:35:40,546
Another team delivered
the real missive.

564
00:35:41,749 --> 00:35:44,126
That's the real reason
they requested Minato Sensei

565
00:35:44,151 --> 00:35:45,617
for a C-rank mission.

566
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,173
With Minato Sensei as the escort,

567
00:35:49,276 --> 00:35:51,945
it would seem that we were
really guarding the real thing.

568
00:35:52,653 --> 00:35:55,239
When did you figure that out?

569
00:35:55,554 --> 00:35:57,306
I thought it was a possibility

570
00:35:57,723 --> 00:35:59,808
when we discovered
the first missive was a fake.

571
00:35:59,941 --> 00:36:02,312
And you risked your life
to go after a missive

572
00:36:02,336 --> 00:36:04,004
that could have been a fake?

573
00:36:04,402 --> 00:36:05,731
That was the mission.

574
00:36:05,981 --> 00:36:08,066
That's my Ninja Way.

575
00:36:22,165 --> 00:36:24,132
Good, you actually hit me.

576
00:36:26,144 --> 00:36:28,544
Hitting sensei, that's amazing Kakashi!

577
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,213
It was just one hit.

578
00:36:30,557 --> 00:36:32,307
It isn't all that praiseworthy.

579
00:36:36,705 --> 00:36:38,646
I can do it too, you know!

580
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:42,475
Nice timing, right?

581
00:36:46,021 --> 00:36:47,255
Kushina!

582
00:36:48,325 --> 00:36:49,533
Yay!

583
00:36:50,059 --> 00:36:51,409
You all doing your best?

584
00:36:51,604 --> 00:36:54,321
They're doing great. We
were just about to take a break.

585
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:55,213
Great!

586
00:36:55,356 --> 00:36:56,531
Here, lunch.

587
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,651
Here's your order!
It's the Kushina Special.

588
00:37:00,269 --> 00:37:01,319
Alright!

589
00:37:01,403 --> 00:37:03,794
I love the food
you make, Kushina! Thanks!

590
00:37:11,097 --> 00:37:12,780
You're just so cute!

591
00:37:12,805 --> 00:37:14,847
You're such a good girl, Rin, you know?

592
00:37:18,565 --> 00:37:21,940
I took the time to bring lunch all
the way out here to you guys,

593
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:24,056
and that's the kind
of thanks I get from you?

594
00:37:25,446 --> 00:37:27,338
Hey, I didn't ask you to do that!

595
00:37:27,397 --> 00:37:28,622
I'm not even hungry!

596
00:37:34,557 --> 00:37:37,973
Trying to be tough is okay,
but go ahead and eat something first.

597
00:37:38,191 --> 00:37:40,783
I mean, you can't fight
on an empty stomach, can you?

598
00:37:41,035 --> 00:37:42,385
I-I don't want it!

599
00:37:42,798 --> 00:37:46,239
I won't take anyone's handouts!
I can fight without food!

600
00:37:48,252 --> 00:37:50,293
Hey...you're pretty manly!

601
00:37:50,897 --> 00:37:53,913
Yeah right...like I'd ever
say something like that to you!

602
00:37:57,153 --> 00:38:00,462
Now no more out of you! Eat!
Being healthy is part of being a ninja!

603
00:38:00,614 --> 00:38:03,072
What you just said proves
that you're nothing but a kid!

604
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,457
Well...you know what!

605
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:06,018
There they go again...

606
00:38:06,387 --> 00:38:08,070
Let's just eat, okay you two?

607
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:11,629
Just who do you think
you're calling violent?

608
00:38:15,129 --> 00:38:18,154
You know, Kakashi really
is getting a lot better.

609
00:38:18,349 --> 00:38:21,682
Yeah, for his age
he's really something else.

610
00:38:21,979 --> 00:38:25,646
Rin is growing well too.
They're becoming a good team.

611
00:38:28,116 --> 00:38:29,532
And Obito?

612
00:38:32,596 --> 00:38:35,271
He's hardly more than a
bragging little half-pint.

613
00:38:35,841 --> 00:38:37,549
He's always tripping
over himself,

614
00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:39,191
he can't throw shuriken straight,

615
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:41,035
and his jutsu setup is just...

616
00:38:41,369 --> 00:38:42,628
He'll need some work...

617
00:38:46,426 --> 00:38:47,809
Well, it's like you said...

618
00:38:48,053 --> 00:38:50,845
Obito does have a lot
of things he needs to work on.

619
00:38:52,114 --> 00:38:52,955
But still,

620
00:38:53,351 --> 00:38:56,234
his bright and outgoing
attitude is really important.

621
00:38:57,432 --> 00:39:01,382
Obito being there deepens the
bond between everyone on the team.

622
00:39:01,748 --> 00:39:03,157
That's just a fact.

623
00:39:06,013 --> 00:39:08,571
Well, I don't need
to tell you that.

624
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:11,191
I mean, he is
your favorite isn't he?

625
00:39:12,836 --> 00:39:14,902
Oh? You sure about that?

626
00:39:17,724 --> 00:39:18,715
Here you go.

627
00:39:20,935 --> 00:39:21,826
Thanks.

628
00:39:25,724 --> 00:39:26,782
By the way,

629
00:39:27,351 --> 00:39:29,976
is the location of your next
mission going to be decided soon?

630
00:39:30,732 --> 00:39:34,440
Yeah. I'll find out for sure
within the next few days, but...

631
00:39:34,775 --> 00:39:37,233
I think it's going
to be at Kannabi Bridge.

632
00:39:39,054 --> 00:39:40,220
Kannabi Bridge...

633
00:39:42,025 --> 00:39:45,233
I hope the war ends soon...

634
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:52,900
<i>This is bad!</i>

635
00:39:57,106 --> 00:39:58,858
<i>At this rate, I'll be killed!</i>

636
00:39:59,692 --> 00:40:00,776
<i>Can I make it?!</i>

637
00:40:09,922 --> 00:40:10,923
Did I make it?

638
00:40:11,266 --> 00:40:13,268
No, Obito, you're late!

639
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:17,320
What time did you think
we were supposed to meet?!

640
00:40:18,032 --> 00:40:19,575
If you're a full-fledged ninja

641
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,728
you're expected to follow the rules!

642
00:40:23,322 --> 00:40:25,133
Well...I was on the way,

643
00:40:25,157 --> 00:40:27,993
but an old lady carrying a load
asked me for directions...

644
00:40:28,348 --> 00:40:29,617
And I got something in my eye...

645
00:40:29,642 --> 00:40:31,394
Okay! That's a lie, isn't it?!

646
00:40:32,808 --> 00:40:34,143
That's enough, Kakashi.

647
00:40:34,917 --> 00:40:37,670
Obito showed the old lady the way...

648
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,027
Isn't that right?

649
00:40:39,128 --> 00:40:40,796
I carried her bag too!

650
00:40:41,288 --> 00:40:42,789
You're too lenient, Sensei.

651
00:40:43,457 --> 00:40:46,085
Besides, there's no way that
some needy person appears

652
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,430
before Obito each and every time!

653
00:40:48,682 --> 00:40:52,686
Those who break the rules and
regulations are regarded as scum!

654
00:40:53,045 --> 00:40:54,046
Isn't that so?!

655
00:40:56,023 --> 00:40:58,943
Don't you have a shred of kindness
in your heart?!

656
00:40:59,237 --> 00:41:02,156
All you ever talk about are
rules and regulations!

657
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,282
The main thing is
your own self-control.

658
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:10,623
Now stop it, both of you.
We're all on the same team.

659
00:41:10,706 --> 00:41:12,666
You're too easy on Obito, Rin.

660
00:41:13,248 --> 00:41:15,667
This is an important day for me too.

661
00:41:16,189 --> 00:41:18,024
Y-You're right...

662
00:41:19,137 --> 00:41:20,221
What was it again?

663
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:25,251
As of today, Kakashi is a jonin like me.

664
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,045
And in order to increase
our efficiency,

665
00:41:28,183 --> 00:41:30,852
we'll be splitting into two teams.

666
00:41:31,478 --> 00:41:34,369
After all, the Leaf Village is
is currently low on military strength.

667
00:41:34,815 --> 00:41:36,984
Splitting up? Then...

668
00:41:37,068 --> 00:41:38,319
Yes, that's right.

669
00:41:38,894 --> 00:41:42,147
Kakashi will be captain of
a three-man squad with Obito and Rin.

670
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:43,908
And I'll be working alone.

671
00:41:44,698 --> 00:41:47,451
Remember, we talked about
this the other day, Obito...

672
00:41:47,578 --> 00:41:49,580
About getting Kakashi a gift.

673
00:41:52,584 --> 00:41:54,378
Sorry...I wasn't listening.

674
00:41:56,512 --> 00:41:59,723
This is my gift.
A custom-made kunai knife.

675
00:42:00,149 --> 00:42:01,960
It's sort of heavy and odd-shaped,

676
00:42:01,985 --> 00:42:04,072
but once you get accustomed to it,
it's easy to use.

677
00:42:05,014 --> 00:42:06,015
Thank you.

678
00:42:06,224 --> 00:42:07,517
And this is from me.

679
00:42:07,907 --> 00:42:10,827
Here! A personalized special medkit...

680
00:42:10,998 --> 00:42:13,834
I adjusted things a little,
to make it easier to use.

681
00:42:13,995 --> 00:42:14,996
Thanks.

682
00:42:18,232 --> 00:42:20,234
Wh-What's with that hand?

683
00:42:21,498 --> 00:42:24,209
I don't have anything to give you!

684
00:42:24,382 --> 00:42:25,841
Well...I don't mind.

685
00:42:25,953 --> 00:42:27,873
It wouldn't have been anything
worthwhile anyway.

686
00:42:28,161 --> 00:42:30,706
Getting something useless
would only get in the way.

687
00:42:31,473 --> 00:42:35,227
I still can't figure out
why you became a jonin!

688
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:37,004
You should talk.

689
00:42:38,954 --> 00:42:42,208
I'm Obito Uchiha of the Uchiha clan!

690
00:42:42,366 --> 00:42:47,955
I'll surpass you some day!
The minute my Sharingan awakens!

691
00:42:48,478 --> 00:42:51,397
Everyone in the Uchiha clan
is elite, right?

692
00:42:51,745 --> 00:42:55,165
So you shouldn't have to rely
on something like that.

693
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:56,240
What...?!

694
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:58,869
Stop it, you two!

695
00:42:59,826 --> 00:43:02,162
Can I start to explain the mission
to you?

696
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:04,543
We're close to the border.

697
00:43:10,057 --> 00:43:11,893
Got it? It's this line.

698
00:43:12,347 --> 00:43:14,981
It shows where the Land of Earth
is currently invading

699
00:43:15,006 --> 00:43:16,841
the Hidden Grass Village.

700
00:43:17,221 --> 00:43:19,515
Our enemies are
the Hidden Stone ninja...

701
00:43:20,358 --> 00:43:24,071
We have received word that
1000 ninja already make up the front line.

702
00:43:25,004 --> 00:43:27,257
They've advanced considerably
since the last time.

703
00:43:27,619 --> 00:43:30,467
The Land of Fire shares borders
with the Hidden Grass.

704
00:43:30,516 --> 00:43:32,435
We should have stepped
in long ago.

705
00:43:33,859 --> 00:43:36,446
Judging by the size of this advance...

706
00:43:36,842 --> 00:43:40,178
they must have an efficient system
for reinforcement.

707
00:43:40,762 --> 00:43:44,099
Hence, our mission is here...
at Kannabi Bridge.

708
00:43:45,429 --> 00:43:47,431
To crush one's enemy at
the battlefront requires

709
00:43:47,456 --> 00:43:49,333
an immense number of ninja.

710
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,917
So ninja like us,
who focus on sabotage missions,

711
00:43:52,942 --> 00:43:55,111
are forced to work in small, select teams.

712
00:43:56,621 --> 00:43:57,873
The bridge...you say?

713
00:43:59,417 --> 00:44:01,294
Then it's an infiltration mission?

714
00:44:03,089 --> 00:44:05,175
Right! Team Kakashi...

715
00:44:05,234 --> 00:44:08,362
Your mission is to infiltrate
the enemy's rear territory.

716
00:44:08,902 --> 00:44:13,740
You will destroy this bridge, which is used
to transport supplies and reinforcements.

717
00:44:14,011 --> 00:44:16,390
And when this is done,
withdraw immediately.

718
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:17,811
- Yes sir!
- Yes sir!

719
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:21,724
And you, Sensei?

720
00:44:22,245 --> 00:44:24,706
I will face the enemy directly
on the battlefront.

721
00:44:25,463 --> 00:44:27,549
I'll create a diversion for you.

722
00:44:28,289 --> 00:44:30,584
In any case,
Kakashi is your captain today.

723
00:44:31,124 --> 00:44:33,349
We'll travel together to the border,

724
00:44:33,374 --> 00:44:35,876
but after that your mission commences!

725
00:44:37,449 --> 00:44:38,450
- Yes sir!
- Yes sir!

726
00:44:51,026 --> 00:44:52,694
<i>Nice...Kakashi.</i>

727
00:44:53,695 --> 00:44:56,197
<i>They noticed...
They're pretty good.</i>

728
00:44:58,951 --> 00:44:59,952
<i>He's...</i>

729
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:03,013
<i>No, that can't be...</i>

730
00:45:03,456 --> 00:45:05,041
<i>I'll just watch the situation.</i>

731
00:45:07,209 --> 00:45:08,210
<i>One...</i>

732
00:45:08,973 --> 00:45:12,853
No! Be on guard, everyone.
There are twenty of them.

733
00:45:13,682 --> 00:45:15,892
Although it's probably
a shadow clone.

734
00:45:16,428 --> 00:45:19,931
I think you're right. Sensei...
I'll attack.

735
00:45:20,706 --> 00:45:21,707
Can you cover me?

736
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,739
Don't be hasty, Kakashi.
I think you should back me up.

737
00:45:28,332 --> 00:45:30,668
Sensei...I'm the captain today!

738
00:45:31,486 --> 00:45:34,238
I want to test a new jutsu
I've been working on.

739
00:45:35,156 --> 00:45:36,157
<i>He's coming...</i>

740
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:37,541
<i>Chidori!</i>

741
00:45:38,794 --> 00:45:40,087
<i>What is that jutsu?!</i>

742
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:41,864
<i>Wh-What an incredible chakra...</i>

743
00:45:43,499 --> 00:45:44,500
<i>Here I go!</i>

744
00:45:47,268 --> 00:45:48,604
No matter what their numbers are,

745
00:45:48,629 --> 00:45:50,590
with this jutsu,
I can take them down in a flash.

746
00:45:50,941 --> 00:45:52,693
It's just like your nickname.

747
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:54,836
Besides...

748
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:57,224
Sensei...You said it yourself.

749
00:45:57,618 --> 00:45:59,036
Right now, I'm the captain.

750
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:03,020
The rule says that the team must obey
its captain's orders, Sensei!

751
00:46:09,653 --> 00:46:11,572
To think he'd attack head on...

752
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:24,351
Your kunai attacks helped me
pinpoint your location.

753
00:46:24,809 --> 00:46:25,810
Here I go!

754
00:46:28,989 --> 00:46:29,991
<i>He's fast!</i>

755
00:46:33,931 --> 00:46:35,307
<i>Damn! It's a shadow clone...!</i>

756
00:46:36,039 --> 00:46:37,332
<i>Then on to the next!</i>

757
00:46:44,858 --> 00:46:46,067
Don't let your guard down!

758
00:46:46,684 --> 00:46:47,685
Yes sir!

759
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:53,056
That's number 18!

760
00:46:54,533 --> 00:46:56,160
Don't get cocky, brat!

761
00:47:08,049 --> 00:47:09,050
Kakashi!

762
00:47:10,176 --> 00:47:13,596
<i>I was barely able to counter
that brat.</i>

763
00:47:13,653 --> 00:47:15,697
<i>But that yellow-haired guy's moves are...</i>

764
00:47:16,287 --> 00:47:17,539
<i>I marked him...</i>

765
00:47:37,789 --> 00:47:40,792
<i>Sensei's Transportation Technique is
so fast!</i>

766
00:47:41,375 --> 00:47:45,588
N-No way...are you the
"Yellow Flash of the Leaf"?!

767
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:49,210
Those of us from the Land of Earth...

768
00:47:49,885 --> 00:47:53,764
have been taught by our commanders
to run when we see you.

769
00:47:53,942 --> 00:47:55,860
I finally understand what they meant.

770
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:04,582
Kakashi's wound is serious...

771
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,843
We'll retreat and regroup.

772
00:48:08,244 --> 00:48:09,370
I'm all right!

773
00:48:09,454 --> 00:48:10,872
No, you're not!

774
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:14,780
All because you ignored Sensei's warnings
and charged ahead!

775
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:17,352
I don't need to listen to that.

776
00:48:17,666 --> 00:48:21,294
Not from the "Uchiha elite"
who was whining in fear back there!

777
00:48:21,891 --> 00:48:24,852
I-I got some dust in my eye and
started tearing up, that's all!

778
00:48:24,895 --> 00:48:27,690
Do you know the 25th rule
of Shinobi Conduct?

779
00:48:28,308 --> 00:48:31,479
The rule says a ninja must not
show tears!

780
00:48:33,043 --> 00:48:35,546
Hey...Stop it, you two...

781
00:48:36,198 --> 00:48:38,200
That's enough, both of you!

782
00:48:40,188 --> 00:48:43,651
Kakashi, rules and regulations
are indeed important.

783
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:47,113
But that isn't everything.
Didn't I teach you...?

784
00:48:47,689 --> 00:48:49,733
There are times when
the situation requires

785
00:48:49,758 --> 00:48:51,760
impromptu responses against the enemy.

786
00:48:53,739 --> 00:48:54,716
There, you see?!

787
00:48:54,741 --> 00:48:56,452
Obito, you too!

788
00:48:57,824 --> 00:49:00,660
There's no way dust can get into
your eyes when you have goggles on.

789
00:49:01,459 --> 00:49:04,179
If you're going to advocate self-control,
don't just mouth the words.

790
00:49:04,237 --> 00:49:05,822
Act strong too.

791
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,468
And one other thing...

792
00:49:08,605 --> 00:49:12,443
Kakashi...You shouldn't use
that jutsu anymore.

793
00:49:13,515 --> 00:49:14,659
From what I could see,

794
00:49:14,684 --> 00:49:19,564
your focal point concentrated attack
undoubtedly has power and speed...

795
00:49:19,689 --> 00:49:24,737
But it makes you move too fast to
ascertain the opponent's counterattack.

796
00:49:24,862 --> 00:49:26,655
It's still an imperfect jutsu.

797
00:49:28,532 --> 00:49:29,867
Before we part...

798
00:49:30,035 --> 00:49:31,870
I'll tell you one more thing.

799
00:49:32,496 --> 00:49:36,042
For a ninja, the most important thing
is teamwork.

800
00:49:45,154 --> 00:49:46,155
Sensei...

801
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:48,511
What's the matter?

802
00:49:55,436 --> 00:49:59,774
I know...
that teamwork is important.

803
00:50:00,489 --> 00:50:01,490
But...

804
00:50:02,123 --> 00:50:06,837
Kakashi always criticizes me about
how I lack discipline, so...

805
00:50:07,908 --> 00:50:13,705
I mean...I know that I'm the black sheep
of the elite Uchiha Clan...

806
00:50:14,614 --> 00:50:17,201
And I admit that Kakashi is
an awesome guy...

807
00:50:20,134 --> 00:50:23,029
Kakashi is the son of the genius ninja,
Sakumo Hatake,

808
00:50:23,157 --> 00:50:26,244
feared as the "White Fang" of the Leaf.

809
00:50:26,666 --> 00:50:30,087
Even the legendary names of
the Leaf's Three Great Ninja paled

810
00:50:30,112 --> 00:50:31,363
before his father's.

811
00:50:32,538 --> 00:50:35,708
His childhood years were spent
under the shadow of such a genius...

812
00:50:36,301 --> 00:50:41,014
So I guess it can't be helped if,
at times, he finds you lacking.

813
00:50:41,881 --> 00:50:43,133
White Fang...

814
00:50:43,648 --> 00:50:45,608
That's right...
I've heard of him too.

815
00:50:45,995 --> 00:50:48,581
The hero who died protecting the village.

816
00:50:49,285 --> 00:50:51,830
Kakashi never said a word about that...

817
00:50:55,267 --> 00:50:56,884
He was a great man...

818
00:50:56,985 --> 00:50:58,629
Someone respected by everyone
in the village,

819
00:50:58,671 --> 00:51:00,089
and naturally, by Kakashi himself.

820
00:51:04,135 --> 00:51:06,137
That is, until that incident...

821
00:51:07,138 --> 00:51:08,139
Incident?

822
00:51:08,381 --> 00:51:12,053
Perhaps, I shouldn't be telling you
something like this...

823
00:51:12,685 --> 00:51:14,997
But since you're on the same team
as Kakashi,

824
00:51:15,022 --> 00:51:16,356
I want you to know.

825
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:18,442
What happened...?

826
00:51:18,902 --> 00:51:21,165
Kakashi's father, Sakumo,

827
00:51:21,507 --> 00:51:24,887
took his own life
after being slandered.

828
00:51:27,285 --> 00:51:30,538
Five years ago, he was the leader
of an extremely difficult mission

829
00:51:30,563 --> 00:51:32,732
and infiltrated enemy territory.

830
00:51:33,228 --> 00:51:35,063
He was forced to make a choice.

831
00:51:36,048 --> 00:51:39,093
The mission or his comrades' lives...

832
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:43,127
Of course, according to
the rules of the village,

833
00:51:43,256 --> 00:51:45,218
completing the mission was
the right thing to do.

834
00:51:45,244 --> 00:51:47,364
However, in order to save
his comrades,

835
00:51:47,389 --> 00:51:49,141
he suspended the mission.

836
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:53,835
That resulted in grave losses to
the Land of Fire and the village,

837
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,611
and he was blamed for it.

838
00:51:56,344 --> 00:52:01,099
What's more, the very comrades
he saved also criticized him.

839
00:52:02,338 --> 00:52:04,508
The whole ordeal took its toll
on Sakumo's health,

840
00:52:04,533 --> 00:52:06,202
physically and mentally.

841
00:52:06,378 --> 00:52:07,578
And finally, he took his life.

842
00:52:14,941 --> 00:52:18,821
Since then, Kakashi has never
uttered a word about his father,

843
00:52:19,341 --> 00:52:22,260
and he has strictly adhered to
to every rule and regulation.

844
00:52:28,254 --> 00:52:29,256
Obito...

845
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:32,216
Try to understand,
even if it's just a little.

846
00:52:33,054 --> 00:52:35,139
Kakashi means well.

847
00:52:41,197 --> 00:52:42,741
It's healing well.

848
00:52:42,883 --> 00:52:45,970
But don't over-exert yourself
or you'll open up the wound.

849
00:52:46,103 --> 00:52:47,104
Yeah.

850
00:52:48,467 --> 00:52:49,510
Let's start heading out.

851
00:52:50,237 --> 00:52:51,238
- Yes sir!
- Yes sir!

852
00:52:52,113 --> 00:52:55,366
We'll be splitting up from this point.
Good luck to you all.

853
00:52:56,109 --> 00:52:59,487
The enemy the other day was
doing surveillance alone.

854
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:01,886
But from here on out,
we'll be fighting teams.

855
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,054
Be careful...

856
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:05,056
Let's get going...

857
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:06,641
Captain.

858
00:53:11,911 --> 00:53:13,245
All right...Let's go!

859
00:53:13,678 --> 00:53:14,679
- Yes sir!
- Yes sir!

860
00:53:14,743 --> 00:53:15,744
Scatter!

861
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:29,505
Hey...Mahiru went out for surveillance
and hasn't come back.

862
00:53:29,855 --> 00:53:33,526
You don't think those young brats
killed him, do you?

863
00:53:34,084 --> 00:53:35,878
Well then, let's ask them.

864
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:38,092
<i>Camouflage Jutsu</i>

865
00:53:47,602 --> 00:53:49,688
<i>Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!</i>

866
00:54:18,941 --> 00:54:20,985
We're taking this one.

867
00:54:23,372 --> 00:54:24,373
Wait!

868
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:30,200
Damn it!!

869
00:54:30,706 --> 00:54:32,374
Obito! Don't go after them!

870
00:54:37,045 --> 00:54:38,046
What?!

871
00:54:38,529 --> 00:54:41,199
Do you realize what you just said?!

872
00:54:41,368 --> 00:54:42,370
Yeah...

873
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,885
The two of us will continue this mission.

874
00:54:46,146 --> 00:54:48,773
And Rin? What about Rin?!

875
00:54:49,124 --> 00:54:50,209
Rin comes later.

876
00:54:51,126 --> 00:54:52,961
The enemy wants to find out
what we're up to.

877
00:54:53,659 --> 00:54:55,161
They won't kill her right away.

878
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:58,606
And luckily, Rin is a Medical Ninja.

879
00:54:59,035 --> 00:55:01,680
So even if she ends up a prisoner of war,
she'll probably be treated cordially...

880
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:04,268
On the condition that she treat
the wounded on their side.

881
00:55:04,988 --> 00:55:08,741
The problem is if the enemy learns
about our strategy.

882
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,081
If they obtain that information,
no doubt,

883
00:55:11,166 --> 00:55:13,877
they'll immediately increase
the security on the bridge.

884
00:55:14,323 --> 00:55:16,284
That will make our mission
much more difficult.

885
00:55:16,734 --> 00:55:20,613
You're assuming Rin's safety
under baseless assumptions!

886
00:55:21,005 --> 00:55:24,926
What if those guys just now are lackeys
who don't give a damn?!

887
00:55:25,054 --> 00:55:28,390
Right now, saving Rin takes priority
over the mission!

888
00:55:30,533 --> 00:55:31,826
A ninja...

889
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:35,423
must sacrifice a comrade in order
to carry out a mission.

890
00:55:36,106 --> 00:55:37,149
That's the rule.

891
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,501
If we fail in this mission,

892
00:55:39,526 --> 00:55:41,129
it is possible that the war
will be prolonged

893
00:55:41,222 --> 00:55:43,557
and many more lives will
be sacrificed.

894
00:55:43,895 --> 00:55:45,814
That's just an assumption!

895
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:47,535
And for something like that,

896
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,855
you're willing to simply abandon
a comrade

897
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,877
who's been through life and death
with you?!

898
00:55:52,253 --> 00:55:54,269
When you and I were wounded,

899
00:55:54,294 --> 00:55:57,380
Rin saved our lives with
her medical ninjutsu!

900
00:55:57,514 --> 00:56:01,601
If she hadn't been there,
we'd both be dead by now!

901
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:04,861
That was Rin's duty.

902
00:56:08,007 --> 00:56:09,842
I don't like you, after all!

903
00:56:10,226 --> 00:56:15,189
I don't care. I'm the captain.
You will obey me.

904
00:56:15,797 --> 00:56:19,360
Whatever the situation,
in order to keep the team together,

905
00:56:19,385 --> 00:56:20,720
one person gives the orders.

906
00:56:21,549 --> 00:56:23,467
That is why we have the rule
that states

907
00:56:23,492 --> 00:56:26,036
that members must obey
the team captain.

908
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:30,444
Obito, you're not strong.

909
00:56:30,734 --> 00:56:32,986
That is why I was chosen
as captain of this team.

910
00:56:34,615 --> 00:56:37,152
Then why won't you try to save Rin?!

911
00:56:37,756 --> 00:56:39,276
As captain, you're strong.

912
00:56:39,301 --> 00:56:41,550
Strong enough to save
your comrades, right?!

913
00:56:41,955 --> 00:56:44,626
If you give in to your emotions
even for a moment

914
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:47,879
and fail your mission,
you will regret it later.

915
00:56:48,767 --> 00:56:52,730
That is why our code of conduct
forbids any emotional feelings.

916
00:56:53,385 --> 00:56:54,969
You should know that.

917
00:56:57,864 --> 00:56:59,032
Rin...

918
00:56:59,475 --> 00:57:01,221
Rin was concerned about
your well-being.

919
00:57:01,246 --> 00:57:03,165
That's why she gave you that medkit.

920
00:57:04,355 --> 00:57:06,649
She even sewed on
a protective amulet inside it!

921
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:09,795
The medkit and medical ninjutsu
are superb systems

922
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:11,631
developed by the Hidden Leaf

923
00:57:11,715 --> 00:57:14,926
in order to increase
the success rate of our missions.

924
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:19,167
But I told you yesterday, didn't I?

925
00:57:19,891 --> 00:57:22,562
"Getting something useless would
only get in the way."

926
00:57:23,221 --> 00:57:24,472
Something useless?

927
00:57:27,967 --> 00:57:30,803
To carry out his mission,
useful tools are essential to a ninja.

928
00:57:31,589 --> 00:57:34,508
Something like emotions are useless.

929
00:57:42,724 --> 00:57:44,058
Are you serious...?!

930
00:57:48,444 --> 00:57:51,030
Do you seriously believe that?!

931
00:58:07,298 --> 00:58:09,300
Yeah...I do...

932
00:58:10,915 --> 00:58:11,916
Forget it.

933
00:58:12,428 --> 00:58:15,222
You and I have been like water
and oil from the start.

934
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:17,142
I'm going to rescue Rin!

935
00:58:19,310 --> 00:58:21,145
You don't understand anything...!

936
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:24,483
Not about what happens if
you break the rules...

937
00:58:27,594 --> 00:58:30,932
I believe that the White Fang
was a true hero...

938
00:58:34,327 --> 00:58:36,662
Sure in the world of ninja,

939
00:58:36,771 --> 00:58:40,191
those who break the rules and
regulations are regarded as scum...

940
00:58:41,233 --> 00:58:42,235
But...

941
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:47,591
those who abandon their comrades...
are worse than scum!

942
00:58:49,111 --> 00:58:52,531
I'm gonna be trash anyway,
so I choose to break the rules.

943
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:56,142
And if that doesn't make me
a true ninja...

944
00:58:57,906 --> 00:59:01,368
Then I'll destroy all
these so-called "ninja"!

945
00:59:32,983 --> 00:59:34,360
You finally came.

946
00:59:35,203 --> 00:59:36,247
What is the situation?

947
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:38,449
I'd say there are about fifty
of the enemy.

948
00:59:38,731 --> 00:59:42,151
Compared to that,
there are just four of us left alive.

949
00:59:46,884 --> 00:59:49,721
It'll all be over soon.
We will all attack at once.

950
00:59:51,775 --> 00:59:55,654
Everyone, please direct these kunai knives
towards the enemy all at once.

951
00:59:56,341 --> 00:59:58,051
I will do the rest...

952
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:01,893
That's crazy! Not even you could...

953
01:00:02,511 --> 01:00:04,262
Shut up and do as he says.

954
01:00:04,803 --> 01:00:08,098
We're about to see
the Yellow Flash of the Leaf in battle.

955
01:00:08,591 --> 01:00:11,260
It'll happen in a flash. Don't miss it.

956
01:00:16,982 --> 01:00:18,150
<i>I found them...</i>

957
01:00:19,586 --> 01:00:22,005
<i>Calm down...I can do this!</i>

958
01:00:27,854 --> 01:00:29,399
I'll take care of it.

959
01:00:29,913 --> 01:00:34,250
In the meantime, use your genjutsu
and get the information from her.

960
01:00:35,294 --> 01:00:37,046
<i>Camouflage Jutsu</i>

961
01:00:45,796 --> 01:00:47,632
All right...Here I go!

962
01:00:48,299 --> 01:00:49,300
Go where?

963
01:01:07,857 --> 01:01:11,069
K-Kakashi...How come you're...?!

964
01:01:11,590 --> 01:01:15,969
Well, I can't leave this up to
a crybaby ninja like you, can I?

965
01:01:16,704 --> 01:01:17,830
Kakashi...

966
01:01:19,226 --> 01:01:22,564
That silver-white hair and
white chakra blade...!

967
01:01:23,006 --> 01:01:26,176
Don't tell me you're...
the "White Fang" of the Leaf?!

968
01:01:27,332 --> 01:01:28,959
This is my father's keepsake.

969
01:01:30,488 --> 01:01:33,366
<i>To carry out his mission,
useful tools are essential to a ninja.</i>

970
01:01:33,909 --> 01:01:36,872
<i>Something like emotions are useless.</i>

971
01:01:38,831 --> 01:01:40,416
<i>Kakashi...you...</i>

972
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:44,155
I see...You're the White Fang's kid...

973
01:01:44,651 --> 01:01:46,695
Then there's no need to
be afraid of you.

974
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:53,467
<i>I thought so.</i>

975
01:01:54,267 --> 01:01:55,936
<i>The scent has been completely erased.</i>

976
01:01:56,453 --> 01:01:58,705
<i>We'll have to locate him</i>

977
01:01:58,833 --> 01:02:00,596
<i>by the slightest movement
and noise he makes.</i>

978
01:02:01,422 --> 01:02:03,091
<i>Wh-Where is he?</i>

979
01:02:07,015 --> 01:02:08,141
Obito, behind you!

980
01:02:15,268 --> 01:02:16,128
My eye...!

981
01:02:16,675 --> 01:02:17,676
Kakashi!

982
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:22,908
Hey Kakashi! Are you all right?!

983
01:02:28,699 --> 01:02:32,119
<i>Even if he's just a kid,
it doesn't hurt to be cautious...</i>

984
01:02:32,453 --> 01:02:33,871
<i>I'll take it nice and slow.</i>

985
01:02:34,955 --> 01:02:37,374
Our enemy...He's good...

986
01:02:37,857 --> 01:02:40,860
He threw away the kunai knife stained
with the smell of my blood.

987
01:02:44,215 --> 01:02:46,384
Don't tell me you got dust
in your eye again?

988
01:02:47,245 --> 01:02:48,788
A ninja shouldn't cry...

989
01:02:49,387 --> 01:02:50,889
I'm not dead yet.

990
01:02:51,539 --> 01:02:52,540
Stay focused!

991
01:02:55,227 --> 01:02:56,756
<i>There's no way dust can
get into your eyes</i>

992
01:02:56,781 --> 01:02:58,616
<i>when you have goggles on.</i>

993
01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:02,585
<i>If you're going to advocate self-control,
don't just mouth the words.</i>

994
01:03:02,610 --> 01:03:04,236
<i>Act strong too.</i>

995
01:03:04,945 --> 01:03:09,743
<i>I'm just talk...
Always being saved by others...</i>

996
01:03:10,744 --> 01:03:12,579
<i>Just a big-mouthed loser...</i>

997
01:03:13,764 --> 01:03:14,765
<i>But...</i>

998
01:03:15,866 --> 01:03:19,328
<i>I believe that the White Fang
was a true hero...</i>

999
01:03:20,648 --> 01:03:24,486
<i>Those who abandon their comrades...
are worse than scum!</i>

1000
01:03:25,972 --> 01:03:29,642
<i>I don't want those words
to be just empty talk!</i>

1001
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,201
Die!

1002
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:43,320
Wh-Why...?

1003
01:03:44,363 --> 01:03:45,948
There's no way you can see...

1004
01:03:46,615 --> 01:03:48,283
Obito...You...!

1005
01:03:56,408 --> 01:03:59,286
Wh-What is...that eye...?

1006
01:04:01,158 --> 01:04:03,662
This time...I'll protect my comrade!

1007
01:04:12,727 --> 01:04:14,854
Obito...That eye of yours...

1008
01:04:15,647 --> 01:04:18,483
Yeah...I guess this is the Sharingan.

1009
01:04:19,116 --> 01:04:21,493
I can now see the movement
and flow of chakra.

1010
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:26,241
Are you all right, Kakashi?!

1011
01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:27,931
Yeah...

1012
01:04:28,411 --> 01:04:30,913
Looks like I lost my left eye,

1013
01:04:31,469 --> 01:04:33,012
but I have the kit Rin gave me.

1014
01:04:33,815 --> 01:04:35,483
I can use it for emergency first-aid.

1015
01:04:36,109 --> 01:04:37,778
We're going to save Rin immediately!

1016
01:04:38,311 --> 01:04:39,312
Okay!

1017
01:04:49,875 --> 01:04:52,044
You're surprisingly stubborn.

1018
01:05:00,028 --> 01:05:03,364
Hmm...They're all so pathetic.

1019
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:12,958
The flow of Rin's chakra is disturbed...

1020
01:05:13,626 --> 01:05:15,878
It's different from your chakra
or mine.

1021
01:05:16,639 --> 01:05:18,474
She's probably under a genjutsu...

1022
01:05:19,093 --> 01:05:21,774
They didn't waste any time trying
to get the information out of her.

1023
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:25,722
It seems they're not mere kids.

1024
01:05:26,598 --> 01:05:30,060
We fought him earlier.
He's fast...Stay alert!

1025
01:05:30,323 --> 01:05:31,324
Right!

1026
01:06:10,065 --> 01:06:11,066
<i>Release!</i>

1027
01:06:12,262 --> 01:06:14,305
Kakashi...Obito...!

1028
01:06:15,276 --> 01:06:16,610
We've come to save you, Rin!

1029
01:06:17,538 --> 01:06:18,873
You'll be all right now.

1030
01:06:19,446 --> 01:06:21,782
All right, now let's get out of here!

1031
01:06:26,365 --> 01:06:27,449
I see...

1032
01:06:27,836 --> 01:06:31,091
You two made a good team,
but you're still just kids.

1033
01:06:32,109 --> 01:06:34,945
Right now, you're in enemy hands.

1034
01:06:37,342 --> 01:06:39,344
<i>Earth Style: Rock Breaker!</i>

1035
01:06:42,716 --> 01:06:43,717
This is bad!!

1036
01:06:44,050 --> 01:06:45,218
Run for the exit!

1037
01:06:54,066 --> 01:06:55,068
Kakashi!

1038
01:07:09,421 --> 01:07:11,799
Too bad, I lost a good source
of information...

1039
01:07:12,256 --> 01:07:14,258
Oh well, it can't be helped.

1040
01:07:27,335 --> 01:07:30,880
Are you all right?
Rin...? Kakashi...?

1041
01:07:32,858 --> 01:07:33,859
Obito!

1042
01:07:42,535 --> 01:07:45,705
Don't...It's okay, Kakashi.

1043
01:07:46,790 --> 01:07:49,877
I don't think...I'm gonna make it...

1044
01:07:51,253 --> 01:07:54,590
My right side is totally crushed.

1045
01:07:55,466 --> 01:07:56,717
I can't even feel anything...

1046
01:08:02,209 --> 01:08:03,210
Dammit!!

1047
01:08:04,669 --> 01:08:08,297
No...This can't be...Why...?

1048
01:08:10,688 --> 01:08:11,689
Obito...!

1049
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:19,951
Dammit!

1050
01:08:20,865 --> 01:08:21,991
Dammit!!

1051
01:08:22,912 --> 01:08:26,058
If...If only I had listened to you..

1052
01:08:26,083 --> 01:08:28,128
And we had come to rescue Rin
in the first place...

1053
01:08:28,293 --> 01:08:30,421
This never would've happened!

1054
01:08:37,094 --> 01:08:40,597
So what if I'm a captain?!
So what if I made jonin?!

1055
01:08:42,038 --> 01:08:45,541
Oh yeah...I almost forgot...

1056
01:08:48,905 --> 01:08:50,407
I was the only one who...

1057
01:08:50,775 --> 01:08:53,778
didn't give you a gift...

1058
01:08:54,342 --> 01:08:57,597
for becoming a jonin, Kakashi.

1059
01:09:01,367 --> 01:09:04,453
I didn't...know what to get you...

1060
01:09:05,287 --> 01:09:09,250
but...I think I know now.

1061
01:09:11,381 --> 01:09:13,633
Don't worry...

1062
01:09:14,093 --> 01:09:18,263
It's not some useless, extra baggage...

1063
01:09:22,262 --> 01:09:27,559
I'm giving you...my Sharingan.

1064
01:09:30,951 --> 01:09:33,787
Whatever the village may say...

1065
01:09:34,534 --> 01:09:37,454
you are...a great jonin.

1066
01:09:38,153 --> 01:09:41,323
That's how I really feel...

1067
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:43,578
So please accept it.

1068
01:09:48,251 --> 01:09:52,338
Rin...Use your medical ninjutsu...

1069
01:09:53,349 --> 01:09:56,895
Take the entire eye and transplant...
my Sharingan...

1070
01:09:56,920 --> 01:10:00,298
into Kakashi's left eye.

1071
01:10:03,051 --> 01:10:06,471
Kakashi, come over here...
I'll start it right away.

1072
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:11,240
I'm about to...die...

1073
01:10:12,373 --> 01:10:15,293
But...I'll become your eye and...

1074
01:10:15,912 --> 01:10:18,498
see the future...with you.

1075
01:10:32,715 --> 01:10:35,968
How stubborn...
You're still alive, huh?

1076
01:10:39,856 --> 01:10:42,527
But...you're just a kid, after all.

1077
01:10:43,012 --> 01:10:44,931
What's a ninja crying for?

1078
01:10:45,561 --> 01:10:48,564
Come on, crybaby! Let's settle this.

1079
01:11:04,073 --> 01:11:08,078
<i>That kid...
He seems different than before...</i>

1080
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:16,852
Kakashi...take care of...Rin.

1081
01:11:17,809 --> 01:11:18,810
Yeah...

1082
01:12:14,343 --> 01:12:17,013
Don't panic...Rin.

1083
01:12:26,223 --> 01:12:29,435
Kakashi...Take Rin...

1084
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:34,173
Take Rin and...get out...of here.

1085
01:12:35,293 --> 01:12:38,379
Enemy reinforcements...
will be coming.

1086
01:12:38,959 --> 01:12:39,960
Obito...

1087
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,402
It's okay...Just go...

1088
01:12:47,536 --> 01:12:48,537
Rin!

1089
01:12:57,847 --> 01:13:00,016
<i>Earth Style: Earthquake Slam!</i>

1090
01:13:04,732 --> 01:13:06,275
Rin, hurry, take my hand!

1091
01:13:06,752 --> 01:13:07,754
Rin!

1092
01:13:21,066 --> 01:13:22,067
Obito!!

1093
01:13:25,982 --> 01:13:30,528
<i>Just when Kakashi and I were...
starting to get along...</i>

1094
01:13:32,187 --> 01:13:36,442
<i>I couldn't tell Rin that I...
loved her...</i>

1095
01:13:38,224 --> 01:13:42,645
<i>I wish...I could've spent more time...
with everyone.</i>

1096
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:48,482
Obito!

1097
01:14:18,822 --> 01:14:20,699
<i>Damn it...!</i>

1098
01:14:24,687 --> 01:14:28,233
<i>Obito...This is the jutsu
you helped me perfect!</i>

1099
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:36,811
Hmm...You still have the will to fight,
even in this situation?

1100
01:14:37,179 --> 01:14:40,933
No wonder you were able to sneak
so deep into enemy territory.

1101
01:14:41,158 --> 01:14:42,451
You are a determined one.

1102
01:14:43,827 --> 01:14:47,664
Rin! I'll hold them off!
Get out now!

1103
01:14:48,089 --> 01:14:49,090
But...!

1104
01:14:49,454 --> 01:14:51,914
I promised Obito I'd look after you...

1105
01:14:52,664 --> 01:14:54,583
I'll protect you with my life!

1106
01:14:55,650 --> 01:14:56,651
Kakashi...

1107
01:14:57,859 --> 01:15:01,112
Rin...Obito cared about you.

1108
01:15:02,418 --> 01:15:03,629
He loved you...

1109
01:15:04,024 --> 01:15:05,365
You were everything to him.

1110
01:15:05,766 --> 01:15:08,353
That's why he gave his life
to protect you.

1111
01:15:15,730 --> 01:15:18,108
Then, Kakashi! You should know
my feelings for you...

1112
01:15:18,133 --> 01:15:19,134
I...

1113
01:15:19,866 --> 01:15:21,326
I tried to abandon you...

1114
01:15:21,359 --> 01:15:22,973
I'm nothing but scum.

1115
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:33,583
Rin, go!

1116
01:15:42,474 --> 01:15:45,162
<i>Am I...dead?</i>

1117
01:15:49,767 --> 01:15:50,894
Where am I?

1118
01:15:53,652 --> 01:15:55,252
Looks like
you've regained consciousness.

1119
01:15:55,406 --> 01:15:56,407
Huh?!

1120
01:15:56,768 --> 01:15:58,645
Sensei! But how...?

1121
01:15:59,490 --> 01:16:01,549
The writing on this kunai knife...

1122
01:16:01,574 --> 01:16:04,705
acts as a marker that I leap to
using the Transportation Technique.

1123
01:16:06,076 --> 01:16:07,620
Then...the enemy?

1124
01:16:08,470 --> 01:16:10,096
I took them all down...

1125
01:16:11,983 --> 01:16:12,776
Rin...

1126
01:16:12,958 --> 01:16:13,959
Where is Rin?!

1127
01:16:18,325 --> 01:16:21,537
I'm sorry
I couldn't make it in time, Kakashi...

1128
01:16:22,406 --> 01:16:24,742
Rin told me everything.

1129
01:16:38,919 --> 01:16:41,673
<i>The Third Great Ninja War.</i>

1130
01:16:41,698 --> 01:16:44,135
<i>With the sacrifice of
many nameless ninja,</i>

1131
01:16:44,297 --> 01:16:48,968
<i>this long war finally came to a close.</i>

1132
01:16:49,514 --> 01:16:53,518
<i>In its wake, it also left legends...</i>

1133
01:16:53,543 --> 01:16:55,519
<i>The stories of great heroes,</i>

1134
01:16:55,544 --> 01:16:57,355
<i>to be told and retold
for generations to come.</i>

1135
01:16:57,848 --> 01:16:59,976
<i>The Battle of Kannabi Bridge...</i>

1136
01:17:00,301 --> 01:17:03,322
<i>That day, two heroes were born
in the Hidden Leaf Village,</i>

1137
01:17:03,346 --> 01:17:06,307
<i>each with his own Sharingan.</i>

1138
01:17:06,866 --> 01:17:10,204
<i>One found his name engraved
on the memorial stone.</i>

1139
01:17:10,229 --> 01:17:14,024
<i>The other came to be known
as "Kakashi of the Sharingan."</i>

1140
01:17:14,178 --> 01:17:18,933
<i>In time, the tales of his bravery spanned
all borders, and beyond.</i>
