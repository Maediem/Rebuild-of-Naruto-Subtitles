1
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,552
Do you already know
his whereabouts?

2
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:36,637
Yes.

3
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,016
In that case, it will be easy...

4
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:41,975
Let's go.

5
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,564
Here it comes, here it comes.

6
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,651
Oh goodie, it's just like I thought.

7
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:55,824
Hidden Leaf Village...
has a high average score.

8
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,993
You're still doing such
a ridiculous thing?

9
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,955
Well yes, this is my research.

10
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,251
Old Man Homura and Koharu Sensei, huh?

11
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:10,839
I wonder what you advisers
want from me.

12
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,599
This is it.

13
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,146
Th-This is...

14
00:02:30,978 --> 00:02:32,578
Alot of time has passed since the death.

15
00:02:33,474 --> 00:02:36,352
It's probably before
the Chunin Exam began.

16
00:02:37,144 --> 00:02:39,897
I see, so that's it...

17
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:44,539
That Orochimaru!

18
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,295
After the murder of Lord Kazekage,

19
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:54,983
Orochimaru...or someone
like Kabuto played Kazekage...

20
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,594
How thoughtless we were...

21
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,644
That damn Sarutobi...

22
00:03:08,086 --> 00:03:10,213
Well, it's not that easy.

23
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:13,668
The one who was your opponent
was the renowned Hokage

24
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,237
deemed to be strongest of
all five great nations.

25
00:03:17,525 --> 00:03:21,529
However...you've done well.
Two out of the five Kages...

26
00:03:21,732 --> 00:03:23,150
Stop...

27
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:27,832
Stop giving me words of sympathy.

28
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,627
I will kill you!

29
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:37,508
Of course, I didn't mean to...

30
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,529
It's true that we didn't succeed
in bringing the village down...

31
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:45,391
On the other hand, another objective
of this plan, Sasuke Uchiha...

32
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,395
Your leash is now on him.

33
00:03:52,243 --> 00:03:57,373
In exchange for these arms
and all of my jutsu...

34
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:03,370
If we could have gotten our hands
on that Itachi Uchiha from the beginning,

35
00:04:03,395 --> 00:04:05,231
it wouldn't have been a problem.

36
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,624
However that's a dream that
can no longer come true.

37
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,711
He is stronger than I am.

38
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:20,802
That is why...I pulled myself out
from that organization...

39
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:22,859
The Hidden Village in the Sand
announced that

40
00:04:22,884 --> 00:04:25,971
everything was Orochimaru's handiwork.

41
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:31,771
In addition, at the moment of their
complete surrender to us, the Leaf Village

42
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:35,019
that wasn't a very important issue
any more.

43
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,112
Leaf Village has no choice but
to accept their surrender and proposition

44
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,822
in order to restore national power.

45
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:47,203
However, the current strength of
Leaf Village has dropped drastically.

46
00:04:48,084 --> 00:04:49,222
Under these conditions,

47
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:54,085
our top priority must be to prepare
for any unpredicted crisis.

48
00:04:54,751 --> 00:04:57,146
We don't know when any of
the neighboring nations

49
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:59,132
will come out in a bold move.

50
00:04:59,607 --> 00:05:02,610
Therefore, we've decided that until
the village gets its strength back,

51
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,722
we should assemble the top few men
from each troop,

52
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:10,421
and form an emergency
executive committee to handle this.

53
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,479
But first...

54
00:05:16,872 --> 00:05:19,583
We need a strong, trustworthy leader.

55
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,398
You can find the seeds of trouble
rolling around everywhere these days.

56
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,587
It's not just Orochimaru.

57
00:05:26,946 --> 00:05:30,992
You didn't have to go through
the trouble of informing me that.

58
00:05:32,029 --> 00:05:34,407
Well...I'll continue gathering materials.

59
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,003
I'm going to tell you the basic plan.

60
00:05:37,651 --> 00:05:40,863
We need the Fifth Hokage right away.

61
00:05:40,976 --> 00:05:46,023
And yesterday at an emergency meeting
with the feudal lord of the Land of Fire,

62
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:48,254
we decided
it would be you, Jiraiya.

63
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:52,727
I'm sorry, it's not my nature.

64
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,520
It has been decided.

65
00:05:54,829 --> 00:05:58,541
Besides, if a shinobi like you,
renowned as a Sannin, is not...

66
00:05:58,566 --> 00:05:59,609
then who is?

67
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,674
If you want a Sannin,
there is one more left...

68
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,118
That Tsunade.

69
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:15,583
Certainly that child probably
has that capability, but...

70
00:06:16,262 --> 00:06:18,978
However, no one knows where she is.

71
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:22,941
I'll find and bring her back.
If I do that there's no problem, right?

72
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:24,674
But...

73
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:30,360
A wise one like Tsunade is meant to
be Hokage more than I, with no motivation.

74
00:06:33,007 --> 00:06:34,175
What do you want to do?

75
00:06:36,884 --> 00:06:39,428
All right.
We'll give it urgent consideration.

76
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,535
However, we'll have three members
from ANBU Black Ops to accompany you

77
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,612
as the search unit for Tsunade.

78
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:50,118
Don't worry, I won't escape from this.
The guards are not necessary.

79
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,578
However...

80
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:57,792
There is one guy that I want
to take with me on my trip.

81
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,754
I've found an interesting egg...

82
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:09,846
Yo, you two!

83
00:07:11,374 --> 00:07:13,209
You seem to be getting along well.

84
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:17,437
Fool, Anko asked me to
buy rice dumplings. That's all.

85
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,398
What are you doing here?

86
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:26,028
While I'm here to buy offerings,
I've made plans to meet here...

87
00:07:27,188 --> 00:07:28,522
with Sasuke.

88
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:33,286
Huh, it's rare that you wait for people.

89
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,997
Is the offering to Obito?

90
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,497
Obito?

91
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,001
Well...that's about right.

92
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:50,878
Kakashi, it's strange for
you to be here first.

93
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,816
Well...once in a while.

94
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,358
I don't do natto or sweets.

95
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,486
Oh...Is that so?

96
00:08:11,807 --> 00:08:13,642
I...

97
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,745
I put it under my headband

98
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:20,650
in order not to drop the important ticket
during morning training.

99
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:27,507
Okay, that's fine...
Eat well and do your best.

100
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:28,673
Hmm?

101
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,802
You're going to do it again
after this, right? Training?

102
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,975
Of course! I'm full of motivation.

103
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,393
Good! Here you go.

104
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,441
Another serving for free! Go for it!

105
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,360
Thank you, sir!

106
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,780
Welcome.

107
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,077
Just like I heard...
I had to come and see it.

108
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,286
It seems that you really
are just eating ramen.

109
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,956
Oh, Pervy Sage!

110
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:13,052
I haven't seen you for
a while Asuma, Kurenai.

111
00:09:13,623 --> 00:09:18,503
If you know about us,
are you former Leaf shinobi?

112
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,020
- Huh?!
- Huh?!

113
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,982
Y-You are?!

114
00:09:33,605 --> 00:09:35,732
Humph, without a doubt...

115
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:37,868
Uchiha...

116
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,494
Itachi.

117
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,831
You are acquaintances of Itachi?

118
00:09:43,682 --> 00:09:44,682
If so...

119
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,903
I'll introduce myself as well.

120
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,717
I'm Kisame Hoshigaki.

121
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,177
Hereafter, I hope to be familiar with you.

122
00:09:57,448 --> 00:10:02,203
Never mind later,
I'm going to beat you now!

123
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,811
Itachi...

124
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:07,898
It seems you're pretty unpopular
in the village too.

125
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:09,734
I know you, too.

126
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,777
Kisame Hoshigake,

127
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,902
originally a shinobi
of Hidden Village in the Mist.

128
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,366
Suspected of national covert activities
and of killing a feudal lord,

129
00:10:17,642 --> 00:10:21,229
a Rogue ninja from Land of Water,
on the wanted list in all nations.

130
00:10:22,014 --> 00:10:26,686
You're a major S-rank criminal
listed in the Bingo Book.

131
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,674
This guy is pretty annoying.
Should we kill him?

132
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,022
It doesn't look like we are able
to leave the village so smoothly...

133
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:42,099
But don't overdo it,
your techniques tend to stand out.

134
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,769
They're done for then.

135
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:11,544
<i>This is...</i>

136
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,090
<i>Genjutsu.</i>

137
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:26,686
<i>Pressing down with the tip of his sword...
What strength.</i>

138
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,024
My large sword, Shark Skin...

139
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:44,078
doesn't cut, but lops it off!

140
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,045
Kurenai...You're late.

141
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:15,609
It's over!

142
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,952
Genjutsu of that level doesn't work on me.

143
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,205
<i>This is...genjutsu reversal?</i>

144
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,054
Kurenai!

145
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,515
There's no time to look away.

146
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,144
That's what's expected from you, Kurenai.

147
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:50,895
But...

148
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,606
"But this is as far as it goes..."

149
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:55,858
For you.

150
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,778
<i>What?!</i>

151
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,453
<i>Water Style!</i>

152
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,834
<i>- Water Shark Bomb Jutsu!
- Water Shark Bomb Jutsu!</i>

153
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,134
The same jutsu as me?!

154
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,262
Why have you shown up too?

155
00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:29,795
Well...I asked you to take care
of them earlier.

156
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,645
But I kinda felt uneasy, you know.

157
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,231
Hatake...

158
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,649
Kakashi.

159
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,423
<i>Those eyes are exactly the same
as they used to be in the past.</i>

160
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,365
<i>That being said,
he is a true inheritor of the Sharingan...</i>

161
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,410
<i>I have to assume the worst case scenario,
just in case.</i>

162
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,290
This is a surprise...
No wonder you copied my jutsu...

163
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:58,542
So there really is a fellow
besides Itachi who has that eye.

164
00:13:59,316 --> 00:14:02,319
Your name is Kakashi,
the copy ninja, wasn't it?

165
00:14:03,082 --> 00:14:04,917
I'm the one who was surprised.

166
00:14:05,408 --> 00:14:08,828
I saw strange men in the tea house
and wondered who they were...

167
00:14:09,742 --> 00:14:12,077
There they were, Itachi Uchiha and...

168
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:16,355
the Mystery Man of Hidden Mist Village
Kisame Hoshigaki.

169
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:21,443
Well, well...You know even my name.
It's an honor.

170
00:14:22,372 --> 00:14:26,376
I see. You're one of the
"Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist."

171
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,493
That huge sword is the "Shark Skin," right

172
00:14:31,992 --> 00:14:35,955
I heard that kid Zabuza
had it out with you?

173
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:38,067
Yeah...

174
00:14:43,338 --> 00:14:45,716
You are someone who's
well worth lopping off...

175
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,887
Stop it...Kisame.

176
00:14:51,615 --> 00:14:55,828
If you were to go at it with that man,
it won't end without cost.

177
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:00,983
And if you spend too much time,
another shinobi would come running.

178
00:15:01,304 --> 00:15:02,304
However...

179
00:15:02,774 --> 00:15:08,071
Don't lose sight of the goal...
You didn't come here to get injured!

180
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,368
Let me hear that goal then?

181
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,415
Just came to find something
we're looking for.

182
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,043
Something you're looking for?

183
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,892
I'm different from Kisame,
I won't take time.

184
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,610
<i>Water Style: Water Wall!</i>

185
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:51,159
<i>That's some jutsu speed.
My eyes couldn't follow his signs.</i>

186
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,994
<i>That shuriken in the right hand
was a decoy...</i>

187
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,891
<i>to use a Water Style Jutsu to launch
an attack below my foot...</i>

188
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,541
That's what to expect from you, Kakashi.

189
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:02,999
Your power of analytical eye...is great.

190
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,508
A Shadow Clone?!
His jutsu speed is too fast!

191
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:11,929
<i>A Water Clone?!</i>

192
00:16:14,067 --> 00:16:17,904
<i>The copy ninja has done well this far
with jutsu of my village.</i>

193
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:21,939
Nice! Kakashi!

194
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:23,773
Get down, Kurenai!

195
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,443
This one is the Shadow Clone...

196
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,568
Huh?

197
00:16:29,473 --> 00:16:30,891
Kakashi! Kurenai!

198
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,034
<i>He made the Shadow Clone
body explode?!</i>

199
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:41,874
Kakashi!

200
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,008
Don't lower your guard...

201
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:52,594
He's the guy who became a division chief
of ANBU Black Ops at 13 years old...

202
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,637
I didn't expect that someone
not of the Uchiha clan

203
00:16:55,662 --> 00:16:58,248
would have mastered
the Sharingan to that extent...

204
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:04,189
But your body isn't the Uchiha clan body
that goes with the eye.

205
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:08,235
<i>That's right. As a result,
my stamina doesn't last...</i>

206
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:13,991
There's a reason why the Uchiha Clan
was deemed the strongest and feared...

207
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,410
<i>I-It can't be!</i>

208
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,280
<i>This is bad!</i>

209
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:20,724
Both of you! Don't look at his eyes!

210
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,170
Both of you,
absolutely do not open your eyes...

211
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,505
It's all over now if your eyes meet.

212
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:32,468
Only people with Sharingan
can have a go with that technique.

213
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:35,078
Indeed with Sharingan,

214
00:17:35,442 --> 00:17:38,653
you can resist this Mangekyo Sharingan
to a certain extent.

215
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:40,808
However...

216
00:17:42,786 --> 00:17:45,289
this special visual jutsu of Sharingan,

217
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:48,523
<i>Genjutsu: Tsukuyomi, Nightmare Realm</i>,
is unbreakable.

218
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,254
The only person who can bring me down
is someone

219
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,032
using the same kekkei genkai,
a Sharingan user...

220
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,451
<i>Sasuke...</i>

221
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:19,181
<i>I wonder how much you can take
without the kekkei genkai?</i>

222
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,604
<i>In the world of Tsukuyomi...</i>

223
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,483
<i>Both space and time...</i>

224
00:18:32,292 --> 00:18:34,961
<i>and mass...
I control them all.</i>

225
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,827
<i>For the next 72 hours...</i>

226
00:18:40,246 --> 00:18:42,665
<i>I'll stab you continually with swords.</i>

227
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,846
What happened, Kakashi?!

228
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,009
Are you saying we should keep
our eyes closed still?!

229
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,103
N-Not...yet...

230
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:07,353
What happened?!

231
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:10,816
Just as that guy finished speaking,
you suddenly fell over!

232
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:18,949
<i>Three days in that world is less than
a moment in the actual world, huh...</i>

233
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,953
<i>But...why doesn't he kill me?</i>

234
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,123
<i>He could easily do so, if he wants to...</i>

235
00:19:27,093 --> 00:19:31,640
Whoa...To take that jutsu without causing
his spirit to collapse.

236
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,505
But Itachi...

237
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,551
it's also dangerous for you
to overuse those eyes.

238
00:19:42,118 --> 00:19:43,870
The thing you're looking for...

239
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,828
is it Sasuke?

240
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:52,608
No...the legacy of the Fourth Hokage...

241
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,909
<i>These guys.
What the heck are they planning...?</i>

242
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,411
<i>So, Naruto, is it...?</i>

243
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,538
It's been a long time...

244
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:11,001
How many years has it been
since you returned to the village?

245
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,670
Kakashi...

246
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,760
I will keep Naruto under my care.

247
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:22,846
I can understand why
the Third Hokage

248
00:20:22,871 --> 00:20:26,416
appointed you to
the role of watching over Naruto...

249
00:20:26,754 --> 00:20:31,133
But even at your level,
you may not be able to handle it properly.

250
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,482
What in the world are you saying?

251
00:20:34,251 --> 00:20:39,423
I've been observing Orochimaru
ever since he left the village...

252
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:45,224
It was obvious that he would return
to this village sooner or later.

253
00:20:46,102 --> 00:20:50,064
All told, at first I was concerned
only about him, but...

254
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,209
What is it?

255
00:20:54,187 --> 00:20:56,690
The guy joined an organization.

256
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,355
What are the details of the organization?

257
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,345
I don't know much of the details,

258
00:21:03,673 --> 00:21:07,886
but it's a small organization known
as Akatsuki made up of nine shinobi.

259
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:12,062
Until recently, they weren't making
any dramatic moves

260
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,504
except some cloak and dagger activities.

261
00:21:14,529 --> 00:21:16,729
The biggest concern is
the members of that organization.

262
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,596
Almost all of them are listed
on the Bingo Book,

263
00:21:20,766 --> 00:21:24,793
all S-rank deviant criminals.

264
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,663
That Itachi is among them.

265
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:35,361
If the nine of them get together,
their intent will not be charity work.

266
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:40,549
But recently, Orochimaru pulled out
of the organization.

267
00:21:40,983 --> 00:21:42,693
And at that time,

268
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:46,201
other members of the organization
went in to action in different areas,

269
00:21:46,226 --> 00:21:48,394
in pairs gathering jutsu and things.

270
00:21:49,367 --> 00:21:52,454
Is there proof that one of those
things is the Nine-Tailed Fox?

271
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,981
It's possible.

272
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,940
Kakashi...

273
00:21:58,134 --> 00:22:03,473
Sooner or later, Naruto will have
to live watching his back...

274
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,284
That's his destiny.

275
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,204
For now, you should keep
your eyes on Sasuke.

276
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:15,125
It's necessary for you to teach him
how to use his Sharingan.

277
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:19,921
I'll take care of Naruto for a while.

278
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:27,344
The Nine-Tailed Fox inside Naruto
is your target?

279
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:34,603
I know that you two aren't
the only ones on the move...

280
00:22:36,426 --> 00:22:40,326
The name of your organization is
Akatsuki, right?

281
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,321
Akatsuki?

282
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:49,951
Kisame! We'll take Kakashi.
Erase the other two.

283
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,295
<i>Severe Leaf Hurricane!</i>

284
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,136
Who are you?

285
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,808
The Leaf's noble, blue fierce animal...

286
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:14,935
Might Guy!

287
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:19,564
What a sight...
Shouldn't you be called a strange beast?

288
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,858
Don't underestimate that man...

289
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,903
<i>That man is Itachi!</i>

290
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,831
You did this to Kakashi...?

291
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:40,377
Don't look at Itachi's eyes, Guy!
You'll be caught up in his jutsu!

292
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,796
I know that already!

293
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:48,218
In order to fight Kakashi,
I devised ways to battle the Sharingan.

294
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,722
Open your eyes, both of you!

295
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,391
B-But...

296
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,102
When you battle with the Sharingan,

297
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,271
it's not a problem if
you don't look at those eyes!

298
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,258
You work around it by
gaining insight into his movements

299
00:24:02,283 --> 00:24:04,202
by looking constantly at his feet.

300
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,780
Now that you mention it,
you're probably right, but...

301
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,534
You're the only one who can do that.

302
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:13,868
That's true...

303
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,037
There's a knack to reading

304
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,248
all of your opponents movements
only by his feet.

305
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:21,084
But I can't teach it to you
in this emergency.

306
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,336
Just get used it right now!

307
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,046
What should we do?

308
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,383
Kurenai, get Kakashi to the medical team.

309
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,428
Asuma, you are my back up!

310
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:32,595
Okay!

311
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:38,143
And until the reinforcements of
ANBU Black Ops I arranged for arrive,

312
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:41,521
I will hang out with you guys.

313
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:44,733
Interesting...
That's some nerve...

314
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,069
Kisame...We're pulling out.

315
00:24:49,261 --> 00:24:51,513
We didn't come to have a war.

316
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,546
It's too bad,
but no more of this nonsense.

317
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,243
We're leaving.

318
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:59,748
Too bad...I was finally feeling motivated

319
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,375
It can't be helped.

320
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,453
What?! Why?! Why?!

321
00:25:10,478 --> 00:25:14,941
Why do I have to go on a research trip
with you, Pervy Sage?

322
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,724
Oh no, this isn't just any research trip.

323
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:21,870
There's a woman whose data
I want to collect.

324
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,396
So we have to look for her first.

325
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:27,400
I really don't have time to accompany you
on your perverted research trip!

326
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,540
Because I have training

327
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,363
Hm? Training

328
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:35,634
I will take lessons from Kakashi Sensei
and learn a variety of things, like Chidori

329
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:40,247
<i>Kakashi Sensei has been
playing favorites lately!</i>

330
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:46,253
Well, I think that technique
is impossible for you to learn.

331
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:51,591
More importantly...
That woman is really beautiful.

332
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,051
You want to meet her, don't you?!

333
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,386
Not at all.

334
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:59,808
I'm not some kid who can
be cajoled by you, Pervy Sage!

335
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,560
Anyway, no!

336
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,813
Well, it can't be helped...

337
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:09,943
Oh, well...I know jutsu more amazing
than Chidori, but...

338
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:14,665
It can't be helped...
Maybe I'll take Sasuke?

339
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:17,993
Of course I'll go!

340
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,996
I'll pack my bags right away.

341
00:26:21,522 --> 00:26:24,567
Pervy Sage, don't move!

342
00:26:27,603 --> 00:26:31,023
I'll be darned...He's really a cute kid.

343
00:26:34,639 --> 00:26:35,723
All right!

344
00:26:42,925 --> 00:26:48,915
Hey, Pervy Sage. What jutsu are you
gonna teach me this time?

345
00:26:49,147 --> 00:26:54,361
The last time was Walk on Water Jutsu,
so is it gonna be Walk on Fire Jutsu?

346
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:58,283
Or maybe Walk in the Air?

347
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:03,038
Hurry up and tell me, Pervy Sage!

348
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,060
You keep calling me Pervy Sage.

349
00:27:07,184 --> 00:27:10,187
So you have no idea that
I'm a superb person, huh?

350
00:27:10,258 --> 00:27:12,760
Huh...? A superb Pervy Sage?

351
00:27:13,971 --> 00:27:15,848
Nhaagh...Listen carefully!

352
00:27:18,205 --> 00:27:20,749
Toad Sage is only a disguise!

353
00:27:21,781 --> 00:27:25,243
As a matter of fact...!

354
00:27:26,052 --> 00:27:28,346
North and South and East and West!

355
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,733
I'm the white maned toad charmer,

356
00:27:31,758 --> 00:27:35,545
and one of the legendary Sannin whom
even celestial beings can't defeat.

357
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,738
Such a stud!

358
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,740
That he strikes fear...
in the hearts of people!

359
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:41,326
I am no other than "Master Jiraiya"!

360
00:27:42,706 --> 00:27:47,711
Yes...
I'm talking about me!

361
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:50,673
Huh...

362
00:28:08,613 --> 00:28:12,617
Atafuku Town?
That's ten kilometers from here!

363
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,984
It's "O" tafuku Town!

364
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:18,972
Hey...hey...
Hey, Pervy Sage!

365
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:23,535
I'm telling you, it's Jiraiya.
Gimme a break...

366
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,907
So the fact that such
a bigwig Pervy Sage like you

367
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:29,624
is taking me along as
his travel companion means...

368
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:32,977
that I'm potentially a genius?

369
00:28:33,075 --> 00:28:34,410
Just as I thought!

370
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,468
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Why did you choose me?

371
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:47,767
A long time ago
the Fourth Hokage was my disciple.

372
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:54,524
And you resemble the Fourth Hokage
so much, it's almost funny.

373
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,761
That's the only reason...

374
00:28:59,049 --> 00:29:00,426
I...?

375
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,283
The Fourth Hokage...?

376
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,120
Yeah!

377
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:08,480
Yeah! Yeah!

378
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,248
W-What is it?

379
00:29:10,273 --> 00:29:12,071
Yeah!

380
00:29:12,981 --> 00:29:14,978
The fact that I resemble
the Fourth Hokage means

381
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,380
that I also possess genius
of his level, right?

382
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:20,842
I'll become the Hokage, after all!
All right!

383
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,311
W-Wait...

384
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,442
I stepped on some dog poop!

385
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,632
<i>I wasn't...
I wasn't able to do anything...</i>

386
00:30:02,052 --> 00:30:09,225
<i>I don't want to watch a precious comrade
die right before my eyes ever again...</i>

387
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:17,732
<i>No matter what,
I will protect you!</i>

388
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,110
<i>Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

389
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,494
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

390
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:42,090
<i>Naruto is getting stronger and stronger.</i>

391
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:46,302
<i>Compared to him, I...</i>

392
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:09,970
While you may able to
manage against him,

393
00:31:10,016 --> 00:31:12,227
I couldn't possibly...

394
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,664
He's in a completely different level...

395
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,332
Yeah...

396
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:19,919
If we go at each other,
we'll either both be killed or at best,

397
00:31:20,176 --> 00:31:22,803
kill each other simultaneously.

398
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:27,302
Even if we increased the numbers,
that wouldn't change

399
00:31:27,843 --> 00:31:31,305
I didn't expect the kid's guard
would be a legendary Sannin.

400
00:31:31,673 --> 00:31:33,091
With him as the opponent...

401
00:31:33,456 --> 00:31:35,827
the names of Leaf Village's Uchiha Clan

402
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:39,981
and the Seven Ninja Swordsmen
of Mist would be tarnished.

403
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,525
Yeah. However...

404
00:31:43,431 --> 00:31:47,476
Every one has a weakness...

405
00:32:03,731 --> 00:32:07,944
It appears that they haven't
found Naruto yet.

406
00:32:08,137 --> 00:32:11,056
But don't you think that's strange!?

407
00:32:12,161 --> 00:32:15,289
Those guys had already
infiltrated the village.

408
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:18,224
It should be easy to find Naruto
in this village.

409
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:23,107
Itachi knows Naruto's face.

410
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:26,301
Kakashi...

411
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,031
Why is Kakashi sleeping?

412
00:32:30,118 --> 00:32:32,036
Besides, only jonin are gathering here...

413
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:34,953
What are you doing?
What in the world happened?!

414
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:37,872
Nothing...in particular...

415
00:32:37,897 --> 00:32:40,024
Is it true that that
Itachi has returned?!

416
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,529
And moreover,
that he's after Naruto?!

417
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:44,795
Oh...

418
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:46,923
Idiot...

419
00:32:53,297 --> 00:32:55,197
Why does this always happen?!

420
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:06,484
<i>So that guy returned to this village?
And moreover, he's pursuing Naruto?</i>

421
00:33:06,509 --> 00:33:07,761
<i>What does all this mean?!</i>

422
00:33:08,055 --> 00:33:10,295
<i>If Naruto is caught by him
he's as good as dead.</i>

423
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,013
<i>I'm not gonna let that happen!</i>

424
00:33:14,943 --> 00:33:17,654
Hey old man!
Naruto must have come here!

425
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:20,291
And do you know
where he went after that?

426
00:33:20,411 --> 00:33:22,204
Oh, Naruto, right...

427
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,335
If I remember correctly...

428
00:33:25,176 --> 00:33:27,526
Master Jiraiya came here
around noon and...

429
00:33:28,218 --> 00:33:32,014
They ate ramen together,
and he said he was going somewhere...

430
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:33,243
Where?!

431
00:33:33,513 --> 00:33:38,453
Hmm...I think he said to a post station
some distance from the village...

432
00:33:40,776 --> 00:33:43,154
And then he left with Master Jiraiya.

433
00:33:43,567 --> 00:33:44,568
Jiraiya?

434
00:33:45,892 --> 00:33:48,854
Jiraiya - one of the genius Sannin.

435
00:33:49,502 --> 00:33:51,499
Well, in appearance,

436
00:33:51,524 --> 00:33:54,027
he just looks like
a big white haired old man.

437
00:33:54,704 --> 00:33:57,040
Big and white-haired...

438
00:34:06,713 --> 00:34:08,257
Candies are here.

439
00:34:11,527 --> 00:34:12,859
Naruto!

440
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:13,676
Huh?

441
00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:15,610
We're staying here tonight!

442
00:34:15,695 --> 00:34:18,531
What?! I can still walk!

443
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:21,184
A disciple should obey his master!

444
00:34:21,527 --> 00:34:23,654
I just want to learn the jutsu!

445
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,272
That's what's called a disciple!

446
00:34:26,801 --> 00:34:27,801
Huh?!

447
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:40,578
Oh, oh...!

448
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,960
Naruto!

449
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,419
Yes?

450
00:34:50,803 --> 00:34:52,527
Here, this is the key to the room.

451
00:34:52,574 --> 00:34:54,101
Go to the room ahead of me,
practice chakra,

452
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:55,426
train some and go to sleep!

453
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:56,291
Got it?!

454
00:34:56,316 --> 00:34:57,234
What?!

455
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,889
"The adult world is gonna begin
from this point on"...

456
00:34:59,914 --> 00:35:02,292
Is that the vibe, Pervy Sage?!
That's not fair!

457
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,765
That post town isn't that far...!

458
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:12,777
This! Somehow this always happens
when I'm with that Pervy Sage!

459
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:17,519
<i>Darn...</i>

460
00:35:18,956 --> 00:35:19,998
<i>Here...</i>

461
00:35:27,482 --> 00:35:28,942
Candies are here!

462
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,006
I've got to check door by door!

463
00:35:35,443 --> 00:35:38,820
Do you have a blonde kid with
a dumb-looking face, about my age

464
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:41,264
and a big white haired old man
staying here?

465
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:42,640
White haired...?

466
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:43,723
Are they here?!

467
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:47,061
Eh...Do I remember seeing
some people like that earlier

468
00:35:47,086 --> 00:35:48,427
when shifts changed...?

469
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:54,110
This tastes bitter...
are you all right with it? Cheers!

470
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:58,172
Oh! A blond kid and
a white haired old man!

471
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:00,283
They're here?!
What's their room number!

472
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,660
Um...

473
00:36:02,715 --> 00:36:04,634
Room number one at
the end of the hallway

474
00:36:04,659 --> 00:36:06,038
on the second floor...

475
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:24,307
What's up?
Has she already dumped you?

476
00:36:25,605 --> 00:36:27,440
Okay, Okay!

477
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,398
Okay, Okay, I'll open up!

478
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,358
Naruto!

479
00:36:39,543 --> 00:36:40,424
It's not him...

480
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,802
<i>Sasuke...?</i>

481
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,640
<i>No...Who is he?</i>

482
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,017
<i>He's got the same Sharingan
as Sasuke.</i>

483
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,187
Really...

484
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,832
who'd believe a kid like you to
have the Nine-Tailed Fox in him.

485
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:20,411
<i>Why does that guy know
about the Nine-Tailed Fox?!</i>

486
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:24,700
Naruto, you will come with us.

487
00:37:29,764 --> 00:37:31,558
<i>That guy is...close by!</i>

488
00:37:34,474 --> 00:37:35,517
<i>That guy!</i>

489
00:37:36,285 --> 00:37:37,661
Shall we go outside...?

490
00:37:39,816 --> 00:37:42,152
<i>These guys aren't just anybody...</i>

491
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:52,144
Itachi, it'll be a pain in the neck
if this kid moves around and...

492
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:55,856
Maybe I better chop off
a leg just in case...

493
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:58,526
<i>W-What did he say?!</i>

494
00:37:59,366 --> 00:38:00,534
Now then...

495
00:38:13,212 --> 00:38:14,422
Long time no see...

496
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:20,798
Sasuke.

497
00:38:21,379 --> 00:38:23,381
Itachi Uchiha…

498
00:38:24,743 --> 00:38:25,827
I will…

499
00:38:27,618 --> 00:38:28,785
Kill you!

500
00:38:29,865 --> 00:38:32,410
Oh…the Sharingan.

501
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,312
Just who is he?

502
00:38:34,914 --> 00:38:36,832
My little brother.

503
00:38:38,001 --> 00:38:43,757
I had heard that the Uchiha Clan
had been annihilated…by you.

504
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:47,578
<i>So this is the man
Sasuke was talking about…</i>

505
00:38:47,603 --> 00:38:49,105
<i>The one he wants to kill!</i>

506
00:38:54,284 --> 00:38:56,119
It's just as you've said.

507
00:38:56,695 --> 00:39:00,783
I've hated you and resented you.

508
00:39:00,808 --> 00:39:03,936
For the singular purpose
of killing you…

509
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:08,637
I have lived my life!

510
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:29,773
Sasuke!

511
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:31,529
Damn it!

512
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:34,914
Maybe I should cut off those arms!

513
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,009
Master Jiraiya…

514
00:39:47,529 --> 00:39:49,864
So your target is Naruto, after all?

515
00:39:50,363 --> 00:39:56,036
To take Naruto is the overriding mission
we have been assigned by the Akatsuki.

516
00:40:00,956 --> 00:40:04,084
I can't let you have Naruto.

517
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,404
I wonder about that…

518
00:40:08,628 --> 00:40:12,549
Perfect timing. I will get rid of
both of you right here.

519
00:40:12,634 --> 00:40:14,177
Don't interfere.

520
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:25,256
If anyone is going to kill him,

521
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:28,551
it will be me.

522
00:40:29,633 --> 00:40:32,302
I have no interest in you right now.

523
00:40:33,481 --> 00:40:34,451
Sasuke!

524
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,045
Damn it!

525
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:41,882
Naruto!

526
00:40:41,907 --> 00:40:43,659
I said not to interfere!

527
00:40:45,851 --> 00:40:47,811
This is my fight!

528
00:40:52,773 --> 00:40:54,358
<i>Revenge…</i>

529
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,669
Fine!

530
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:09,884
<i>Why? I haven't closed the gap at all.</i>

531
00:41:10,596 --> 00:41:12,138
<i>What is this difference?</i>

532
00:41:20,415 --> 00:41:24,294
<i>I've trained for so long,
just to kill him.</i>

533
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,442
<i>For so long!</i>

534
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:32,106
<i>What have I been doing
all this time?!</i>

535
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:37,411
<i>Just what…?</i>

536
00:41:43,855 --> 00:41:45,523
<i>You are weak.</i>

537
00:41:46,825 --> 00:41:49,150
<i>From now, for 24 hours…</i>

538
00:41:49,175 --> 00:41:51,052
<i>Go back to that day.</i>

539
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,393
That's enough…

540
00:42:01,543 --> 00:42:02,720
outta you!

541
00:42:11,701 --> 00:42:14,245
<i>Ninja Art: Toad Mouth Trap.</i>

542
00:42:15,036 --> 00:42:17,696
Too bad, Itachi…Kisame.

543
00:42:22,601 --> 00:42:25,312
You are in my belly now!

544
00:42:25,636 --> 00:42:29,389
I've summoned the digestive tract
of the Giant Toad of Mount Myoboku.

545
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:32,299
You are wanted criminals anyway.

546
00:42:32,481 --> 00:42:35,609
I'll just feed you to the rock toad.

547
00:42:37,728 --> 00:42:41,356
You are weak
because you don't have enough…

548
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:43,620
hatred.

549
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:45,312
Come, Kisame!

550
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,207
Damn!

551
00:42:46,411 --> 00:42:47,536
Wait!

552
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:49,358
Why you—!

553
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:53,862
No one's ever escaped
this jutsu before!

554
00:43:00,962 --> 00:43:01,963
Pervy Sage!

555
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:05,291
What's the matter?!

556
00:43:06,889 --> 00:43:07,889
Huh!

557
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,953
They're gone!

558
00:43:15,483 --> 00:43:19,570
<i>I cannot believe that this wall
has been torn through...</i>

559
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:28,030
Why must we retreat?
You would be...

560
00:43:29,288 --> 00:43:32,417
We have no reason to rush to
get Naruto in the current condition.

561
00:43:33,231 --> 00:43:38,653
Besides, I have to rest
my body somewhere for a while.

562
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,456
<i>Not just Tsukuyomi,</i>

563
00:43:46,114 --> 00:43:48,867
<i>but he also made me
use Amaterasu as well...</i>

564
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:01,438
What is this fire?

565
00:44:01,822 --> 00:44:03,014
It's black...

566
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:04,332
Don't get so close!

567
00:44:08,606 --> 00:44:12,026
<i>How did those guys manage to get out?</i>

568
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,234
<i>Not only that...</i>

569
00:44:15,469 --> 00:44:17,513
<i>What are these black flames?</i>

570
00:44:18,685 --> 00:44:22,606
<i>The stone toad who has the ability
to blow fire had its intestine's burned...</i>

571
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:27,789
Huh?

572
00:44:35,818 --> 00:44:36,986
All right!

573
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,261
<i>Sealing Jutsu: Fire Seal!</i>

574
00:45:09,204 --> 00:45:13,876
All right! It'll be okay for now.

575
00:45:14,561 --> 00:45:15,854
Now for Sasuke!

576
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:21,884
Sasuke!

577
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:46,451
<i>Sasuke...</i>

578
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,667
<i>Dynamic...</i>

579
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:54,543
Guy?!

580
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:56,295
<i>Entry!</i>

581
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:08,836
Well...Eh...

582
00:46:08,861 --> 00:46:11,447
I'm sorry to have kicked you so directly.

583
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:14,688
I was in a rush and I forgot my mirror...

584
00:46:17,165 --> 00:46:20,085
I used this headband instead,
but it was hard to see.

585
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,196
And I assumed this rough hewn face
was the enemy...

586
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:25,115
I just let the flames of
the burning juvenescence take over me...

587
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:26,408
I'm sorry!

588
00:46:26,512 --> 00:46:30,140
Is that...supposed to be an apology?

589
00:46:30,772 --> 00:46:32,982
I'm a simple minded guy
just like how my face looks.

590
00:46:33,577 --> 00:46:35,454
It doesn't really matter.

591
00:46:36,105 --> 00:46:39,104
More importantly, we have to get Sasuke
to the Medical Team!

592
00:46:39,161 --> 00:46:39,912
Yes!

593
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:43,008
He's broken his arm and ribs.

594
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,186
Not only that, he's lost consciousness

595
00:46:46,211 --> 00:46:48,731
from some kind of mental blow
he received from the visual jutsu!

596
00:46:50,688 --> 00:46:52,606
<i>This boy also experienced that jutsu...</i>

597
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:57,151
Hey Pervy Sage!
Is Sasuke going to be all right?

598
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:02,653
Seems like he's received
a significant amount of mental damage.

599
00:47:05,191 --> 00:47:09,236
Darn...Why?!

600
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:13,247
What did that guy do to Sasuke?!

601
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:15,013
Hey, Pervy Sage!

602
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,001
We've gotta change our plan!

603
00:47:18,791 --> 00:47:20,376
I got scared earlier,

604
00:47:20,788 --> 00:47:25,835
but this time I'm going to chase
those black capes and get them!

605
00:47:26,067 --> 00:47:28,235
It's me that they want, right?!

606
00:47:29,773 --> 00:47:32,401
Then, I'll be the one to
make my way over!

607
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:37,855
Humph, you're only going to be killed
if you go now.

608
00:47:39,309 --> 00:47:41,109
They're at a totally different level
from you.

609
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:46,947
I just managed to get you
away from them...

610
00:47:47,951 --> 00:47:51,621
Then, are we just going
to keep running away?!

611
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:55,540
Are we supposed to keep living in fear?!

612
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:56,915
Shut your mouth for a second!

613
00:48:00,712 --> 00:48:02,213
You are weak.

614
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,218
I'm sorry, Guy.

615
00:48:08,658 --> 00:48:11,160
I thought that I had spared
the boy's feeling, but...

616
00:48:11,842 --> 00:48:14,886
I should have saved him much sooner.

617
00:48:15,489 --> 00:48:19,326
Kakashi has also come down
with the same jutsu...

618
00:48:20,237 --> 00:48:22,117
We don't know when
he will regain consciousness.

619
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,809
Kakashi Sensei?!

620
00:48:34,404 --> 00:48:36,657
When my students are hurt...

621
00:48:37,709 --> 00:48:40,336
I always wish,
from the bottom of my heart...

622
00:48:41,317 --> 00:48:46,447
If that person,
who is a medical specialist, were here...

623
00:48:47,607 --> 00:48:51,570
That's why we're going to
go find her now.

624
00:48:52,052 --> 00:48:53,052
What?

625
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:54,514
You mean, her?

626
00:49:06,327 --> 00:49:07,412
Could it be...?

627
00:49:18,526 --> 00:49:20,862
W-Wait...!

628
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,752
C-Could this money be...?!

629
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:26,463
Yup, that's right...

630
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:29,675
The one who uses the slug
and drives illness away,

631
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:32,260
and who is also
one of the Sannin like me...

632
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:38,016
All right! We're going to turn around
our luck with this!

633
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:43,230
Princess Tsunade with
the letter Gamble on her back!

634
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:50,153
Well then, Guy.
I'll leave Sasuke to you.

635
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:56,743
Master Jiraiya...

636
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:57,952
Hmm?

637
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:01,519
Be sure to find Mistress Tsunade
and bring her back to...

638
00:50:01,544 --> 00:50:05,298
You bet we'll find her
and bring her right away!

639
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:15,595
Naruto! I like kids with guts like you!
I'm going to give this to you!

640
00:50:17,066 --> 00:50:18,859
This made Lee stronger...

641
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,851
Huh?! What?! What?!

642
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:29,692
This is it!

643
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:39,911
Wow!

644
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,039
They're breathable and
moisture wicking,

645
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:46,460
and perfectly designed for free movement,
all in a beautiful, stylish package.

646
00:50:46,788 --> 00:50:49,874
You'll notice a difference immediately
if you train with them on!

647
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,049
They're going to grow on you!

648
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:55,552
Before long, you'll be wanting to
wear them all the time like Lee!

649
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:57,929
Of course, I have a thing for them, too!

650
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:02,851
Woooow!

651
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:11,151
<i>Why couldn't you bring a mirror
or something</i>

652
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:14,237
<i>instead of carrying around
those things, you dork!</i>

653
00:51:22,351 --> 00:51:23,831
Do you think they'll look good on me?

654
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:27,250
Don't even think about it.
Get a load of that...

655
00:51:35,999 --> 00:51:38,459
<i>Your target is Naruto, after all.</i>

656
00:51:38,945 --> 00:51:45,744
<i>To abduct Naruto is the No. 1 priority
placed by our organization, Akatsuki!</i>

657
00:51:52,467 --> 00:51:53,467
What's wrong?

658
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:59,074
Pervy Sage...Why are they after me?

659
00:52:02,617 --> 00:52:05,871
You know, don't you, Pervert Sage?
Tell me why...

660
00:52:10,701 --> 00:52:16,540
They're not really after you...
They're after what's inside of you.

661
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:20,137
What on earth is this thing?

662
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:26,017
It's a horrible demon that
attacked Leaf Village, right?

663
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:28,395
And was dreaded by all.

664
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:31,731
So why do they want it so much?

665
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,795
Indeed, the Nine-Tailed Fox
is a demon

666
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,156
that appears at each critical juncture
throughout the ages

667
00:52:39,533 --> 00:52:42,828
destroying everything in its path...

668
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:48,123
And people feared it like
an act of nature.

669
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:58,091
The reason they want that thing...
for what purpose.

670
00:52:58,656 --> 00:53:02,159
Honestly, I can't quite say.

671
00:53:04,238 --> 00:53:08,200
Just that now that Nine-Tailed Fox
is sealed up inside of you...

672
00:53:08,774 --> 00:53:14,405
they might be thinking
they want that power in their control.

673
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:18,987
It must be harsh to know

674
00:53:19,012 --> 00:53:21,348
that ninja like them
would keep coming after you...

675
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:22,699
But well, that's your destiny!

676
00:53:23,094 --> 00:53:26,014
Now don't you worry,
I'm going to protect

677
00:53:26,043 --> 00:53:29,547
Then there's nothing to do
but hurry up and get stronger! I've got to

678
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:35,921
Okay! Let's go find that Tsunade person,

679
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:39,299
have her save Sasuke
and get down to some serious training!

680
00:53:41,626 --> 00:53:43,503
<i>That's just like this kid...</i>

681
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:52,812
Th-This place has the highest antes...!

682
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:55,124
Don't go fretting over
every little thing!

683
00:53:55,268 --> 00:53:56,353
Let's go!

684
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:59,694
Oh dear! Please wait!

685
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:04,782
Hmm?

686
00:54:05,725 --> 00:54:06,892
What?

687
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:11,206
The beautiful woman you
want to "research" on...

688
00:54:11,473 --> 00:54:13,475
That's this Tsunade person?

689
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:18,338
Whoa! That's sharp coming from you!
And what about it?

690
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:23,969
She's part of the Sannin thing
like you, right, Pervy Sage?

691
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:26,179
Yes, and what of it?

692
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:29,099
How...old is she?

693
00:54:29,275 --> 00:54:30,443
My age.

694
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:32,811
<i>Heck, she's an old lady.</i>

695
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:39,985
Yikes!

696
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:42,487
Huh?

697
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:44,197
<i>Th-This woman is...!</i>

698
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:56,668
Would you mind changing all
of this money into chips for me?

699
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:02,007
Oh no! She's really going for it!

700
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:10,307
Just who is this? This lady...

701
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:12,225
You don't know?

702
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:15,312
She's that woman with
the famous alias...

703
00:55:15,497 --> 00:55:16,498
Famous alias?

704
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:22,402
So, well...what kind of person
is this Tsunade like?

705
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:24,696
Oh, you want to know?

706
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:25,738
Yeah.

707
00:55:26,005 --> 00:55:27,048
Let's see...

708
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:30,368
Put simply, she's an unpleasant type.

709
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:35,623
Besides that, she's a diehard gambler
and her face is known far and wide for it.

710
00:55:35,808 --> 00:55:37,851
Then we should have no problems
finding her!

711
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,544
If she's that famous!

712
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:44,632
She's famous, all right...
Legendary, you might say...

713
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:52,390
Boss, what's this alias?

714
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:54,100
The Legendary...

715
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:55,977
Legendary?

716
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:13,787
<i>Oh dear! They're all laughing!</i>

717
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,462
- Legendary...
- Legendary...

718
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:25,673
Sitting Duck!

719
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:31,513
Yup! But no matter how famous
Legendary Sitting Duck is,

720
00:56:31,538 --> 00:56:33,999
I doubt we'll find her right away.

721
00:56:34,398 --> 00:56:35,983
Why not?!

722
00:56:36,055 --> 00:56:38,099
She hates growing old so much

723
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:41,523
she's probably used some special jutsu
to change her appearance.

724
00:56:42,809 --> 00:56:44,793
She's actually 50 years old,

725
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:47,195
but no doubt she looks like
she did when she was 20...

726
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:51,991
And not just that,
recently I heard that...

727
00:56:52,178 --> 00:56:56,971
she transforms into her teens or
30s or 40s as the situation calls for

728
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:59,499
to escape moneylenders.

729
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:03,336
What?! That's a horrible thing to do!

730
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:07,799
Tsunade has always loved
to gamble more than anything

731
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:11,219
But she has terrible luck and no skill.

732
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:15,974
She was always being played
for the Sitting Duck and the name stuck...

733
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:19,310
Then she was always borrowing money
and skipping out on her debts, too...

734
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,148
Ah, it brings back memories.

735
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:25,483
This is no time to be
getting all nostalgic!

736
00:57:25,924 --> 00:57:28,594
Tell me, how do you propose
we go about finding her?!

737
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:30,363
Well...

738
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:32,299
We may very well have to
put our noses to the ground,

739
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:34,284
but we're not without our little tricks.

740
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:39,539
What?! So you have no idea
how long it's gong to take?!

741
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:41,708
We won't be wasting any time.

742
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:46,546
All of our time on the road
will be your time.

743
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:48,756
My time?

744
00:57:49,274 --> 00:57:52,736
Time to make you strong...
Training!

745
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,146
Okay!

746
00:58:03,823 --> 00:58:07,653
No, no...I told you that is definitely ou

747
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:12,572
I won't be seen walking with someone
dressed like that.

748
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:22,415
Come on, Pervy Sage!
Let's hurry up and start training!

749
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:24,834
Now now, don't get ahead of yourself...

750
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:27,629
The training won't mean anything

751
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:30,715
unless it's done in the process of
gathering information on Tsunade.

752
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,800
Huh? Gathering information?

753
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:37,889
In this town.

754
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,266
Wow!

755
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:57,617
Cool! This is my first time
for this kind of thing!

756
00:58:57,867 --> 00:58:59,619
Down time is important, too!

757
00:58:59,644 --> 00:59:01,804
You go have yourself some fun
before we start training.

758
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:04,207
The festival should continue
for some time.

759
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:06,543
We'll stay here in this city
for the duration.

760
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,753
We'll train here, too!

761
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:10,380
All right!

762
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:22,684
Whoa! That's a fat wallet!
You're rich!

763
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:24,978
I have quite a bit!

764
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:27,272
I've saved it little by little
throughout my missions.

765
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:28,982
Well then!

766
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:30,733
- Wait! Naruto!
- Huh?

767
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:33,194
I'll hold on to your wallet for you!

768
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:35,405
Wh-What do you think you're doing?!

769
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:38,241
You can spend this much...

770
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:41,327
What?! Only 300 ryo!

771
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:42,870
No complaints!

772
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:47,166
Remember, shinobi must honor
the "Shinobi's Three Taboos"!

773
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:50,670
Shinobi's Three Taboos...?
What's that?

774
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,714
What?! You don't know!

775
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:54,650
The "three taboos" are
the three temptations

776
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:57,343
that will bring shinobi to ruin!

777
00:59:57,616 --> 01:00:02,246
The three temptations are
booze, women and money...

778
01:00:02,442 --> 01:00:06,154
Oh, then this doesn't really apply
to me all that much!

779
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:11,941
I'm minor, so I can't drink yet!
I don't quite get the women thing!

780
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:13,943
And I worked so hard
to save all that money,

781
01:00:13,968 --> 01:00:15,636
I don't really feel much like using it...

782
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:19,198
You fool! Don't you underestimate
the desire for money!

783
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,117
Once you start using it,
it goes really fast!

784
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:25,079
Money has a frightful power.

785
01:00:25,639 --> 01:00:27,432
This Tsunade we are going
to be looking for

786
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:29,917
has ruined herself over it!

787
01:00:31,429 --> 01:00:34,641
Your desire for women is always
getting the better of you, too, Pervy Sage

788
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:37,425
I'm going on
an information gathering mission!

789
01:00:37,785 --> 01:00:40,663
Here, you hold on to my bag for me!

790
01:00:41,113 --> 01:00:42,051
If you get lost,

791
01:00:42,076 --> 01:00:45,663
my tracking Toad
will follow my scent!

792
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:54,108
<i>He's really just a child after all,
contrary to appearances...</i>

793
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:56,319
Last one!

794
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:00,531
- All right! Perfect!
- Oh! Amazing!

795
01:01:02,737 --> 01:01:05,364
<i>That's the fruit of hard training
throwing shuriken.</i>

796
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:15,213
You stink, sonny!

797
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:18,007
Hah! Gosh darn it!
Well, just watch this!

798
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:19,926
Hold it!

799
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:20,967
Huh?

800
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:27,100
<i>Attention: Shinobi!
Ninjutsu strictly forbidden!</i>

801
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:31,978
Thanks now!

802
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:38,486
You shouldn't try to walk around
with the mask on.

803
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:49,706
It's Pervy Sage's bank saving book.

804
01:01:50,748 --> 01:01:53,876
One, ten, one hundred...

805
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:58,297
<i>L-Look at all those zeros!</i>

806
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:02,802
He should be treating me now and then
if he has this much money.

807
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:04,721
Stingy old geezer!

808
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:13,062
There's only a little left...
One more stand and that will be it...

809
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:19,402
<i>Time to make you strong...
Training!</i>

810
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:29,245
Two grilled squids please, sir!
Make one of those an adult size!

811
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:32,248
Okay! Someone sent you
to buy some squid, eh?!

812
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:34,751
I'll throw in a child size for free!
Coming right up!

813
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,795
Hurray for you, sir!
You're a man among men!

814
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:41,782
Oh, you can tell, eh?! All right!
I'll give you the adult one for half price

815
01:02:41,872 --> 01:02:43,082
Thanks!

816
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:47,305
Good grief, where did he go to?!

817
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,685
<i>Huh? The voice of Pervy Sage?</i>

818
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,483
Young ladies are so nice.

819
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:02,528
Oh, Naruto! You've already had
you're fill of the festival?

820
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:17,043
Repeat those three Shinobi Taboos again!

821
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:20,421
You're breaking all three at once!
You bastard!

822
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:22,467
W-Wait, Naruto...

823
01:03:22,492 --> 01:03:23,874
N-No, I won't wait!

824
01:03:24,008 --> 01:03:27,345
You used all my hard saved money!

825
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:29,514
- Take this and this and this!
- N-Naruto, stop!

826
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:32,266
I'll pay it all back!
I'm sorry, p-please!

827
01:03:32,291 --> 01:03:35,794
You! You!
You made my froggy wallet all flat!

828
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:39,857
Hey! Look what you did, you urchin!

829
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:47,698
You stained Leader's designer suit!
You'll have to pay for it!

830
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:49,575
Fork over 100,000 ryo!

831
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:53,204
What?! You're telling me
that suit cost 100,000 ryo?!

832
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:55,832
Yeah, really, that's quite a stretch

833
01:03:56,029 --> 01:03:58,865
to say a dorky suit like that
cost 100,000 ryo.

834
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:00,711
Are you asking for it?!

835
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:03,115
You better put a lid on it
if you know what's good for you.

836
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:06,050
The leader used be a chunin from
the Hidden Village of Stones,

837
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:10,012
the legendary dark ninja, feared by all!

838
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:13,724
Come again? Legendary what?

839
01:04:14,141 --> 01:04:16,727
You seem to want to get hurt!

840
01:04:17,728 --> 01:04:18,728
Naruto.

841
01:04:19,772 --> 01:04:20,773
Perfect timing.

842
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:25,695
I'll show you a jutsu now...
Watch very carefully!

843
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:27,905
Now you've done it!

844
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:38,332
A-Amazing!

845
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:47,258
I was holding back quite a bit...
You guys are so weak.

846
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:55,433
A-Are you? The...legendary...

847
01:04:56,084 --> 01:04:59,212
I'm sorry...
We kind of destroyed your stand...

848
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:01,981
H-Here...Fix. It with this.

849
01:05:02,189 --> 01:05:04,275
Oh! Thanks.

850
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:09,488
Would you mind if I bought all
your balloons and water balloons

851
01:05:09,811 --> 01:05:11,146
at the same time, my man?

852
01:05:11,198 --> 01:05:12,450
Fine by me...

853
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:17,955
<i>That wasn't an ordinary hand move...</i>

854
01:05:18,364 --> 01:05:21,033
<i>What in blazes was that jutsu?</i>

855
01:05:21,653 --> 01:05:22,653
Naruto!

856
01:05:23,303 --> 01:05:25,639
Come with me! It's training time!

857
01:05:26,964 --> 01:05:27,964
Yes, sir!

858
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:39,310
Finally, the mood is right
for a little training.

859
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:41,479
- Here! Water balloon!
- Wha?

860
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:44,190
Eh?! What is it for?!

861
01:05:44,816 --> 01:05:47,819
You saw that jutsu I just used, right?

862
01:05:47,985 --> 01:05:49,320
Y-Yeah.

863
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:50,887
What jutsu did it look like to you?

864
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:55,952
It looked like you made
your opponent spin violently.

865
01:05:56,762 --> 01:05:59,390
<i>His perspective's off...
But I guess that's to be expected.</i>

866
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:02,500
Right, okay...Yes, spinning

867
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:07,546
<i>He's spinning the water in the balloon
without moving his hand?!</i>

868
01:06:10,883 --> 01:06:11,883
Whoa!

869
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:13,719
The tree climbing exercise

870
01:06:13,744 --> 01:06:16,455
to learn to gather and
maintain chakra in necessary places...

871
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:18,849
The Walk on Water exercise

872
01:06:18,874 --> 01:06:20,918
to learn how to release
a set amount of chakra...

873
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:23,688
You did both of these, right?

874
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:27,358
And now with this water balloon exercise,

875
01:06:27,441 --> 01:06:29,321
you'll learn how to create
a stream of chakra...

876
01:06:29,973 --> 01:06:31,475
In other words, spinning.

877
01:06:32,469 --> 01:06:34,721
Create a stream of chakra...

878
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:37,503
I'll give a more detailed explanation
of the jutsu

879
01:06:37,528 --> 01:06:40,031
once you get these first steps down.

880
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:43,040
First, you must gather
and maintain chakra in your hand

881
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:44,442
using the tree climbing technique.

882
01:06:45,086 --> 01:06:46,647
Then you must continuously
release chakra

883
01:06:46,752 --> 01:06:48,629
using the Walk on Water technique.

884
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:54,487
Then you push and churn the water
in the balloon with the chakra!

885
01:06:55,219 --> 01:06:56,595
I get it!

886
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:59,306
Then you spin the water
in the balloon faster and faster

887
01:06:59,331 --> 01:07:01,625
until the balloon pops!

888
01:07:02,393 --> 01:07:05,312
You're catching on
more and more quickly!

889
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:08,190
Okay, today we're going
to train until evening

890
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:09,315
Yes, sir!

891
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:21,287
Now, what will happen?

892
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,801
It's something to be concerned about...

893
01:07:24,066 --> 01:07:25,359
Mister!

894
01:07:25,916 --> 01:07:27,460
Why don't you stop by?

895
01:07:27,749 --> 01:07:29,876
This month is our special service month.

896
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:32,798
Whoa! It's a special service month?

897
01:07:32,842 --> 01:07:34,594
The more you visit,
the more you benefit.

898
01:07:35,314 --> 01:07:36,940
Here you go, a stamp card!

899
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:39,063
I'll give you lots and lots of service!

900
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:42,683
I'll come, I'll come!

901
01:08:00,424 --> 01:08:02,092
Hey! Come on down, Shu!

902
01:08:03,954 --> 01:08:06,500
Hey, hey, where is the toilet?

903
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:14,715
All right now!

904
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:18,135
Training, once again today!
I'm gonna work hard like a blaze!

905
01:08:23,808 --> 01:08:26,227
Break! Break! Break!

906
01:08:29,563 --> 01:08:31,690
Why won't it break?

907
01:08:40,991 --> 01:08:42,660
Little Jiraiya, you're so naughty!

908
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,164
Men are all naughty!

909
01:08:55,256 --> 01:08:56,590
Dang it!

910
01:08:59,009 --> 01:09:02,930
<i>Three days have passed since
I got the tip from that Pervy Sage...</i>

911
01:09:03,764 --> 01:09:06,976
<i>The rubber is stretched this much,
but why won't it break?</i>

912
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:10,563
<i>What am I doing different from
that Pervy Sage?</i>

913
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:17,778
This is great! This is so great!

914
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:31,958
What the?

915
01:09:37,798 --> 01:09:40,968
Whoa, he stinks of alcohol.

916
01:09:43,637 --> 01:09:45,222
I'm gonna eat now!

917
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:48,516
Huh?

918
01:09:51,812 --> 01:09:52,813
What's the matter?

919
01:09:57,318 --> 01:09:59,778
Oh dang it!

920
01:10:00,368 --> 01:10:02,828
<i>Darn it! Why is it like this?!</i>

921
01:10:13,036 --> 01:10:17,958
<i>No need to learn a finicky hand sign!
It's okay to be stupid!</i>

922
01:10:19,192 --> 01:10:23,321
<i>He said that there's no need to form
a hand signal, but...</i>

923
01:10:37,413 --> 01:10:40,708
Hey! That's not your toy...

924
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:53,374
This is it!

925
01:10:58,045 --> 01:11:02,258
Hurry up and wake up!
Hey, you Pervy Sage!

926
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:05,886
Uh...G-Good timing.

927
01:11:06,110 --> 01:11:08,362
Why don't you bring me some water...

928
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:09,514
Water?

929
01:11:17,314 --> 01:11:20,150
The first step is cleared!

930
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:23,654
Cleared...?

931
01:11:24,262 --> 01:11:26,723
Well, let's have you show it to me.

932
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:30,494
All right! Watch it carefully!

933
01:11:33,872 --> 01:11:34,957
<i>Left hand?</i>

934
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:48,929
Go!

935
01:11:53,524 --> 01:11:56,694
All right! See that?! See that?!

936
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:01,317
You're sleeping!

937
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:05,112
Sorry, sorry.

938
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:08,657
I'm tired from the days and nights
of gathering information.

939
01:12:09,104 --> 01:12:11,523
<i>But that seems suspicious to begin with!</i>

940
01:12:11,858 --> 01:12:13,318
<i>You still stink of alcohol too!</i>

941
01:12:16,373 --> 01:12:17,373
<i>Nevertheless...</i>

942
01:12:17,811 --> 01:12:20,894
<i>You rotate the water inside the water ball
that you hold in your left hand</i>

943
01:12:20,919 --> 01:12:24,173
<i>by repeatedly applying it
with your right hand...</i>

944
01:12:25,090 --> 01:12:26,842
<i>It seems little strange of an idea, but...</i>

945
01:12:26,925 --> 01:12:28,802
<i>You're an interesting kid.</i>

946
01:12:30,837 --> 01:12:36,885
You understood the trick pretty well.
It's all thanks to me, though.

947
01:12:38,812 --> 01:12:41,273
It's thanks to this guy!

948
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:43,775
Huh?

949
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:48,280
I realized after I saw this cat playing
with the water balloon.

950
01:12:50,006 --> 01:12:52,509
He kept on flicking it with
his paw many times

951
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:55,340
and the water inside shocked
in all different kinds of direction...

952
01:12:55,365 --> 01:12:57,284
Then it came to me like "bingo!"

953
01:12:58,415 --> 01:13:00,459
How did it come like bingo?

954
01:13:01,013 --> 01:13:04,141
The time when the Pervy Sage
first showed me breaking it...

955
01:13:04,608 --> 01:13:08,153
I remembered how the water balloon
surface was not smooth.

956
01:13:08,967 --> 01:13:11,737
Until then,
I was always only rotating the water

957
01:13:11,762 --> 01:13:13,639
in the one same direction...

958
01:13:14,431 --> 01:13:17,309
I realized that the Pervy Sage's
water balloon was not smooth

959
01:13:17,547 --> 01:13:21,760
because the water inside was rotating
in different directions.

960
01:13:22,693 --> 01:13:26,572
And after doing it in my own way,
it broke!

961
01:13:27,502 --> 01:13:29,671
<i>It seems it's still not possible for you</i>

962
01:13:29,696 --> 01:13:32,366
<i>to rotate it violently with one hand, but.</i>

963
01:13:32,758 --> 01:13:35,887
<i>I suppose you thought it out
in your own way.</i>

964
01:13:36,995 --> 01:13:38,831
That's just what he expected of me!

965
01:13:39,514 --> 01:13:43,223
Anyhow...
The first step is complete for now.

966
01:13:43,248 --> 01:13:44,917
All right!

967
01:13:45,103 --> 01:13:47,773
Do you want to see it one more time?
One more time!

968
01:13:47,798 --> 01:13:48,798
Oww!

969
01:13:50,108 --> 01:13:52,778
<i>You used too much chakra and
it gradually reached the point</i>

970
01:13:52,803 --> 01:13:54,680
<i>where there's burden
on the chakra network...</i>

971
01:13:55,443 --> 01:13:58,029
<i>But the next one won't be like this!</i>

972
01:14:01,669 --> 01:14:05,215
Okay. Now, we will proceed
to the second step.

973
01:14:05,374 --> 01:14:06,333
Yeah!

974
01:14:06,358 --> 01:14:09,611
It seems like we can finally go
into some serious training!

975
01:14:09,827 --> 01:14:11,161
- Here you go
- Huh?

976
01:14:12,006 --> 01:14:17,011
Rubber ball?
Something like this again?!

977
01:14:17,683 --> 01:14:19,518
Now, you'll break this one!

978
01:14:23,773 --> 01:14:26,317
It's one hundred times harder
than the water balloon!

979
01:14:38,098 --> 01:14:39,098
<i>It's hard...</i>

980
01:14:40,017 --> 01:14:43,896
The first step is rotation,
the second step is force.

981
01:14:44,746 --> 01:14:46,290
Since there is no water inside,

982
01:14:46,515 --> 01:14:49,107
it's more difficult to imagine
the rotation of chakra,

983
01:14:49,132 --> 01:14:51,422
so it becomes more difficult
to rotate the chakra as well.

984
01:14:52,064 --> 01:14:53,107
That's true...

985
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:55,407
I'll leave that to your own judgment.

986
01:14:56,533 --> 01:14:58,695
<i>I need to learn a trick again
to do this, don't I?</i>

987
01:14:59,637 --> 01:15:03,891
Well then,
I'll go gather some information.

988
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:05,542
Hey! Wait, wait!

989
01:15:05,792 --> 01:15:08,086
Let's train together for
the first time in a while!

990
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:09,922
I don't mind if you take a nap.

991
01:15:10,169 --> 01:15:11,546
Don't depend on me!

992
01:15:12,549 --> 01:15:15,260
You must have some kind
of misunderstanding!

993
01:15:16,829 --> 01:15:19,040
I did say that I'll teach you the jutsu,

994
01:15:19,264 --> 01:15:21,904
but I don't have the obligation
to teach you every step of the way.

995
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:23,810
If you can't do it by yourself,
then that's it.

996
01:15:25,003 --> 01:15:29,340
Don't be childish forever...
Become more respectable like a shinobi!

997
01:15:29,625 --> 01:15:31,752
Well, well then.

998
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:36,227
If you can at least teach me...
the trick again...

999
01:15:37,741 --> 01:15:38,450
Money!

1000
01:15:38,773 --> 01:15:41,610
<i>Money...money...money...</i>

1001
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:46,291
W What do you mean
"be respectable like a shinobi"?!

1002
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:49,002
Even though you say that,
you're an dirty and greedy adult!

1003
01:15:49,127 --> 01:15:51,647
You're not a respectable shinobi at all!

1004
01:16:05,615 --> 01:16:09,619
<i>It's way more difficult than
the time with the water balloon...</i>

1005
01:16:11,858 --> 01:16:13,694
<i>A-And...</i>

1006
01:16:16,321 --> 01:16:18,490
<i>My hands and arms hurt.</i>

1007
01:16:46,351 --> 01:16:50,147
Dang it! How many days am I
going to be doing the same thing!

1008
01:16:58,366 --> 01:17:01,119
<i>Second from the top in
the difficulty of mastering...</i>

1009
01:17:02,826 --> 01:17:04,036
<i>Don't depend on me!</i>

1010
01:17:04,202 --> 01:17:06,705
<i>You must have some kind
of misunderstanding!</i>

1011
01:17:07,205 --> 01:17:08,290
Dang it!

1012
01:17:12,095 --> 01:17:13,430
Hey, Naruto.

1013
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:15,756
What did you come here for?

1014
01:17:16,061 --> 01:17:18,397
Go buy some food from the town below.

1015
01:17:18,553 --> 01:17:20,763
What?! Why me?

1016
01:17:20,844 --> 01:17:21,887
Hey you...

1017
01:17:22,027 --> 01:17:25,197
Even if for a while, you're still
learning the jutsu from me.

1018
01:17:29,936 --> 01:17:31,647
Here you go, thanks for waiting

1019
01:17:31,941 --> 01:17:33,317
Thank you.

1020
01:17:35,975 --> 01:17:38,295
<i>How dare he put on a master's face
only at a time like this</i>

1021
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,781
<i>when he doesn't teach me anything...</i>

1022
01:17:41,539 --> 01:17:43,583
Dad, buy me some ice cream.

1023
01:17:44,315 --> 01:17:46,550
I want this one that cracks.

1024
01:17:51,249 --> 01:17:51,917
Here.

1025
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:55,462
Why? I can eat all of it by myself.

1026
01:17:56,088 --> 01:18:00,717
Nope, when you get home,
your mother will have supper ready.

1027
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:02,080
Okay!

1028
01:18:07,599 --> 01:18:09,267
Hey...you know...

1029
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:10,351
Huh?

1030
01:18:10,435 --> 01:18:15,107
Can you be around my training
for just a while...today?

1031
01:18:15,482 --> 01:18:17,484
I don't have time for that.

1032
01:18:17,901 --> 01:18:20,487
I have to immediately go to town.

1033
01:18:22,906 --> 01:18:26,368
Unless you think for yourself and
get a grip of the trick for yourself,

1034
01:18:26,551 --> 01:18:29,262
it'll never work.

1035
01:18:30,622 --> 01:18:32,833
I thought I told you three weeks ago!

1036
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:37,713
Don't be spoiled like a kid.
You are a ninja.

1037
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:47,139
I know that without
your telling me!

1038
01:18:47,639 --> 01:18:49,975
Just thought I'd ask.

1039
01:18:50,308 --> 01:18:52,894
Hurry up and go,
you Pervy Sage!

1040
01:18:53,246 --> 01:18:56,249
Oh no, little Jiraiya,
you tell so many lies!

1041
01:18:56,361 --> 01:18:59,653
What do you mean?!
Everything is true!

1042
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:29,639
Dang it! It doesn't break
no matter how much I try...

1043
01:19:30,682 --> 01:19:34,352
<i>I'm just wasting away
my chakra doing this.</i>

1044
01:19:36,563 --> 01:19:37,563
<i>Also...</i>

1045
01:19:38,590 --> 01:19:42,302
<i>The more I increase the amount of flow,
the worse the pain gets.</i>

1046
01:19:43,516 --> 01:19:45,727
<i>But...How do I say it?</i>

1047
01:19:45,908 --> 01:19:48,536
<i>If I don't go all out as if
to explode the chakra,</i>

1048
01:19:48,561 --> 01:19:50,146
<i>it's not going to break!</i>

1049
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:57,208
<i>That's it!</i>

1050
01:19:58,001 --> 01:20:00,521
<i>If I understand the amount of chakra
that flows from the pain I feel...</i>

1051
01:20:00,545 --> 01:20:04,633
<i>Then I can bear the pain to the limit
and all at once...</i>

1052
01:20:06,718 --> 01:20:08,553
<i>No, not yet...</i>

1053
01:20:10,249 --> 01:20:11,249
<i>Not yet!</i>

1054
01:20:15,194 --> 01:20:17,113
<i>Not yet...store it!</i>

1055
01:20:21,144 --> 01:20:22,144
<i>Now!</i>

1056
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,321
Oww!

1057
01:20:36,289 --> 01:20:39,417
Hmm...There seems to have been
a little progress.

1058
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:41,253
Humph!

1059
01:20:41,380 --> 01:20:44,300
I've still only opened a hole
and it hasn't popped with a bang!

1060
01:20:44,632 --> 01:20:47,885
Hey, don't pretend to be so tough. Here!

1061
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:52,848
You've done well,
all on your own power.

1062
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:00,521
It's so good!

1063
01:21:01,072 --> 01:21:02,072
Yes...

1064
01:21:04,150 --> 01:21:06,444
Oh yeah. Maybe we'll test a bit.

1065
01:21:07,012 --> 01:21:08,576
What, what?

1066
01:21:09,072 --> 01:21:10,615
Give me your right hand.

1067
01:21:19,624 --> 01:21:20,917
What's this?

1068
01:21:28,975 --> 01:21:29,975
Here.

1069
01:21:31,177 --> 01:21:35,432
It's the same one...
But this is the trick?

1070
01:21:35,932 --> 01:21:38,685
You're the type who was yelled at
at the academy

1071
01:21:38,710 --> 01:21:40,150
for not having concentration, right?

1072
01:21:40,357 --> 01:21:42,526
That doesn't have anything
to do with me now.

1073
01:21:43,648 --> 01:21:45,066
Look at this paper.

1074
01:21:46,276 --> 01:21:47,276
Uh?

1075
01:21:48,028 --> 01:21:49,028
I've seen it.

1076
01:21:49,195 --> 01:21:50,195
Fine, then.

1077
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:52,365
Look at it again.

1078
01:21:56,453 --> 01:21:57,453
Hmm?

1079
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:04,377
So what is this?

1080
01:22:04,961 --> 01:22:08,882
It's not something that
I need to explain in length,

1081
01:22:09,234 --> 01:22:11,468
but when you first looked
at this blank piece of paper,

1082
01:22:11,509 --> 01:22:13,970
you just glanced at
the whole thing, correct?

1083
01:22:14,564 --> 01:22:15,564
Probably.

1084
01:22:15,902 --> 01:22:18,321
Then where do you look on this one?

1085
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:22,896
Most likely the point in the middle?

1086
01:22:24,481 --> 01:22:27,817
When a human being looks at
just a blank piece of paper,

1087
01:22:28,151 --> 01:22:31,488
he doesn't know where to look,
so the eyes wander.

1088
01:22:35,225 --> 01:22:37,894
But if you put even a single point on it,

1089
01:22:38,177 --> 01:22:39,762
the mind focuses there...

1090
01:22:40,664 --> 01:22:45,060
This is concentrating at a single point
and as you focus your mind,

1091
01:22:45,085 --> 01:22:49,903
you become spiritually stable and
you are able to extract unexpected power.

1092
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:51,758
Huh?

1093
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:55,512
When you opened a hole
on the rubber ball,

1094
01:22:55,887 --> 01:22:57,048
you must have been
concentrating desperately

1095
01:22:57,073 --> 01:23:00,618
to fill up the chakra
in the palm of your hand.

1096
01:23:01,017 --> 01:23:02,017
Yeah, yeah.

1097
01:23:02,936 --> 01:23:04,854
When you concentrate,
power emerges.

1098
01:23:05,408 --> 01:23:09,412
But without a target,
it is difficult to concentrate.

1099
01:23:10,202 --> 01:23:11,537
That's why we have this...

1100
01:23:11,922 --> 01:23:14,178
Listen Naruto, from now on,

1101
01:23:14,203 --> 01:23:16,831
when you store up the chakra
you build in your right hand,

1102
01:23:17,010 --> 01:23:20,597
try to store it up by concentrating
on that mark.

1103
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:22,722
Concentrate...

1104
01:23:24,207 --> 01:23:26,960
All right, I'll try it!

1105
01:23:37,805 --> 01:23:38,805
Sasuke...

1106
01:23:44,721 --> 01:23:46,247
My, my arm!

1107
01:23:46,329 --> 01:23:47,997
Are you okay, Lord Orochimaru?

1108
01:23:48,545 --> 01:23:49,905
Please take this medicine quickly.

1109
01:24:09,627 --> 01:24:10,754
Oh, my...

1110
01:24:11,171 --> 01:24:13,840
Just as I get back,
I have to clean the room.

1111
01:24:14,841 --> 01:24:16,926
Please make sure you to take
your medicine.

1112
01:24:17,927 --> 01:24:20,805
I don't need that kind
of lip service.

1113
01:24:21,639 --> 01:24:24,100
It's medicine that I prescribed.

1114
01:24:24,495 --> 01:24:27,103
The pain should subside
at least slightly.

1115
01:24:27,528 --> 01:24:29,947
The pain on this arm
that seems to burn...

1116
01:24:30,482 --> 01:24:33,735
I never thought that it cause
this much suffering.

1117
01:24:34,023 --> 01:24:39,654
Sarutobi...known as Third Hokage.
It's his last curse, after all.

1118
01:24:39,949 --> 01:24:41,117
Enough of the talking...

1119
01:24:41,671 --> 01:24:43,756
More importantly,
has that individual been found?

1120
01:24:44,329 --> 01:24:48,041
Yes...She seems to be at a place
called Tanzaku Town.

1121
01:24:49,950 --> 01:24:51,326
Tanzaku Town...

1122
01:24:55,254 --> 01:24:56,421
Is that so...?

1123
01:24:57,096 --> 01:25:00,933
But the opponent is one of the Sannin,
the Legendary Three Ninjas.

1124
01:25:01,971 --> 01:25:03,640
It won't be that simple.

1125
01:25:07,273 --> 01:25:10,359
Good medicine tends to taste bitter.

1126
01:25:14,185 --> 01:25:16,479
Concentrate!

1127
01:25:29,624 --> 01:25:33,878
Darn it. It's not supposed to be like this

1128
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:35,547
It has to break like "pang."

1129
01:25:41,785 --> 01:25:43,108
Concentrate!

1130
01:26:00,864 --> 01:26:03,575
Hello...I'd like to make a little inquiry

1131
01:26:26,055 --> 01:26:27,055
Dang it.

1132
01:26:34,575 --> 01:26:35,993
Concentrate.

1133
01:27:00,512 --> 01:27:02,514
Concentrate!

1134
01:27:10,099 --> 01:27:11,142
No good.

1135
01:27:22,739 --> 01:27:27,505
Dang it. What does it mean
to concentrate?!

1136
01:27:43,591 --> 01:27:46,594
Damn you, Sarutobi!

1137
01:28:10,243 --> 01:28:11,077
All right then...

1138
01:28:11,261 --> 01:28:13,972
I'm going again to gather
some information.

1139
01:28:13,997 --> 01:28:16,457
What...? But you just came.

1140
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:19,043
I don't have any time to waste.

1141
01:28:21,254 --> 01:28:22,379
Hey, hey...!

1142
01:28:22,497 --> 01:28:24,875
Isn't there going to be even
a little soulful game of catch

1143
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:26,485
between the master and pupil?

1144
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:30,430
You scoundrel.

1145
01:28:35,515 --> 01:28:36,766
Strike!

1146
01:28:38,062 --> 01:28:39,814
Here, the game of catch is over.

1147
01:28:42,275 --> 01:28:43,818
See you later.

1148
01:28:47,739 --> 01:28:52,744
Humph...I'll forget about that Pervy Sage
and work hard by myself.

1149
01:28:55,863 --> 01:28:59,283
<i>That's the only way, Naruto...</i>

1150
01:28:59,643 --> 01:29:01,061
<i>You have to do this training alone.</i>

1151
01:29:01,998 --> 01:29:04,398
<i>You have the ability to approach
the Fourth Hokage's level...</i>

1152
01:29:04,455 --> 01:29:05,915
<i>Grasp it by yourself!</i>

1153
01:29:09,979 --> 01:29:13,607
Hmm...Never seen her.

1154
01:29:13,976 --> 01:29:15,143
If that's the case...

1155
01:29:15,735 --> 01:29:17,153
Sorry to bother you.

1156
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:19,570
I know the person.

1157
01:29:22,422 --> 01:29:24,799
As well as where she is right now.

1158
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:26,778
I'll buy you a drink.

1159
01:29:28,112 --> 01:29:32,283
There's no need.
I was able to win a tidy sum...

1160
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:33,826
Thanks to that lady.

1161
01:29:34,243 --> 01:29:36,954
<i>Yeah...you are indeed
the Legendary Sitting Duck.</i>

1162
01:29:37,955 --> 01:29:40,708
She lost again, huh.

1163
01:29:41,607 --> 01:29:43,734
Her losses started to pile up...

1164
01:29:43,878 --> 01:29:45,718
So she was talking about
changing her location.

1165
01:29:46,297 --> 01:29:47,297
Where to?

1166
01:29:53,554 --> 01:29:56,182
Seven, seven, seven...

1167
01:29:58,226 --> 01:30:00,395
Seven, seven, seven...

1168
01:30:02,647 --> 01:30:05,650
Seven, seven, seven...

1169
01:30:07,318 --> 01:30:08,361
Here it comes!

1170
01:30:10,321 --> 01:30:12,240
Congratulations to the customer!

1171
01:30:12,265 --> 01:30:14,851
Fever has started
on machine number 44.

1172
01:30:15,416 --> 01:30:18,127
Now, please keep on getting it out
like a flood.

1173
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:21,749
Lady Tsunade, a rare thing does happen
once in while.

1174
01:30:23,209 --> 01:30:25,044
<i>A 37 for me?</i>

1175
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:30,252
<i>I have a bad premonition.</i>

1176
01:30:32,176 --> 01:30:35,680
I also have some knowledge
regarding Lady Tsunade...

1177
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:38,474
I did use to be part of
the Medical Corps, after all.

1178
01:30:40,089 --> 01:30:43,634
She was the first person to propose
what is now an accepted practice

1179
01:30:43,834 --> 01:30:48,755
of assigning one medical specialist
to a small squad of four.

1180
01:30:49,902 --> 01:30:51,904
This was a very revolutionary idea...

1181
01:30:52,476 --> 01:30:55,854
A small combat unit that doesn't
even have emergency medical skills,

1182
01:30:55,941 --> 01:31:00,112
what would happen to them in a battlefield
is clearer than seeing fire.

1183
01:31:03,251 --> 01:31:05,503
Countless experiences in war

1184
01:31:05,918 --> 01:31:09,464
simply became knowledge
to equip themselves with.

1185
01:31:09,975 --> 01:31:14,230
Many who were sacrificed
led to the creation of that style.

1186
01:31:15,011 --> 01:31:17,636
A person understands the nature
of things for the first time

1187
01:31:17,661 --> 01:31:20,372
after losing them.

1188
01:31:20,933 --> 01:31:26,105
And the thing created by
one of the legendary Sannin,

1189
01:31:26,982 --> 01:31:29,443
who is known as the medical specialist

1190
01:31:30,943 --> 01:31:32,945
is that sacrifice.

1191
01:32:11,243 --> 01:32:12,411
Hey!

1192
01:32:12,818 --> 01:32:14,445
You guys, we're in class right now.

1193
01:32:16,197 --> 01:32:18,491
You...fools!

1194
01:32:23,234 --> 01:32:27,572
You guys have no concentration at all...!

1195
01:32:27,899 --> 01:32:31,236
This is not the way to
become fine ninja.

1196
01:32:31,466 --> 01:32:36,095
How can we stay still at a table,
right, Akamaru?

1197
01:32:37,738 --> 01:32:40,032
I'm hungry.

1198
01:32:40,139 --> 01:32:42,683
Sensei, if it's a scolding,
do it quickly.

1199
01:32:44,392 --> 01:32:47,013
What the?! You, you guys...

1200
01:32:47,478 --> 01:32:49,438
From now, we will have
an after school lesson

1201
01:32:49,463 --> 01:32:51,632
to teach you guys more concentration!

1202
01:32:51,961 --> 01:32:53,504
- What?!
- What?!

1203
01:32:58,656 --> 01:32:59,699
What's this?

1204
01:33:00,592 --> 01:33:02,618
You guys are going to do from now

1205
01:33:02,643 --> 01:33:04,436
what the predecessors of
the Leaf Village

1206
01:33:04,766 --> 01:33:07,018
used to perform every day
as a concentration method!

1207
01:33:08,237 --> 01:33:09,950
It is training to build up chakra

1208
01:33:09,975 --> 01:33:14,063
by concentrating your entire energy
on the leaf on your forehead.

1209
01:33:14,561 --> 01:33:16,938
It's an ancient way of learning

1210
01:33:17,028 --> 01:33:18,989
how not to become distracted
from anything else

1211
01:33:19,077 --> 01:33:20,837
by concentrating on a single point,
the leaf.

1212
01:33:22,388 --> 01:33:25,766
The one who hones his concentration
is truly a great ninja...

1213
01:33:26,392 --> 01:33:29,353
This is the origin of the Leaf Symbol
on the headband.

1214
01:33:30,226 --> 01:33:31,477
That sounds like a lie.

1215
01:33:31,526 --> 01:33:35,113
Aren't you making that story up
to force us to try harder?

1216
01:33:35,151 --> 01:33:37,570
I'm not making this up!
It's a true story.

1217
01:33:37,671 --> 01:33:40,131
Anyhow, can you really become
a great ninja

1218
01:33:40,156 --> 01:33:41,789
by just polishing your concentration?

1219
01:33:41,814 --> 01:33:45,234
At any rate,
a great ninja is a guy who's strong.

1220
01:33:45,664 --> 01:33:46,873
Hey, you have a point.

1221
01:33:47,158 --> 01:33:48,243
This stuff...

1222
01:33:50,890 --> 01:33:52,392
Bye, bye Sensei!

1223
01:33:53,002 --> 01:33:55,004
Hey, hey, you guys wait a minute.

1224
01:33:55,029 --> 01:33:57,225
- We won't wait!
- We don't have time for that!

1225
01:33:57,757 --> 01:34:01,093
Hey! You misfits!

1226
01:34:05,812 --> 01:34:07,355
This is the same thing.

1227
01:34:10,018 --> 01:34:14,231
I should have paid more attention
to what Iruka Sensei was saying...

1228
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:16,887
I'm so stupid.

1229
01:34:20,205 --> 01:34:24,042
But nothing will start
if I just keep on regretting.

1230
01:34:28,746 --> 01:34:32,792
All right, I'm going to master this!

1231
01:34:39,507 --> 01:34:41,634
Concentrate, concentrate...

1232
01:34:44,855 --> 01:34:50,027
Wow! Tanzaku Castle sure does have
a commanding presence!

1233
01:34:50,726 --> 01:34:54,522
It's worth being designated
as the cultural heritage.

1234
01:34:54,943 --> 01:34:56,778
Don't dally...

1235
01:34:57,387 --> 01:34:59,107
We're going to hurry up
and leave this town.

1236
01:34:59,652 --> 01:35:02,113
Lady Tsunade, please look more carefully..

1237
01:35:02,138 --> 01:35:04,369
It costs nothing to view.

1238
01:35:08,705 --> 01:35:09,705
Lady Tsunade?

1239
01:35:12,957 --> 01:35:15,126
<i>What is this chill?</i>

1240
01:35:51,251 --> 01:35:52,251
Now!

1241
01:36:29,383 --> 01:36:30,676
<i>What a kid...</i>

1242
01:36:31,378 --> 01:36:34,381
<i>Raising the density in chakra
to the point that it burns the palm.</i>

1243
01:36:35,792 --> 01:36:38,461
<i>He never ceases to amaze me.</i>

1244
01:36:44,344 --> 01:36:45,387
It broke.

1245
01:36:45,908 --> 01:36:48,911
Good! The second step seems
to be complete.

1246
01:36:49,136 --> 01:36:52,306
Hurry...The third step.

1247
01:36:52,681 --> 01:36:54,266
That will come later.

1248
01:36:54,557 --> 01:36:56,476
We'll now go meet Tsunade.

1249
01:37:08,739 --> 01:37:09,739
That's...

1250
01:37:14,352 --> 01:37:15,436
Orochimaru.

1251
01:37:23,337 --> 01:37:25,089
I found you.
