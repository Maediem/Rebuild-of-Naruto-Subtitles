1
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,184
<i>I was nervous and couldn't sleep.</i>

2
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,319
<i>First...it's him...
in the first match.</i>

3
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:54,239
<i>Not even my Sharingan
can see chakra points...</i>

4
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:59,494
<i>The strongest genin in the
Leaf is on my team.</i>

5
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:03,498
<i>It is that...Neji Hyuga!</i>

6
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:05,984
<i>Neji...Neji...Neji...</i>

7
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,192
At last...

8
00:02:34,914 --> 00:02:37,250
The first match is Neji Hyuga, right?!

9
00:02:37,931 --> 00:02:40,642
Yeah. He's the number one rookie
from last year, right?!

10
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,704
We can't miss the first match!

11
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,376
<i>Neji...Hyuga...</i>

12
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:56,050
Now I can summon a frog...
It'll be okay.

13
00:03:00,975 --> 00:03:04,781
<i>They all...look nasty.</i>

14
00:03:20,524 --> 00:03:21,440
Hinata!

15
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,995
Ah! N-N-Naruto.

16
00:03:24,457 --> 00:03:26,417
W-What are you doing here?

17
00:03:26,808 --> 00:03:28,476
Today is the final round, isn't it?

18
00:03:31,221 --> 00:03:34,224
I...Just something...

19
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,508
I came to check out this training field.

20
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:41,260
This is the place where
I became a genin, so...

21
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,725
Really? W-Why?

22
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,270
N-Nothing...That doesn't matter!

23
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:53,733
Y-You're right. I'm sorry.

24
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,104
Say, Hinata...

25
00:03:58,798 --> 00:04:01,592
Neji's a relative of yours, right?

26
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,826
Y-Yes.

27
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:07,830
Is he really strong...?

28
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:11,959
Yes...

29
00:04:13,803 --> 00:04:14,721
I see.

30
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,644
B-But you might be able to win, Naruto.

31
00:04:19,747 --> 00:04:22,500
Yeah. I'm strong, after all!

32
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,650
I bet you can win, Naruto.

33
00:04:36,027 --> 00:04:36,670
What?

34
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,319
You know...

35
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,906
I...when you cheered for me,

36
00:04:42,307 --> 00:04:45,143
I felt like I was able to become
stronger than before.

37
00:04:45,601 --> 00:04:48,437
<i>Hinata! Hang tough!</i>

38
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,081
When the preliminaries ended,

39
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:53,001
I became able to like
myself just a little.

40
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:57,578
From someone else's standpoint,
it might not look like anything's changed.

41
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:02,026
but I feel like I was able to change.

42
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:07,849
I've been thinking that it was...
thanks to you, Naruto.

43
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,103
Say, Hinata...

44
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:16,024
Did you really think so?

45
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,524
What?

46
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:24,324
I may look strong to you,

47
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:28,161
but all I do is mess up...

48
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:32,206
And I act tough because
I'm frustrated.

49
00:05:32,385 --> 00:05:33,886
It's not like that!

50
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,378
Even when you messed up,

51
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,384
in my view...you were always
a proud failure.

52
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:49,849
W-When I look at you,
it impacts my heart.

53
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,560
You're not perfect, so...

54
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,062
So...

55
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,732
It's because you mess up...

56
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,402
that you have the strength
to rise up from that.

57
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:07,575
I think such strength is
true strength.

58
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:13,539
I...I think you're an
incredibly strong person.

59
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,296
Thanks, Hinata!

60
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,134
Even though I was always
the bottom one...

61
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:28,043
I was tense in the shoulders, somehow!

62
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,776
I was depressed,
which was totally not my character.

63
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,684
But I feel better now!

64
00:06:34,623 --> 00:06:36,020
Naruto...

65
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,107
Okay! I'm off to the match!

66
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:44,695
Hinata...

67
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,071
Huh?

68
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,867
I kind of...thought you were...

69
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,869
<i>W-What...?</i>

70
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,873
...gloomy, hesitant and weird.

71
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,792
<i>Naruto...</i>

72
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,212
But I quite like...people...

73
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,967
like you!

74
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:12,851
Oh, yeah! Be sure to come watch me
kick that Neji's butt!

75
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:19,730
Uh oh. Time to run!

76
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,274
I-I'm late, late!

77
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,609
See you later, Hinata!

78
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:29,103
Sorry I'm late, Hinata.

79
00:07:29,594 --> 00:07:32,513
Well, Shino's match isn't until
quite a bit later, so...

80
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,538
Hm? Hey? Hinata?

81
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,925
Hmm? Where's Sasuke?

82
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,511
That Dosu guy I'm supposed
to fight isn't here, either.

83
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,555
Hey, you guys over there.

84
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:58,019
Throw out your chests and
show your faces to the spectators!

85
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,291
You guys are the stars
of this "final round"!

86
00:08:23,053 --> 00:08:25,806
Sasuke hasn't been found yet?

87
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,550
A team of several ANBU members
are searching all over,

88
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:31,169
but they have found nothing.

89
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:34,597
He might already be in
the hands of Orochimaru...

90
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:38,643
If that's the case,
we may never find him.

91
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,353
I understand.

92
00:08:43,844 --> 00:08:47,806
Well well...Lord Kazekage.

93
00:08:55,566 --> 00:08:58,611
You must be tired having
come all this way.

94
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:02,208
No...I'm glad the arena
is in the Leaf Village.

95
00:09:03,258 --> 00:09:07,721
Even though you're still young, it would
probably be a tough journey for you

96
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:10,510
if you had to go to the trouble
of traveling someplace else.

97
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,968
Shouldn't you decide on
the Fifth Hokage soon?

98
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:24,188
Please don't treat me
like an old person.

99
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,775
I'm still planning on
being Hokage for another five years...

100
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,575
Now then, I guess it's
about time to begin.

101
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:46,252
Everyone, thank you very much
for coming

102
00:09:46,277 --> 00:09:50,990
to the Village Hidden in Leaves
Chunin Exam.

103
00:09:51,774 --> 00:09:55,008
We will now begin the
"final round" matches

104
00:09:55,033 --> 00:09:58,745
for the eight who made it
through the preliminaries!

105
00:09:59,227 --> 00:10:02,439
Please watch until the end!

106
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:08,691
If there are supposed to be eight,
it looks like there's one missing.

107
00:10:10,713 --> 00:10:13,599
I have something to tell
you before the match.

108
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,408
Look at this.

109
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:18,783
Huh?!

110
00:10:22,543 --> 00:10:25,338
There was a slight change
to the tournament.

111
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,962
Check who you'll be facing
one more time.

112
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:35,005
<i>Before I had more preliminary
matches than the others...</i>

113
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,471
<i>So that Dosu guy dropped out?</i>

114
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,433
Say...

115
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:44,768
...say.

116
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,270
What?

117
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,565
Umm...Sasuke still hasn't come.

118
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:50,983
What'll happen?

119
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:56,238
In case a competitor does not arrive
by the start time of his match...

120
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,076
he or she will lose by default!

121
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,413
<i>It doesn't make sense.</i>

122
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:08,668
<i>Knowing his character,
he'd come even if he had to drag himself.</i>

123
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,471
<i>Where are you going, Gaara?</i>

124
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,392
<i>To verify my existence...
one more time.</i>

125
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,898
Sasuke one more time...

126
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,318
What happened?

127
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,156
It's obvious that you're there
standing with the thirst for blood.

128
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,741
Why don't you come out?

129
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,290
So you're called Gaara...

130
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,378
What is it that you want to say
to him before the final round,

131
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,413
by pursuing him so far?

132
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,758
A battle is where...

133
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,805
another's existence and one's own
existence are put on the line...

134
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,642
and each tries to kill the other!

135
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:13,983
Only the winner can actually feel
the value of his own existence.

136
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,360
In other words,
what you want to say is...

137
00:12:16,385 --> 00:12:19,722
"Let's have a killing bout and
not a match"?

138
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:25,202
Uchiha...You really should
be wanting it, too...

139
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,747
in the depths of your soul...

140
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,667
You want to confirm
the value of your existence.

141
00:12:32,221 --> 00:12:35,474
Am I really, truly powerful?

142
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,073
Is my existence more powerful
than my opponent

143
00:12:39,361 --> 00:12:41,863
who faces me with eyes
filled with intent to kill?

144
00:13:00,462 --> 00:13:01,672
<i>Could it be...?</i>

145
00:13:01,957 --> 00:13:04,626
<i>Even after I warned him to avoid
doing anything to stand out...</i>

146
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,742
<i>He didn't kill Sasuke Uchiha
also, did he...?</i>

147
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,210
Listen up, you guys.

148
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:18,397
The terrain is different,
but the rule is that there are no rules,

149
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:19,715
the same as
in the preliminaries.

150
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:25,014
The matches will continue until one
or the other dies, or acknowledges defeat.

151
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:33,229
However, if I judge that it has been
settled I'll stop the match there.

152
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,397
Arguments will not be allowed.

153
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,525
Understood?

154
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,488
So the first match is...

155
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,907
Naruto Uzumaki.

156
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,826
Neji Hyuga

157
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:51,330
Just those two remain and
the rest of you go to the waiting room.

158
00:13:58,187 --> 00:14:00,625
Hey, Hinata! These seats are open.

159
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,172
Uh huh.

160
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,264
This match will be quite interesting

161
00:14:10,853 --> 00:14:14,478
But to think that brat would
survive until this point...

162
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,190
I wonder if this is
as far as it goes

163
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,155
for those who survived
just by luck, after all.

164
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,861
That Naruto.

165
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,181
This is not a good opponent at all.

166
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,826
No matter how you look at it,
he can't beat the Hyuga clan.

167
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:32,788
<i>Well, that's what I thought
at the beginning...</i>

168
00:14:33,117 --> 00:14:37,163
<i>But you'll all be surprised
if you underestimate him.</i>

169
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,215
Akamaru, what's wrong?

170
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,425
What did you say?!

171
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,137
<i>What?! Where?!</i>

172
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,268
<i>There!</i>

173
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,066
<i>What's ANBU, the Black Ops,
doing here?</i>

174
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,694
<i>Is something going on...?</i>

175
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:15,690
You seem like you want
to say something

176
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:18,296
I said it before, didn't I?

177
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,004
I'll win, no matter what!

178
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,054
<i>He has the look...
of being sure of himself...</i>

179
00:15:30,883 --> 00:15:32,926
<i>It's as if he's not all worked up...</i>

180
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,728
That makes it
more worthwhile for me.

181
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:41,440
I look forward to your look
of disappointment...

182
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:46,278
when you know the true reality...

183
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,572
Stop whining.

184
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:56,997
Let's...get started!

185
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,797
Now then, round one.

186
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,631
Begin!

187
00:16:24,988 --> 00:16:26,906
Watch carefully, Hanabi.

188
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:31,907
Nobody has inherited such
a strong Hyuga kekkei genkai.

189
00:16:32,689 --> 00:16:35,108
To say nothing of your older sister.

190
00:16:36,232 --> 00:16:37,496
More than big sister?

191
00:16:37,953 --> 00:16:40,289
Perhaps more than you, too.

192
00:17:10,892 --> 00:17:12,352
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

193
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,370
<i>You used your head,
didn't you, Naruto?!</i>

194
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,164
<i>With the Shadow Clone Jutsu...</i>

195
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,083
Heh. He's an interesting kid.

196
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,795
Shadow Clone Jutsu is
a jonin level technique.

197
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:30,174
To think he could use
such an jutsu...

198
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,469
Who knows how this'll turn out?

199
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:39,933
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu?!</i>

200
00:17:40,992 --> 00:17:45,831
<i>I get it. If chakra is evenly distributed
among the clones,</i>

201
00:17:46,016 --> 00:17:50,395
<i>indeed, I can't detect the
real one even with my Byakugan.</i>

202
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:55,088
But there's only one real one,
after all!

203
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:58,452
Heh. Don't be acting tough!

204
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,413
If you're going to come,
then come.

205
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,751
It's pointless.

206
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:12,633
In front of that Neji's defense,
it's not just all attacking.

207
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,150
Damn it!

208
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,568
I'll get you next time!

209
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,900
Here!

210
00:18:46,903 --> 00:18:48,196
This guy...

211
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:02,349
Does he have eyes behind him?

212
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,112
You're going to become...
the Hokage...?

213
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,283
With this level, it's impossible.

214
00:19:22,471 --> 00:19:26,475
I can generally tell
with these eyes...

215
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,907
Intrinsic abilities are set.

216
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:35,677
Figuratively speaking,
everything inherent about people is set.

217
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,048
Why...?

218
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:48,061
Why are you always so
judgmental like that?

219
00:19:48,371 --> 00:19:52,166
Then...are you going to say
that anybody can become the Hokage...

220
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,525
if they just work hard?

221
00:19:56,549 --> 00:20:00,720
Only a very small percentage of
shinobi are chosen to be the Hokage!

222
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,076
Look more at reality!

223
00:20:04,335 --> 00:20:07,797
Those who become the Hokage
are born with a destiny.

224
00:20:08,942 --> 00:20:11,403
It's not something you become
by trying to become it.

225
00:20:11,906 --> 00:20:14,200
It's determined by fate.

226
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,901
People must live within
their different respective currents

227
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,802
that can't be defied.

228
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:30,981
The one single...
destiny everyone has equally...

229
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:40,948
...is death.

230
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:49,539
<i>Those eyes...</i>

231
00:20:50,237 --> 00:20:53,073
<i>He still holds a grudge
against the head family, huh?</i>

232
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:56,964
So...

233
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,259
So what?!

234
00:21:02,567 --> 00:21:07,989
I don't know when to give up!
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

235
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,575
<i>His opponent is that Neji, huh...?</i>

236
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,745
<i>The Final Round is altogether different
than the preliminaries...</i>

237
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,956
<i>After all, Naruto may not be able to...</i>

238
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:42,009
Entertain me a little, Naruto.

239
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:47,639
I've got a tough job waiting
for me now, so...

240
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:20,881
Damn it. I can't catch him at all.

241
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:26,136
I told you I'm not
such a fool, didn't I?

242
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:33,435
<i>I already know...
which one is the real one.</i>

243
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,357
Oh.

244
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:43,407
That is the body
that has least attacks

245
00:22:43,432 --> 00:22:46,310
due to its fear of having
chakra points attacked.

246
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,023
The more you attack,

247
00:22:49,048 --> 00:22:51,008
the more that one body
becomes clearly evident.

248
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:52,996
This is as far as it goes.

249
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,920
I said it was pointless.

250
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:07,260
I've been telling you not
to frivolously assume things.

251
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:09,929
What?

252
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,472
It can't be.

253
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:19,773
All right! Go, Naruto!

254
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,840
<i>Naruto!</i>

255
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:27,406
<i>He foiled my idea and purposely
and drew one of his clones back?</i>

256
00:23:28,111 --> 00:23:32,449
I've been striking from the beginning,
prepared for an honorable death!

257
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:33,619
Believe it!

258
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:35,996
<i>I did it.</i>

259
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:55,392
W-What was that?

260
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,437
Did you think you'd won?

261
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,566
That...

262
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:08,108
Rotation...

263
00:24:12,205 --> 00:24:15,000
You punk.
Don't make a fool of me.

264
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:23,587
<i>The largest range of vision of
Neji's Byakugan is nearly 360 degrees.</i>

265
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:28,175
<i>And he detects all of his opponent's
attacks with the Byakugan.</i>

266
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,513
<i>His defense technique,
the 8 Trigrams Palms Rotation,</i>

267
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:34,765
<i>will begin from here.</i>

268
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:58,133
<i>The moment he's attacked,
he discharges a large amount of chakra</i>

269
00:24:58,158 --> 00:25:02,100
<i>from the chakra holes in his body,
blocks the enemy's attack with that chakra</i>

270
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:06,254
<i>moves his own body in a circular motion,
dodges, and repels.</i>

271
00:25:07,698 --> 00:25:12,062
<i>Essentially, it's difficult to control
the chakra discharged from chakra holes...</i>

272
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:15,847
<i>To the extent that even jonin utilize
the discharge from a part of the body,</i>

273
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,724
<i>like the hands and feet,
in techniques.</i>

274
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:22,354
<i>But Neji, who has mastered
Gentle Fist, discharges chakra</i>

275
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:25,565
<i>from his entire body and
shuts out physical attacks</i>

276
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,425
<i>just with that discharge power.</i>

277
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,070
<i>In other words,</i>

278
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:33,048
<i>that's one more absolute defense</i>

279
00:25:33,466 --> 00:25:36,344
<i>that has more power
than that Gaara's Sand Shield.</i>

280
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,381
T-That's father's...

281
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:42,241
Rotation is a secret art passed down
from generation to generation

282
00:25:42,266 --> 00:25:45,045
only to the Hyuga head family.

283
00:25:46,265 --> 00:25:48,643
He created that on his own?

284
00:25:49,455 --> 00:25:52,667
He's quite the guy...
To think he'd come this far.

285
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:58,680
<i>It's much too soon to be surprised.
Neji's true power is still to come.</i>

286
00:26:00,346 --> 00:26:01,556
Damn it.

287
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,687
This is the end.

288
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:08,650
You're within the area of my 8 Trigrams.

289
00:26:20,368 --> 00:26:21,899
<i>Gentle Fist Art:</i>

290
00:26:23,184 --> 00:26:24,872
<i>8 Trigrams 64 Palms.</i>

291
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,419
It can't be.

292
00:26:26,882 --> 00:26:27,924
That pose.

293
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,512
<i>8 Tetragrams...</i>

294
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,680
<i>...2 Palms!</i>

295
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:41,473
<i>4 Palms.</i>

296
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:43,892
<i>8 Palms.</i>

297
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,521
<i>16 Palms.</i>

298
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,107
<i>32 Palms.</i>

299
00:26:52,186 --> 00:26:54,146
<i>64 Palms!</i>

300
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:01,703
<i>The branch family exceeds
the head family?</i>

301
00:27:10,124 --> 00:27:14,263
<i>Hizashi...You should have
succeeded the Hyuga family.</i>

302
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,810
I pressed the 64 chakra points
all over your body...

303
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,222
You can't even stand.

304
00:27:24,516 --> 00:27:25,808
D-Damn it.

305
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:28,772
Are you frustrated?

306
00:27:28,997 --> 00:27:31,749
Kneeling down before power
that can't be changed

307
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,693
and knowing your powerlessness.

308
00:27:45,314 --> 00:27:46,648
<i>Bushy Brow...</i>

309
00:27:49,329 --> 00:27:50,372
<i>Hinata.</i>

310
00:27:57,707 --> 00:27:59,292
D-Damn it.

311
00:28:01,127 --> 00:28:01,919
Oh.

312
00:28:08,903 --> 00:28:09,903
Naruto.

313
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:24,202
He...No way.

314
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:27,624
I told you, didn't I...?

315
00:28:28,241 --> 00:28:32,120
I don't know when to give up.

316
00:28:37,166 --> 00:28:39,916
Hey, you're bleeding!

317
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,146
What's wrong?

318
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:45,565
You've still got damage
from the match.

319
00:28:47,951 --> 00:28:49,160
I'll take a look at her.

320
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,563
Who're you?

321
00:28:52,617 --> 00:28:54,786
I'm not suspicious or anything...

322
00:28:55,629 --> 00:28:56,943
Stop already...

323
00:28:57,341 --> 00:28:59,366
It'll be the same even if
you fight more than this.

324
00:28:59,536 --> 00:29:01,263
I don't have a grudge particularly
against you.

325
00:29:01,288 --> 00:29:04,759
Even if you say so,
I have something against you.

326
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,035
What are you talking about?

327
00:29:06,763 --> 00:29:11,351
Mocking Hinata, selfishly labeling
her a failure as you please.

328
00:29:11,607 --> 00:29:13,442
Head family, branch family...

329
00:29:13,486 --> 00:29:16,363
I don't know what happened to you.

330
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:23,052
But I won't forgive the jerk who'd
call another person a failure.

331
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:29,851
Hey, you.

332
00:29:30,092 --> 00:29:32,428
It's okay. I'm a doctor.

333
00:29:34,295 --> 00:29:36,691
Okay...Fine.

334
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:42,071
If you insist, I'll tell you about
the Hyuga's destiny of hatred.

335
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,324
In the Hyuga head family,
there's a secret ninjutsu

336
00:29:46,349 --> 00:29:48,389
that's been passed on
from generation to generation.

337
00:29:49,111 --> 00:29:50,613
That is the Curse Mark.

338
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:53,541
Curse Mark?

339
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:02,759
The Curse Mark represents
a bird in a cage...

340
00:30:03,437 --> 00:30:07,764
and it's a mark of those who are
bound to a destiny they can't escape.

341
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:22,570
W-What's...

342
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:35,503
...that mark?

343
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,878
One day when I was four years old,

344
00:30:39,148 --> 00:30:44,194
this accursed mark was inscribed
on my forehead with the Curse Mark Arts.

345
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:50,765
A large ceremony was held in
the Village Hidden in Leaves on that day.

346
00:30:51,507 --> 00:30:54,661
It was also the day when the
head ninja of the Land of Lightning,

347
00:30:54,872 --> 00:30:57,256
the land that the Leaf had
fought with for many years,

348
00:30:57,281 --> 00:31:00,216
came for the conclusion
of the allied treaty.

349
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:05,030
However, there was one clan...

350
00:31:05,386 --> 00:31:07,802
who didn't attend the ceremony
that was attended

351
00:31:07,827 --> 00:31:10,262
by everybody else,
from Leaf jonin to genin.

352
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,162
It was the Hyuga clan...

353
00:31:14,104 --> 00:31:16,486
And it's because that day
was the day of hope

354
00:31:16,511 --> 00:31:18,717
when the head family heir
was to turn three.

355
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:22,005
Miss Hinata's third birthday!

356
00:31:23,189 --> 00:31:25,441
My father, Hizashi Hyuga,

357
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:30,263
and Miss Hinata's father,
Lord Hiashi Hyuga were twin brothers.

358
00:31:31,626 --> 00:31:34,787
However Miss Hinata's father,
Lord Hiashi,

359
00:31:35,106 --> 00:31:38,855
was born into this world first
and became part of the head family.

360
00:31:39,562 --> 00:31:43,274
My father, who was the second son,
was born into the branch family.

361
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,715
So Miss Hinata is already three...

362
00:31:47,925 --> 00:31:49,384
Congratulations.

363
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:50,657
Thank you.

364
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:56,439
Lady Hinata…

365
00:31:56,464 --> 00:31:57,549
is a cute child.

366
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,001
Neji...

367
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,605
It is your destiny to protect her,

368
00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:06,363
and to protect
the Hyuga bloodline.

369
00:32:07,851 --> 00:32:10,228
The Hyuga...bloodline?

370
00:32:14,973 --> 00:32:16,142
Father!

371
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:17,644
Then...

372
00:32:18,155 --> 00:32:20,348
I'll be taking Neji
under my care, Hizashi.

373
00:32:20,908 --> 00:32:21,668
Yes.

374
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:26,377
When the head family heir grew
and became three years old,

375
00:32:28,838 --> 00:32:32,592
I had the Curse Mark imprinted on me
and I became the bird in the cage.

376
00:32:32,842 --> 00:32:36,012
This Curse Mark is the absolute fear
called death so to speak...

377
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,373
that was given to the branch family
by the head family.

378
00:32:39,431 --> 00:32:43,351
And this mark only goes away
at time of death.

379
00:32:44,532 --> 00:32:46,909
Sealing away the power
of the Byakugan.

380
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:55,306
The Hyuga clan possesses
the most distinctive kekkei genkai.

381
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:59,602
There's no end to those who target
the secret of that distinctive power.

382
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:05,942
In other words, this Curse Mark
keeps the branch family alive

383
00:33:06,624 --> 00:33:09,587
only to protect the head family
and does not allow disobedience.

384
00:33:09,711 --> 00:33:13,965
And it's an effective system created
to defend for eternity

385
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:16,445
the kekkei genkai called Byakugan.

386
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:20,887
And then, that incident occurred.

387
00:33:22,448 --> 00:33:27,328
My father was killed by
the head family.

388
00:33:31,435 --> 00:33:34,971
One night, Miss Hinata was
snatched up by someone.

389
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:51,696
At that time, Lord Hiashi immediately
rushed off and killed the abductor.

390
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:55,908
Who do you think that person was...

391
00:33:55,933 --> 00:34:00,104
who was in the shadows,
and also wearing a mask?

392
00:34:01,264 --> 00:34:05,238
It was the head ninja of
the Land of Lightning

393
00:34:05,614 --> 00:34:08,221
who had just completed
the allied treaty.

394
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:12,358
It was clear that he came targeting
the secret of Byakugan from the start.

395
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:17,372
However, the Land of Lightning
exploited the killing of their own ninja

396
00:34:17,397 --> 00:34:18,940
due to a botched plan...

397
00:34:19,503 --> 00:34:23,534
and set an outrageous condition in
violation of the treaty.

398
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,831
The Lightning demanded the body
of the head Hyuga

399
00:34:27,055 --> 00:34:29,849
who possessed Byakugan,
the kekkei genkai...

400
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:34,739
In other words,
the body of Lord Hiashi.

401
00:34:37,439 --> 00:34:40,192
And the Leaf accepted the condition.

402
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,955
What? But, father...

403
00:34:43,953 --> 00:34:46,956
And war was safely avoided.

404
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:54,050
Thanks to my father who was killed
as a body double of Hiashi Hyuga,

405
00:34:54,075 --> 00:34:56,243
to protect the head family!

406
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:01,599
Other than dying, there's no other way
to escape this accursed Curse Mark.

407
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:05,829
Even though they were twins
with nearly equal power,

408
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:11,483
their destinies were already set by
who was born first and born later.

409
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:19,075
And then, this match...

410
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:23,838
Your destiny was decided at the point
when I became your opponent.

411
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:28,084
You don't know until you try!

412
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,780
Your father was killed a long time ago

413
00:35:40,951 --> 00:35:43,453
and I don't know the extent
of the pain you've felt...

414
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:49,729
But it's a huge mistake for you to think
that has determined your entire destiny!

415
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,608
You're hopeless...

416
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:03,244
Proctor...it's over.

417
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,373
You failure...

418
00:36:11,407 --> 00:36:13,439
Don't...run away.

419
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:21,027
I won't...run...

420
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:25,195
I'll...stand by my own words...

421
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:28,978
That's my Ninja Way!

422
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,316
I think I've heard that line before...

423
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:37,069
You with your destiny stuff...

424
00:36:38,364 --> 00:36:39,281
I won't lose...

425
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:42,617
to a jerk with cold feet like you,
no matter what!

426
00:36:42,865 --> 00:36:47,620
A brat who knows nothing
shouldn't lecture arrogantly!

427
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,474
You can't possibly understand

428
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:54,629
the destiny of being burdened with
a mark that cannot be wiped off for life!

429
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:07,682
Yeah...

430
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:10,262
I do understand it.

431
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:16,817
So...what of it?

432
00:37:17,848 --> 00:37:19,119
<i>This brat!</i>

433
00:37:22,054 --> 00:37:23,764
Don't be acting cool...

434
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:28,996
It's not just you who's special!

435
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:38,705
Hinata was also...
suffering the same as you!

436
00:37:39,743 --> 00:37:42,877
Even though she's the head family,
not being acknowledged as such...

437
00:37:42,902 --> 00:37:44,486
trying desperately to change herself...

438
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:51,018
She fought you while coughing
up blood with that in mind!

439
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,896
You too!

440
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,830
The branch family that
protects the head family...

441
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,527
Doing all that to Hinata
just because it's an exam.

442
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,197
In actuality, you were just as frantic

443
00:38:03,222 --> 00:38:04,902
in attempting to go
against destiny, right?

444
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:12,415
<i>Vitality has returned to Hinata's face!</i>

445
00:38:13,773 --> 00:38:15,533
<i>Just what I'd expect of
the ANBU Black Ops...</i>

446
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,670
She'll be okay.

447
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,548
Now she needs bed rest.

448
00:38:27,269 --> 00:38:30,397
Your chakra points are now shut...

449
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:35,313
How are you, who can't use chakra
for awhile, planning to fight?

450
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:43,529
<i>You possess two kinds of chakra...</i>

451
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:47,491
<i>You must extract and utilize, at any time,</i>

452
00:38:47,516 --> 00:38:51,437
<i>the other huge chakra that
has rested inside you from the start...</i>

453
00:38:53,011 --> 00:38:56,932
<i>That's it. The Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra...
I'll use that...</i>

454
00:39:01,076 --> 00:39:04,830
<i>Stinking fox...Help me out!</i>

455
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,055
This is as far as the talking goes.

456
00:39:09,885 --> 00:39:13,874
Proctor...I'm going to fight with
the intent to kill him!

457
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,604
If you're going to stop me,
please feel free.

458
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:19,749
Jeez.

459
00:39:25,689 --> 00:39:28,567
It's futile...I closed the chakra points

460
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:36,874
<i>Oh, yeah! Be sure to come
watch me kick that Neji's butt!</i>

461
00:39:38,357 --> 00:39:41,485
<i>A failure beats down
a genius with effort...</i>

462
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,810
Why do you try to go against
your destiny that much?

463
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,319
Because I was called...

464
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,947
a failure!

465
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,388
<i>It's twisting...</i>

466
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:39,562
<i>What's that?!
Is that even chakra?!</i>

467
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:52,657
Here I go!

468
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,297
<i>Rotation!</i>

469
00:41:32,541 --> 00:41:33,541
You!

470
00:41:35,794 --> 00:41:38,380
You're confident in close combat, right?!

471
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:47,171
I don't know what the
Hyuga destiny of hatred is!

472
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:52,218
But if you're going to say it's futile,
you don't have to do anything

473
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:54,263
<i>This is bad! I must use the Rotation!</i>

474
00:41:55,109 --> 00:41:56,903
After I become the Hokage...

475
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,877
I'll change Hyuga!

476
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:36,637
<i>What chakra...</i>

477
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,558
<i>That kid showed some enormous strength...</i>

478
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,352
<i>The Hyuga kid is probably...</i>

479
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:18,137
Failure boy...
Sorry, but this is the reality...

480
00:43:19,273 --> 00:43:20,441
Now this is really the en-

481
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:37,655
My body...

482
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:51,879
In those conditions,

483
00:43:51,904 --> 00:43:53,824
you used the Shadow Clone Jutsu
just like that...

484
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,175
The ninjutsu that you're good at, huh?

485
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,052
I was careless...

486
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:08,562
I've...failed the graduation
exam three times...

487
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,191
As luck would have it,

488
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:15,261
the ninjutsu tests that appeared
on the graduation exam were always...

489
00:44:16,209 --> 00:44:20,464
infallibly the ninjutsu I stunk at.

490
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:28,666
Clone jutsu was the ninjutsu...
I stunk at.

491
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:37,883
Don't be whining about boring stuff
like destiny and what not,

492
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,763
and how it can't be changed!

493
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:46,725
Because unlike me...
you're not a failure.

494
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:05,746
Winner of this match is Naruto Uzumaki.

495
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:17,089
That was awesome!

496
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:18,589
Well done!

497
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,718
That was a great fight!

498
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:33,796
Yay!

499
00:45:36,249 --> 00:45:39,044
<i>And he still has the energy
to run around...</i>

500
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:42,531
<i>Man...He's got crazy stamina that guy...</i>

501
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:45,701
<i>That Naruto...</i>

502
00:45:45,968 --> 00:45:47,345
<i>He keeps getting stronger...</i>

503
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,788
He did it...that kid.

504
00:45:50,033 --> 00:45:52,244
Yeah! He's on the right track!

505
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,293
And he's a little cute...

506
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:58,797
<i>Something about it...</i>

507
00:45:59,028 --> 00:46:00,279
<i>I'm envious of you...</i>

508
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:05,429
<i>Watching your battle makes me think
that I have to work really hard too...</i>

509
00:46:05,875 --> 00:46:07,502
<i>That's amazing, you know?</i>

510
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:16,815
He won. Is it for real?

511
00:46:17,211 --> 00:46:21,507
I thought he was the same as me,
in the not going anywhere class...

512
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:23,197
Not going anywhere?

513
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,699
Now people are squealing...

514
00:46:25,724 --> 00:46:27,743
Looks like he's part of the group
that's going somewhere.

515
00:46:27,768 --> 00:46:30,146
Maybe I couldn't beat him...

516
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:34,208
This is really bad.
It kinda depresses me...

517
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:38,170
To retain himself and draw out
the chakra of the Nine-Tailed Fox...

518
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:42,633
Yeah...Most of the Leaf Village people
here are surprised.

519
00:46:43,547 --> 00:46:45,006
<i>That Naruto...</i>

520
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:49,765
<i>When did he learn to control the strength
of Nine-Tailed Fox to that extent?</i>

521
00:46:55,827 --> 00:46:58,830
Even a bird who gets caught,
once it learns how,

522
00:46:58,855 --> 00:47:02,483
will open the lid of its basket
with its own beak.

523
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:11,703
He won't give up, for he wants to
fly freely in the sky again.

524
00:47:20,918 --> 00:47:22,843
This time you lost!

525
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:30,764
It's buzzing.

526
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:33,183
That's because it was a good battle...

527
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:36,937
Certainly, there's that too, but...

528
00:47:38,407 --> 00:47:44,747
It's likely that, for the curious heads
of ninja and the feudal lords,

529
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:47,993
there is no match they look forward to
more than this next match.

530
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,288
There's been no news of Sasuke.

531
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:56,456
And there's the issue of Orochimaru.

532
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:59,495
Before everyone starts to make noise,
we should disqualify him...

533
00:48:00,067 --> 00:48:03,689
What's going on?!
Hurry up and start the next match!

534
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,557
How long are you going to
make us wait!

535
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:07,083
Before night falls!

536
00:48:08,985 --> 00:48:12,155
I wonder what's going on
with the next match?

537
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,016
Is Sasuke here?

538
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:16,768
<i>Sasuke...</i>

539
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:21,565
That guy...
What in the world is he doing?!

540
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,191
Is he planning to not show up?

541
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:26,945
A wise man never courts danger...

542
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:28,947
A wise judgement...is it?

543
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,325
What are you saying?

544
00:48:31,962 --> 00:48:34,984
He'll definitely come! Believe it!

545
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:51,303
<i>But seriously, what is he doing?</i>

546
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:54,890
<i>Keep this up and he...
he'll be disqualified.</i>

547
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:57,851
There's no choice...

548
00:48:59,652 --> 00:49:02,447
Sasuke is...disqualified.

549
00:49:02,671 --> 00:49:03,315
Yes.

550
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:07,361
Lord Hokage...

551
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:11,406
I want you to consider waiting a little
bit for Sasuke Uchiha's disqualification.

552
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:14,660
I understand your point, but...

553
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,913
No matter how excellent the shinobi,

554
00:49:18,089 --> 00:49:20,884
to make light of time is not
a qualification for chunin.

555
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,502
If there's no clear reason to satisfy

556
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:26,655
the heads of ninja and feudal lords
who are here,

557
00:49:26,957 --> 00:49:28,834
there's no reason to wait for him!

558
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:32,072
I see...

559
00:49:33,308 --> 00:49:35,806
Well then, there is a sufficient reason.

560
00:49:37,691 --> 00:49:39,326
Including myself...

561
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:42,521
most of the heads of ninja and
feudal lords that are here...

562
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:46,149
came here because they want to see
the next match specifically.

563
00:49:49,655 --> 00:49:50,655
However...

564
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:54,449
He's the remaining survivor
of the "Uchiha."

565
00:49:54,934 --> 00:49:59,424
Land of the Wind too, absolutely,
is hoping for a bout with our Gaara.

566
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:02,415
Lord Hokage...

567
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:06,795
<i>There's no guarantee that
Sasuke will come but...</i>

568
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,715
All right then...

569
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:14,553
We shall specially postpone
this match and wait.

570
00:50:16,928 --> 00:50:19,431
Lord Hokage! Really...

571
00:50:20,409 --> 00:50:22,019
Inform the Proctor!

572
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,271
Y-Yes.

573
00:50:27,344 --> 00:50:28,374
However...

574
00:50:29,084 --> 00:50:33,338
It's rare for you to insist like that,
Lord Kazekage.

575
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:34,703
Well...

576
00:50:35,098 --> 00:50:38,602
To show off the shinobi's qualities
of our village to the feudal lords...

577
00:50:39,271 --> 00:50:41,462
there's no better opponent
than an Uchiha.

578
00:50:42,327 --> 00:50:44,434
It's a chance for us as well.

579
00:50:44,653 --> 00:50:46,947
C'mon, what happened to the match?!

580
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:49,755
What happened to Uchiha?!

581
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:52,966
I understand...

582
00:50:56,636 --> 00:51:02,350
Everyone! The candidate for the
next battle has not arrived here!

583
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:08,359
We'll briefly postpone this battle and
start the following battle ahead of it.

584
00:51:11,142 --> 00:51:13,853
What is he doing...that Sasuke?

585
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:17,908
Great,
so Sasuke didn't get disqualified!

586
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:24,998
That's good...

587
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:29,961
Hey! That means my match
is one match closer!

588
00:51:31,253 --> 00:51:33,171
Then, onto the next pair!

589
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:36,718
Kankuro and Shino Aburame!
Come down!

590
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:42,182
<i>My match...doesn't matter at all.</i>

591
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:46,895
<i>More importantly...</i>

592
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:52,984
<i>I'd rather not expose the Mechanism
of Crow to the enemy before the plan...</i>

593
00:51:55,928 --> 00:51:56,928
Proctor!

594
00:51:57,332 --> 00:51:58,583
I abstain!

595
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:00,491
<i>What?!</i>

596
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:04,996
I abstain!
Please advance the matches!

597
00:52:09,302 --> 00:52:13,723
Due to Kankuro's abstention,
Shino Aburame wins by default!

598
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:15,215
What's that all about?!

599
00:52:15,291 --> 00:52:16,291
Have a proper match!

600
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:32,857
You are...?

601
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:34,526
It's my turn, isn't it?

602
00:52:34,921 --> 00:52:37,382
It seems that you're really fired up.

603
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:40,532
Okay, let's go to the next match.

604
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:43,660
Hey! The last one, come down!

605
00:52:43,838 --> 00:52:47,925
Hey! Hey! What are you doing,
frivolously building things up?

606
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:53,712
I mean, why does only
my match have to be modified?

607
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:56,506
Shikamaru Nara! You!

608
00:52:56,942 --> 00:52:59,861
<i>Damn...
If it's like this I'll abstain too...</i>

609
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:03,221
C'mon! Shikamaru, fight hard!

610
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:29,539
<i>That damn Naruto...</i>

611
00:53:30,328 --> 00:53:32,580
- C'mon!
- Hurry up with the match!

612
00:53:32,831 --> 00:53:33,915
Finish it up already!

613
00:53:35,722 --> 00:53:36,882
Stand up and start the match!

614
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:48,767
<i>Evidently, people don't want to
see the minor players matches</i>

615
00:53:49,128 --> 00:53:51,742
<i>since they were really looking
forward to Sasuke's match...</i>

616
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:56,566
What? You're giving up, too?

617
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,946
<i>My opponent's a girl again?</i>

618
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:04,658
<i>That kid has had zero fighting spirit
from the beginning...</i>

619
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,577
C'mon! What is he doing?!

620
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:11,790
C'mon Shikamaru!
Get it together and do it!

621
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:14,459
If you don't come, I'll go!

622
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,962
Hey! Haven't started yet...

623
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:21,261
Man, that girl is so gung ho.

624
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:42,946
It doesn't really matter if
I become a chunin or not.

625
00:54:43,763 --> 00:54:47,225
But there's no reason why
a man should lose to a woman.

626
00:54:48,753 --> 00:54:50,421
Well...let's do it!

627
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:09,264
<i>This guy's quick to run away...</i>

628
00:55:13,846 --> 00:55:17,767
<i>Nor any reason why a man should
rough up a woman.</i>

629
00:55:19,484 --> 00:55:21,152
<i>But I don't want to be
roughed up either.</i>

630
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,979
<i>He's probably trying to lure me into the
trees where there're lots of shadows...</i>

631
00:55:26,549 --> 00:55:27,675
<i>but I won't let him.</i>

632
00:55:28,598 --> 00:55:32,269
<i>Why am I the only one who always
gets a woman for an opponent, cripes?!</i>

633
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:39,061
Shikamaru! You get her with
a torrent of 16 combination...!

634
00:55:41,029 --> 00:55:42,697
Mind if I sit here?

635
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:43,817
Huh?

636
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:47,719
What...you?
Your stomach okay?

637
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:55,060
What? Wasn't Sasuke's match next?

638
00:55:55,525 --> 00:55:56,525
Shh!

639
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:03,401
Everything's fine, right, Sakura?
After all, it's Sasuke, right?

640
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:07,739
<i>R-Right now, I should leave her alone.</i>

641
00:56:08,994 --> 00:56:11,496
It looks like Shikamaru taking part
in this final battle,

642
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:13,620
it seems like he's in the wrong place.

643
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:15,469
Don't say that!

644
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:19,168
I certainly don't think that
he has any great techniques,

645
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:23,254
but that Shikamaru is
always good at strategizing.

646
00:56:23,815 --> 00:56:28,320
That's why I feel like we ended up
in the preliminary round the other day.

647
00:56:28,943 --> 00:56:30,778
Hmm, yeah well...

648
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,973
And after all, he jumped down
into the arena himself.

649
00:56:35,165 --> 00:56:38,002
He seems uncharacteristically driven.

650
00:56:38,509 --> 00:56:41,304
Even he can be passionate
once in a while!

651
00:56:41,811 --> 00:56:44,397
Go! Shikamaru!

652
00:56:46,805 --> 00:56:52,140
<i>Geez, I envy a cloud being so free...</i>

653
00:56:56,151 --> 00:57:00,247
<i>I guess I pretty much
am completely without desire...</i>

654
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:02,878
<i>Even the reason why I became a ninja...</i>

655
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:06,798
<i>was because I thought
I would have a fun life, ya know...</i>

656
00:57:15,885 --> 00:57:20,114
<i>But...of course, it's not that easy.</i>

657
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:23,982
<i>What's going on with that stupid face?!
Is he underestimating me?</i>

658
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:26,025
<i>Ninja Art: Wind Scythe Jutsu!</i>

659
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:44,127
<i>That's right, with this attack,
my armed attacks also were beaten down.</i>

660
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:00,393
I see...

661
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:09,819
Shadow Possession Jutsu!
I've seen that true identity!

662
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:13,172
Evidently there's a limit to
the stretching and shortening

663
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:15,825
changing shape of the shadow...

664
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,429
No matter how much you
change the shape of the shadow,

665
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:19,453
even when you stretch it,

666
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:23,208
it can only span up to
the size of your own shadow.

667
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:25,599
That's right isn't it?

668
00:58:27,268 --> 00:58:28,268
You got it...

669
00:58:29,447 --> 00:58:32,075
<i>Even if I assume that he's made up
the distance,</i>

670
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:35,762
<i>by stretching his shadow from the edge
of the shadow of the arena wall...</i>

671
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:38,844
<i>This is the limit to how far
the shadow can stretch.</i>

672
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:42,352
<i>This is the scope of his attack!</i>

673
00:58:43,833 --> 00:58:46,044
<i>15 meters, 32 centimeters!</i>

674
00:58:46,816 --> 00:58:48,985
<i>She took the distance
with the folding fan.</i>

675
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:52,906
<i>Temari is stronger at long distance
battles than she is at close range...</i>

676
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,823
<i>the outcome has already been decided.</i>

677
00:59:14,629 --> 00:59:16,589
What? What is that sign...?

678
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:22,499
That's no sign.
That's like, his habit.

679
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,226
Habit?

680
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:31,292
He enjoys passing time slowly.
That guy's like an old man.

681
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:34,237
That's why he likes
Japanese checkers and chess

682
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:37,160
and always makes me be his opponent.

683
00:59:42,787 --> 00:59:45,790
When he's stuck on a move,
he always does that.

684
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:54,090
Why?

685
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:57,068
He's working out his strategy.

686
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:09,272
And, I've never beaten him.

687
01:00:10,463 --> 01:00:13,526
A strategy...
but this is an actual fight.

688
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:15,361
It's different from a game.

689
01:00:15,816 --> 01:00:18,795
But it's said that formation pieces
that were used to build battle strategy

690
01:00:19,008 --> 01:00:21,219
eventually become
game pieces.

691
01:00:22,004 --> 01:00:25,299
Shikamaru is like a brilliant general.

692
01:00:26,042 --> 01:00:27,043
Wait a minute.

693
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:30,793
When we grouped the genin,
I saw his scores.

694
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:33,854
They were at about the
same level of that Naruto's.

695
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:38,801
He said that moving his pencil during
written exams at the academy is a pain,

696
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:41,471
and during the tests,
he always sleeps instead.

697
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:42,929
A pain...?

698
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:47,477
He was so good at strategy games,
I felt something wasn't right...

699
01:00:48,402 --> 01:00:52,239
so I had him take an IQ test
under the pretense that it was a game.

700
01:00:56,051 --> 01:00:57,594
He was more than brilliant.

701
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:02,200
With an IQ of over 200,
he's a super genius!

702
01:01:03,667 --> 01:01:05,336
T-Two hundred?!

703
01:01:15,470 --> 01:01:17,783
Looks like you've got some
fighting spirit now...

704
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:27,850
It's pointless to hide!

705
01:01:35,327 --> 01:01:37,455
I wonder if he's really got a strategy...

706
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:39,821
M-Maybe...

707
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:42,323
With that he has no approach!

708
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,742
Shikamaru! Go for it!

709
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:46,786
It's pointless, isn't it?

710
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,996
He'll give up soon.

711
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,800
He hates things
that are a pain in the butt.

712
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:59,590
How long are you going to run away!
Cut it out!

713
01:02:10,768 --> 01:02:11,768
<i>It's no use.</i>

714
01:02:11,947 --> 01:02:13,657
<i>As long as I'm on the
outside of this line,</i>

715
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,064
<i>he absolutely can't catch me...</i>

716
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:18,234
<i>No, wait! Close call!</i>

717
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:22,697
You caught on well.

718
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:26,325
So you were dragging your feet
to wait for the sun to set...

719
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:29,441
in order to make the surface
of your own shadow larger

720
01:02:29,466 --> 01:02:32,260
by stretching the
shadow line of the wall.

721
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,377
As the sun goes down,
the shadows lengthen.

722
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:38,378
Isn't that so?

723
01:02:50,132 --> 01:02:52,176
<i>Even if I calculate the height
of the sun now</i>

724
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:54,937
<i>and the limit to the distance
of the previous attack,</i>

725
01:02:55,721 --> 01:02:58,089
<i>there's no mistaking the distance!</i>

726
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:05,421
Temari! Up!

727
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:10,619
<i>Darn it!</i>

728
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:15,458
I won't let you escape!

729
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:21,356
<i>I didn't expect that he would
create extra shadows to reach me</i>

730
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:23,249
<i>by making a parachute
with his jacket...!</i>

731
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:25,551
<i>A skillful technique!</i>

732
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:39,482
She's dodged this trick too...

733
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:48,491
<i>If this battle takes too long,</i>

734
01:03:48,731 --> 01:03:52,273
<i>the shadows in the arena will grow,
and his territory will increase.</i>

735
01:03:57,344 --> 01:03:58,704
<i>I'll defeat him with the next one!</i>

736
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:01,920
<i>Okay!</i>

737
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,341
<i>Clone...</i>

738
01:04:06,385 --> 01:04:07,746
<i>N-No way...!</i>

739
01:04:09,171 --> 01:04:12,405
<i>My...body is...?!</i>

740
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:20,606
At last...
Shadow Possession Jutsu is a success!

741
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,440
<i>What?!</i>

742
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:29,615
What's going on...?

743
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:31,283
That boy...

744
01:04:31,909 --> 01:04:34,161
How much is he planning ahead...?

745
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:37,415
That's Shikamaru's skill.

746
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:40,960
<i>Why...won't my body move?!</i>

747
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:43,880
<i>The shadow shouldn't
have reached this far.</i>

748
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:48,801
I'll let you
take a look behind you...

749
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:00,104
<i>T-This hole...!</i>

750
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:02,982
You saw it too, didn't you...?

751
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:08,070
That hole is the hole Naruto
burrowed and flew out of.

752
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:13,326
So it's connected to the
big hole in front of you.

753
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:19,415
I didn't expect that...
a shadow in a tunnel of a hole...

754
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:21,667
Right.

755
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:24,921
<i>The attack that he used
with the jacket,</i>

756
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:28,841
<i>was it a device to lead me
to right this spot...?</i>

757
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:31,886
<i>Was that an underplot too?!</i>

758
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:35,263
<i>Why that?!</i>

759
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:38,184
Checkmate with the next one.

760
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:50,029
<i>My body is moving on its own!
I can't resist it!</i>

761
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:59,163
Before anyone knew it,
they fell under the spell of this match.

762
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:02,959
That guy with no mark
is quite a darkhorse.

763
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:06,355
Yes! You did it!

764
01:06:06,531 --> 01:06:09,117
Go! Shikamaru!

765
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:34,782
Good grief...I give up!

766
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:45,251
What?!

767
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:53,634
See I told you...he'd give up.

768
01:06:54,927 --> 01:06:58,597
Ino doesn't know anything
about Shikamaru.

769
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:00,933
W-What did you say?!

770
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:08,315
I've used too much chakra from Shadow
Possession Jutsu in rapid succession.

771
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:10,342
I can't hold it another 10 seconds.

772
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:16,490
I thought of the
next trick 200 times.

773
01:07:17,241 --> 01:07:19,118
But I'm out of time...

774
01:07:23,622 --> 01:07:25,499
This has become such a pain.

775
01:07:25,786 --> 01:07:27,413
Doing one match is good...

776
01:07:28,652 --> 01:07:30,070
<i>That guy is a strange one.</i>

777
01:07:31,431 --> 01:07:33,350
The winner is Temari!

778
01:07:39,263 --> 01:07:41,432
Oh, I'm tired...

779
01:07:46,386 --> 01:07:49,013
Oh, what a waste!

780
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:53,486
Why?! He had a chance to
become a chunin!

781
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,113
Shikamaru is Shikamaru...

782
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:03,788
Really...Does he or doesn't he
have the motivation?

783
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:08,000
Even I'm not sure about it.

784
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:14,340
<i>But his intelligence and strategies
are no longer at the genin level.</i>

785
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:20,513
<i>If it had been an actual mission
for a basic platoon,</i>

786
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:24,850
<i>the win was decided when
he captured Temari...</i>

787
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:29,730
<i>So, I suppose he won the competition,
but he lost the match...</i>

788
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:33,526
In order to evaluate someone
as a leader of a platoon...

789
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:36,420
it's much more important to
protect the platoon from danger,

790
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:40,282
than to carry out a mission.

791
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:43,828
Yeah...it'd hardly be worth mentioning
a completed mission

792
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:46,413
if everyone was annihilated.

793
01:08:46,957 --> 01:08:49,209
The risks and the mission
should be put on a scale,

794
01:08:49,248 --> 01:08:52,626
surviving should be thought of first,
and then action should be taken.

795
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:55,110
A person who can't do this isn't
qualified to become a chunin.

796
01:08:55,339 --> 01:08:59,093
Hyuga and Naruto from earlier
fail on that point.

797
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:03,430
Well, I do feel like Shikamaru
gave up too soon too.

798
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:08,143
What do you think?

799
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:10,980
What do I feel...?

800
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:15,359
He has more of a chance
than Naruto, for sure!

801
01:09:15,442 --> 01:09:17,027
This ticks me off!

802
01:09:17,778 --> 01:09:20,573
I'm gonna really give him
a lecture!

803
01:09:21,448 --> 01:09:24,201
So the one that's gonna
become a chunin is...

804
01:09:25,786 --> 01:09:26,996
You idiot!

805
01:09:27,563 --> 01:09:29,313
Shut up, super idiot!

806
01:09:29,511 --> 01:09:33,379
Why the heck did you give up?!

807
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:36,714
Let's not talk about that anymore,
all right?

808
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:40,716
It's not all right! It was a match
you were close to winning!

809
01:09:40,741 --> 01:09:44,780
- Let's just watch the next match.
- But you just gave up! Unimaginable!

810
01:09:44,805 --> 01:09:46,682
Simply unimaginable!

811
01:09:47,224 --> 01:09:48,767
Huh? The next match?

812
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:55,356
Sasuke...!

813
01:09:57,776 --> 01:10:00,529
I hear Uchiha's gonna
withdraw from this match.

814
01:10:00,699 --> 01:10:01,908
Really?!

815
01:10:02,114 --> 01:10:03,782
I'm counting on you, come on!

816
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:08,078
As you'd expect, this match
will be won by Uchiha.

817
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:13,083
No way, I've got high hope
for the new one of the Sand.

818
01:10:13,334 --> 01:10:15,794
He won't let this one slip by.

819
01:10:18,172 --> 01:10:21,425
Lord Hokage, about Uchiha Sasuke,

820
01:10:21,774 --> 01:10:23,942
he has not yet arrived at the arena.

821
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:27,598
Umm...it's unavoidable...

822
01:10:28,432 --> 01:10:31,060
Why don't we wait just
another ten minutes?

823
01:10:31,467 --> 01:10:32,467
But...

824
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:36,732
The guests are looking forward
to the next match above all else.

825
01:10:37,838 --> 01:10:40,132
Cancelling it would be cruel.

826
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:44,698
Since it's come to this,
waiting another ten minutes wouldn't hurt.

827
01:10:44,823 --> 01:10:48,452
There is some truth to what
Kazekage says.

828
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:51,538
So...let Genma know of this.

829
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:53,665
Yes!

830
01:10:58,003 --> 01:11:01,131
<i>I see...a ten minute extension...</i>

831
01:11:06,887 --> 01:11:07,887
<i>Sasuke...</i>

832
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:15,980
Hey, isn't that...

833
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:28,993
But, what's that idiot doing
He's still not here?!

834
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:31,495
Good of the two of you to make it!

835
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:33,789
Come now, hurry into the arena!

836
01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:38,177
Yeah!

837
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:41,922
All right! Here we go!

838
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:43,173
Oh! Yeah!

839
01:11:44,049 --> 01:11:46,302
Most of the first round is finished,

840
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:49,484
and the only one left is
Sasuke Uchiha and Gaara.

841
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:52,433
H-How about Naruto and
Neji's match?!

842
01:11:53,261 --> 01:11:55,221
Well, the interesting thing is...

843
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:57,521
Hyuga lost...

844
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:08,198
<i>Naruto beat Neji...</i>

845
01:12:12,911 --> 01:12:13,911
I see...

846
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,040
<i>You did it!</i>

847
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:19,459
<i>Naruto!</i>

848
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:23,422
<i>You're such a...
good guy really...</i>

849
01:12:24,490 --> 01:12:26,859
- What's going on with the next match!
- Let's get on with it!

850
01:12:26,884 --> 01:12:28,552
Isn't Uchiha up yet?!

851
01:12:28,577 --> 01:12:30,537
We want Uchiha! Uchiha!

852
01:12:30,804 --> 01:12:32,014
Uchiha!

853
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,060
Hey, it's almost time.

854
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:38,395
Is he really gonna come?!

855
01:12:39,646 --> 01:12:40,646
He'll come...

856
01:12:42,365 --> 01:12:43,825
He'll definitely come!

857
01:13:08,171 --> 01:13:10,549
Sorry we're late!

858
01:13:13,722 --> 01:13:14,591
Your name?

859
01:13:15,599 --> 01:13:17,601
Sasuke...Uchiha.

860
01:13:18,143 --> 01:13:19,186
Sasuke…

861
01:13:21,009 --> 01:13:22,844
You're really late!

862
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:26,944
I thought you chickened out
and weren't coming!

863
01:13:28,612 --> 01:13:32,074
It's too early to celebrate,
you loser.

864
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:35,452
Judging from that smirk
on your face,

865
01:13:35,477 --> 01:13:37,270
I guess you won your first match?

866
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:38,705
Damn right!

867
01:13:39,164 --> 01:13:43,210
Oh well, we made such
a grand entrance.

868
01:13:44,128 --> 01:13:47,423
Sasuke hasn't been disqualified, has he?

869
01:13:48,048 --> 01:13:51,760
Not at all. We pushed
Sasuke's match until later.

870
01:13:52,469 --> 01:13:54,054
He's not disqualified.

871
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:57,891
That's good news. I'm glad!

872
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:09,027
Don't lose to someone like that!

873
01:14:10,028 --> 01:14:11,029
I know...

874
01:14:16,565 --> 01:14:18,692
<i>I want to fight you too.</i>

875
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:21,790
Sasuke!

876
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:24,376
I want to fight you too.

877
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:26,628
Yeah...

878
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:34,011
Yay, Sasuke!

879
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:35,637
Uchiha's match is gonna start!

880
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:38,432
<i>Shikamaru gave it so much,
but already it's Sasuke...</i>

881
01:14:38,682 --> 01:14:40,476
<i>Poor Shikamaru...</i>

882
01:14:41,393 --> 01:14:42,769
Hey, is that Uchiha?

883
01:14:43,395 --> 01:14:45,814
<i>I'm just second fiddle...</i>

884
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:48,775
<i>Well, I guess that's just
the way it goes...</i>

885
01:14:49,776 --> 01:14:51,528
<i>I'm looking forward to it too.</i>

886
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:56,366
Your team is sort of amazing, Sakura.

887
01:14:56,950 --> 01:14:57,743
What is?

888
01:14:57,951 --> 01:15:02,164
Well, Naruto did beat that
Neji Hyuga and...

889
01:15:02,789 --> 01:15:04,833
Sasuke is an elite member
of the Uchiha...

890
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:09,671
and it seems like everyone's
anxious to see Sasuke's match.

891
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:16,678
<i>Sasuke will face that Gaara
of the Sand whom I couldn't beat...</i>

892
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:22,309
<i>And Naruto beat that Neji
that I had hoped to take down.</i>

893
01:15:27,898 --> 01:15:28,899
<i>Why is it so...</i>

894
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:31,360
<i>Why am I so...</i>

895
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:34,738
<i>frustrated!</i>

896
01:15:37,157 --> 01:15:38,157
<i>Lee...!</i>

897
01:15:42,829 --> 01:15:43,914
<i>At last...</i>

898
01:15:47,918 --> 01:15:49,920
Gaara, come down here!

899
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:52,673
Naruto! Let's go up!

900
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,215
Yeah!

901
01:15:57,261 --> 01:16:00,097
When we go up,
we'll leisurely take the stairs.

902
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:01,557
What's up with you!

903
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,892
Are you still upset that
I pushed you down?!

904
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:12,900
<i>T-This isn't good...</i>

905
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:16,020
<i>It's been quite awhile
since I've seen Gaara like this.</i>

906
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:18,240
H-Hey...Gaara.

907
01:16:18,865 --> 01:16:20,409
Keep the strategy in mind...!

908
01:16:28,331 --> 01:16:30,124
Don't talk to Gaara right now!

909
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:34,088
You'll be killed.

910
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:39,650
Right!

911
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:41,721
Let's go

912
01:16:44,808 --> 01:16:46,643
Hey, hurry up!

913
01:16:47,096 --> 01:16:49,938
Nothing good's gonna happen
in your life if you panic.

914
01:16:52,232 --> 01:16:53,232
What's wrong?

915
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:55,269
Huh?

916
01:17:03,457 --> 01:17:07,544
Low level tournaments like this
Chunin Examination are ideal

917
01:17:07,855 --> 01:17:10,135
as gambling matches.

918
01:17:10,584 --> 01:17:14,046
A number of feudal lords
are here for that purpose.

919
01:17:14,671 --> 01:17:18,300
So...
would you lose this match for us.

920
01:18:48,671 --> 01:18:50,798
If those two in front of us
hadn't been there,

921
01:18:51,476 --> 01:18:53,353
we probably would've been killed...

922
01:18:54,358 --> 01:18:58,320
This is the first I've seen anyone kill
people without hesitation like that...

923
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:01,319
This isn't looking good
even for Sasuke.

924
01:19:03,196 --> 01:19:04,196
<i>Sasuke...</i>

925
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:16,501
The rules are the same as
in the preliminaries.

926
01:19:17,461 --> 01:19:21,089
The match goes on until one of you
dies or admits defeat.

927
01:19:22,399 --> 01:19:24,609
When it's determined that
there's a winner,

928
01:19:24,801 --> 01:19:26,720
the match can be stopped.

929
01:19:27,637 --> 01:19:29,181
But that's my decision.

930
01:19:43,403 --> 01:19:45,781
Hey Guy! You too, Lee...

931
01:19:46,714 --> 01:19:48,298
Is your body all right?

932
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:50,247
Kakashi!

933
01:19:50,655 --> 01:19:51,744
Kakashi Sensei!

934
01:19:54,090 --> 01:19:56,300
Oh! Sorry, sorry.

935
01:19:56,990 --> 01:20:01,268
You must've been worried.
Sorry for not contacting you at all...

936
01:20:02,422 --> 01:20:05,383
<i>Oh no,
Sakura's gonna get really mad...</i>

937
01:20:09,433 --> 01:20:11,852
I don't really mind that.

938
01:20:14,599 --> 01:20:15,599
Kakashi Sensei...

939
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:17,407
Hm?

940
01:20:18,839 --> 01:20:22,474
You know about the mark
on Sasuke's neck, don't you?

941
01:20:25,445 --> 01:20:26,736
No need to worry.

942
01:20:29,064 --> 01:20:31,066
So, that's that.

943
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:32,831
Yup!

944
01:20:36,998 --> 01:20:37,998
<i>Eight of them...</i>

945
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:41,807
<i>There are eight members of
ANBU Black Ops in this spacious arena...</i>

946
01:20:42,045 --> 01:20:43,547
<i>Two platoons are too few...</i>

947
01:20:45,173 --> 01:20:46,758
What's Lord Hokage thinking?

948
01:20:47,801 --> 01:20:51,263
Well...without knowing how or when
the opponent would make their move...

949
01:20:51,763 --> 01:20:54,850
It can't be helped that the ANBU
are dispersed and deployed

950
01:20:54,915 --> 01:20:56,875
in important areas in the village.

951
01:20:57,602 --> 01:20:58,602
Huh?

952
01:20:58,854 --> 01:20:59,854
It's about to begin.

953
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:02,607
We shouldn't let our guard down,
but for now...

954
01:21:03,066 --> 01:21:06,111
We need to pay attention...
to this match.

955
01:21:10,065 --> 01:21:15,821
Kakashi, I'll be carefully checking out
what sort of training you gave him...

956
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:19,040
as your eternal rival!

957
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:23,879
Huh? Did you say something

958
01:21:43,982 --> 01:21:44,722
Begin!

959
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:54,784
<i>So this is the sand
Kakashi told me about...</i>

960
01:22:01,876 --> 01:22:04,713
Please don't get so mad...

961
01:22:07,797 --> 01:22:09,132
Mother...

962
01:22:11,509 --> 01:22:13,929
<i>What's he talking about...?</i>

963
01:22:15,555 --> 01:22:21,144
Earlier...Earlier I had you suck
awful tasting blood.

964
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:23,813
I'm sorry.

965
01:22:25,482 --> 01:22:29,361
But this time it'll likely...

966
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:31,655
taste good.

967
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:41,581
It appears he's calmed down.

968
01:22:49,089 --> 01:22:50,089
Come on.

969
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:42,976
<i>He's fast! It's nearly the same
as Lee's ordinary speed.</i>

970
01:23:43,601 --> 01:23:44,601
<i>And...</i>

971
01:23:45,145 --> 01:23:46,938
<i>It's overlapping with the image...</i>

972
01:23:48,481 --> 01:23:49,482
<i>of my taijutsu!</i>

973
01:23:54,237 --> 01:23:55,822
Is that the Sand Armor?

974
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:01,160
Come on!

975
01:24:02,078 --> 01:24:04,205
If you're not gonna come at me,
I'll go at you!

976
01:24:16,426 --> 01:24:19,304
What's the matter? Is that it?

977
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:27,187
<i>A-Amazing...</i>

978
01:24:31,816 --> 01:24:34,569
That armor...I'll tear it off.

979
01:24:42,619 --> 01:24:46,539
<i>His speed is basically the same
as Lee's with the weights removed.</i>

980
01:25:05,683 --> 01:25:07,936
What the heck sort of training
did you do?!

981
01:25:08,353 --> 01:25:08,983
Hm?

982
01:25:09,687 --> 01:25:12,357
To get to that level
in a mere month...

983
01:25:13,744 --> 01:25:17,247
Sasuke had copied Lee's taijutsu
with Sharingan.

984
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:21,032
So during the taijutsu training...

985
01:25:21,399 --> 01:25:24,026
I had Sasuke image Lee's movements.

986
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:29,549
Sasuke could make
that movement his own

987
01:25:29,874 --> 01:25:31,793
only because he knew Lee.

988
01:25:32,877 --> 01:25:35,755
Of course, Sasuke had to
work very hard for it.

989
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:37,465
<i>He must have seen the battle</i>

990
01:25:37,553 --> 01:25:40,097
<i>between the hateful Gaara
and the lovable Lee.</i>

991
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:43,532
<i>Why is it that he had Sasuke
master only taijutsu?!</i>

992
01:26:01,114 --> 01:26:04,951
<i>Why did I keep living?</i>

993
01:26:07,453 --> 01:26:10,790
<i>But as long as you're alive,
you need a reason...</i>

994
01:26:11,291 --> 01:26:13,835
<i>If you don't have one,
it's just the same as being dead.</i>

995
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:16,880
<i>What's this guy saying?!</i>

996
01:26:21,301 --> 01:26:23,636
<i>So this is the answer I came to...</i>

997
01:26:24,304 --> 01:26:28,266
<i>I am living in order to kill
human beings other than myself.</i>

998
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:32,270
<i>After living in the fear of never
knowing when I might be murdered,</i>

999
01:26:32,478 --> 01:26:34,314
<i>finally, I became calm.</i>

1000
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:36,913
Oh?

1001
01:26:37,609 --> 01:26:38,609
Shikamaru...

1002
01:26:39,132 --> 01:26:41,965
We need to go over to where
Kakashi Sensei is right now!

1003
01:26:43,072 --> 01:26:44,407
What're you planning to do?

1004
01:26:44,949 --> 01:26:45,949
Hey!

1005
01:26:47,827 --> 01:26:49,037
I'm going to...

1006
01:26:50,079 --> 01:26:51,079
stop this match!

1007
01:27:27,283 --> 01:27:29,827
<i>So he used all the sand
for protection...</i>

1008
01:27:30,745 --> 01:27:32,681
<i>I didn't think there could be this
much of a difference in the hardness</i>

1009
01:27:32,706 --> 01:27:34,708
<i>with a difference in the density
of the sand.</i>

1010
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:42,966
So it's absolute protection.

1011
01:27:45,301 --> 01:27:46,886
Kakashi Sensei!

1012
01:27:50,848 --> 01:27:51,848
Naruto!

1013
01:27:55,436 --> 01:27:57,689
Huh? What do you want?

1014
01:27:58,356 --> 01:28:01,609
Sensei!
Please stop this match right away!

1015
01:28:04,529 --> 01:28:08,408
That guy is totally different from us!

1016
01:28:08,866 --> 01:28:10,868
He's not normal!

1017
01:28:11,494 --> 01:28:15,373
Naruto...
What're you saying?

1018
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:18,710
He lives to kill people.

1019
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,044
In any case...

1020
01:28:20,503 --> 01:28:23,298
If this continues, Sasuke will die!

1021
01:28:26,634 --> 01:28:28,720
There's nothing to worry about...

1022
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:29,615
What?

1023
01:28:30,179 --> 01:28:31,514
Sasuke and I...

1024
01:28:33,266 --> 01:28:35,643
We didn't just get here late
for no reason.

1025
01:28:36,894 --> 01:28:38,396
<i>Withdrawing like that...</i>

1026
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:42,108
<i>I don't know what you're up to...</i>

1027
01:28:43,359 --> 01:28:44,652
<i>but the timing is perfect.</i>

1028
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:50,325
<i>This thing of mine also takes time!</i>

1029
01:28:53,853 --> 01:28:54,520
Sensei...

1030
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:55,628
Hm?

1031
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:59,667
What do you mean
you didn't get here late for nothing?

1032
01:29:00,626 --> 01:29:02,170
Hmm...

1033
01:29:03,011 --> 01:29:03,963
You want to know why?

1034
01:29:04,088 --> 01:29:07,258
Like I said, this isn't the time
to be talking about that!

1035
01:29:07,825 --> 01:29:09,294
Shut up and watch him.

1036
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:17,810
'Cause you'll get a real surprise.

1037
01:29:32,533 --> 01:29:33,533
<i>That idiot...</i>

1038
01:29:34,077 --> 01:29:38,956
<i>Gaara...we never know when
the signal is going to come!</i>

1039
01:29:40,541 --> 01:29:43,419
<i>Yeah...
I'm gonna tear him open.</i>

1040
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:48,091
<i>That's how it comes out.
What?</i>

1041
01:29:48,966 --> 01:29:50,510
<i>The contents...</i>

1042
01:29:51,165 --> 01:29:53,667
<i>Lots and lots are coming out, right?</i>

1043
01:29:55,556 --> 01:29:57,350
<i>I'll give it all to you.</i>

1044
01:29:59,268 --> 01:30:01,896
<i>I'm always a good boy!</i>

1045
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:04,732
<i>Yeah, let's do it.</i>

1046
01:30:05,733 --> 01:30:09,153
<i>Mother, I'm watching so...</i>

1047
01:30:12,433 --> 01:30:16,011
Damn! He's totally useless,
no matter what we do now.

1048
01:30:17,108 --> 01:30:18,485
He's not even
abiding by the plan.

1049
01:30:18,621 --> 01:30:20,541
He looks like he's just going
to screw things up!

1050
01:30:20,748 --> 01:30:21,999
That Gaara!

1051
01:30:23,835 --> 01:30:27,463
<i>Hey, hey, wouldn't it
be better if we flee...?</i>

1052
01:30:32,176 --> 01:30:33,176
<i>Plan?</i>

1053
01:30:40,518 --> 01:30:42,019
D-Don't tell me that...

1054
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:46,274
The reason I decided to
train Sasuke was...

1055
01:30:48,234 --> 01:30:51,946
because he was like me.

1056
01:31:08,212 --> 01:31:09,839
A physical Activation?!

1057
01:31:10,715 --> 01:31:11,715
I see...

1058
01:31:12,008 --> 01:31:13,968
That's why he went through
the physical training

1059
01:31:14,385 --> 01:31:16,762
and increased
his speed significantly...!

1060
01:31:18,139 --> 01:31:19,139
That's right!

1061
01:31:24,645 --> 01:31:25,645
Awesome...

1062
01:31:26,022 --> 01:31:27,942
The chakra is clearly visible
to the naked eye...

1063
01:31:28,524 --> 01:31:30,067
What in the world is happening?!

1064
01:31:31,986 --> 01:31:33,706
<i>Don't tell me that
he learned that jutsu...!</i>

1065
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:37,700
<i>So this is the Uchiha Clan...</i>

1066
01:31:45,458 --> 01:31:46,667
<i>Exactly...</i>

1067
01:31:47,376 --> 01:31:49,712
W-What the heck is that?!

1068
01:31:50,671 --> 01:31:53,341
What a sound!
What's that technique?

1069
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:55,301
That's just a jab...

1070
01:31:55,885 --> 01:31:56,885
Huh?!

1071
01:31:57,905 --> 01:32:00,908
However, it is the one used by
Leaf Villages! Number one technician.

1072
01:32:01,307 --> 01:32:04,852
That's the only original technique
of the Copy ninja, Kakashi...

1073
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:09,440
It's the special technique
used for assassinations...

1074
01:32:10,274 --> 01:32:12,527
Its secret is in the speed of the jab,

1075
01:32:12,818 --> 01:32:15,530
and also the physical aptitude
that gives forth a gigantic chakra,

1076
01:32:16,322 --> 01:32:19,033
the ability of the chakra to
focus solely on the target,

1077
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:23,246
and moreover the speed of
the jab makes a chichichichichi sound...

1078
01:32:23,371 --> 01:32:27,875
A unique sound attack similar
to the rumbling of a thousand birds.

1079
01:32:32,728 --> 01:32:36,217
And that's why
that technique is called...

1080
01:32:39,929 --> 01:32:41,049
<i>Chidori: One Thousand Birds!</i>

1081
01:32:56,904 --> 01:33:00,700
No way!
That Gaara's absolute protection is...

1082
01:33:01,656 --> 01:33:02,826
It's impossible...

1083
01:33:04,245 --> 01:33:05,329
Don't tell me...

1084
01:33:06,318 --> 01:33:07,318
That's...

1085
01:33:08,291 --> 01:33:09,291
Kakashi's...

1086
01:33:11,420 --> 01:33:14,382
Chidori...
Also known as Lightning Blade.

1087
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:17,090
Lightning Blade?

1088
01:33:18,234 --> 01:33:21,362
Lightning Blade is another name
for the jutsu derived

1089
01:33:21,470 --> 01:33:24,849
from Kakashi's ability to cut through
lightning using that technique.

1090
01:33:25,566 --> 01:33:27,693
<i>Huh? Cut through lightning?</i>

1091
01:33:28,563 --> 01:33:31,816
<i>Huh? That sounds fishy...</i>

1092
01:33:32,133 --> 01:33:33,820
<i>A-Awesome...</i>

1093
01:33:34,275 --> 01:33:37,069
The real name of that technique
is Chidori...

1094
01:33:37,724 --> 01:33:42,104
The secret is the speed of his jab
that surpasses any human limitations

1095
01:33:42,781 --> 01:33:44,992
and the intensity of
the chakra on his arm...

1096
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:49,707
And that arm virtually turns into
the equivalent of the swing

1097
01:33:49,732 --> 01:33:52,110
of a celebrated sword that
cuts through everything.

1098
01:33:54,128 --> 01:33:56,756
But what a reckless technique...

1099
01:33:57,298 --> 01:33:58,883
That's not for you to say...

1100
01:33:59,508 --> 01:34:00,885
Right, Lee?

1101
01:34:03,648 --> 01:34:06,614
<i>The guy who was worrying about
Sasuke until just a moment ago...</i>

1102
01:34:09,143 --> 01:34:11,479
<i>is now jealous of him.</i>

1103
01:34:22,337 --> 01:34:25,591
What...? This warm thing...?

1104
01:34:27,203 --> 01:34:30,414
Mother...? What is...?

1105
01:34:42,259 --> 01:34:46,597
Blood!
My blood is...!

1106
01:34:47,723 --> 01:34:48,933
D-Don't tell me that...

1107
01:35:01,529 --> 01:35:04,281
<i>D-Don't tell me that
Gaara is hurt?!</i>

1108
01:35:13,958 --> 01:35:14,958
What is that?!

1109
01:35:15,959 --> 01:35:17,294
<i>It's that thing's arm!</i>

1110
01:35:25,302 --> 01:35:27,763
Damn! Doing something
careless like that...

1111
01:35:33,117 --> 01:35:34,785
Has the Perfect Possession happened?

1112
01:35:35,271 --> 01:35:38,441
I don't know.
He seems to be injured...

1113
01:35:38,649 --> 01:35:40,067
This has never happened before.

1114
01:35:45,156 --> 01:35:47,283
<i>It gives me the chills
just to remember...</i>

1115
01:35:47,992 --> 01:35:51,787
<i>When I first saw that thing,
I wasn't able to eat...</i>

1116
01:35:53,330 --> 01:35:56,333
<i>I mean, visually it's totally...</i>

1117
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:37,666
<i>What is...</i>

1118
01:36:38,667 --> 01:36:40,002
<i>this sensation?</i>

1119
01:37:19,166 --> 01:37:20,626
He's hurt, after all...

1120
01:37:21,710 --> 01:37:23,796
The shell was broken when
his body was incomplete!

1121
01:37:34,431 --> 01:37:36,851
<i>It's different! Those aren't the eyes!</i>

1122
01:37:37,768 --> 01:37:40,354
<i>W-What was that...
that look earlier on?!</i>

1123
01:38:09,049 --> 01:38:09,738
Huh?

1124
01:38:22,646 --> 01:38:27,276
What's this...? I can't see...

1125
01:38:27,943 --> 01:38:29,361
Kakashi! This must be!

1126
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:31,238
Yeah...genjutsu!

1127
01:38:33,032 --> 01:38:34,032
<i>- Release!
- Release!</i>

1128
01:38:44,376 --> 01:38:45,376
<i>Release!</i>

1129
01:38:46,037 --> 01:38:49,916
<i>Genjutsu!
Is Kabuto already moving?</i>

1130
01:38:51,383 --> 01:38:53,677
<i>In that case,
it's just about time...</i>

1131
01:38:59,019 --> 01:38:59,764
<i>It's coming!</i>

1132
01:39:15,415 --> 01:39:16,254
Shall we begin?!

1133
01:39:28,545 --> 01:39:29,545
It's the signal!

1134
01:39:46,772 --> 01:39:48,532
<i>- Start the operation!
- Start the operation!</i>
