1
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:33,301
Okay! Let's go!

2
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,599
Huh?

3
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,316
"Let's go,"
with so much energy...

4
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,485
Don't act like a little kid!

5
00:01:51,085 --> 00:01:53,379
Oh? You're in a bad mood.

6
00:01:53,771 --> 00:01:56,649
Because! Because!
It's in the middle of my training!

7
00:01:56,779 --> 00:01:58,907
There are three steps
in the training, right?!

8
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:02,580
I'm only done with the second step!

9
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:07,252
You can do the third step
even while walking.

10
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,254
What! Really?!

11
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:14,758
A balloon?

12
00:02:15,274 --> 00:02:16,093
Here!

13
00:02:22,253 --> 00:02:25,047
What's this...?
An ordinary balloon?

14
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:32,193
The first step is "Spin."
The second step is "Power."

15
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:38,366
And finally, the third step is this.

16
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,974
Which one is "this"?!

17
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,341
Watch me, it looks as if
I am simply holding a balloon...

18
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:12,817
You say it "looks as if,"
but nothing is really happening.

19
00:03:13,022 --> 00:03:16,985
Then, I will do the same thing
on my left hand.

20
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:22,285
Let's see what's really happening
inside the balloon.

21
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:27,630
<i>Wow!</i>

22
00:03:27,902 --> 00:03:30,655
<i>The chakra is randomly spinning
and going faster and faster...</i>

23
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:35,048
<i>But still, it's perfectly round...
It's almost like...</i>

24
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,842
Like a small typhoon, right?

25
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,597
What's happening in your left hand...

26
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,171
is happening inside that balloon
in your right hand, too?

27
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,269
Yeah! That's right.

28
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,564
<i>Cool...</i>

29
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:58,071
<i>The balloon isn't moving at all
even if he's spinning that much chakra...</i>

30
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,658
<i>There's more power than
that time the rubber ball popped,</i>

31
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,660
<i>and it's spinning a lot more too!</i>

32
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,654
Listen, in this third step,

33
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:09,474
you've got to use 100% of
what you have learned...

34
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,125
and retain them.

35
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:18,549
In other words, while keeping
the "Spin" and the "Power" at their max,

36
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:22,480
imagine creating a single layer
within the balloon

37
00:04:22,701 --> 00:04:25,412
and compressing the chakra within it.

38
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,271
Got it!

39
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,539
So, this training is about keeping

40
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,650
the spin and power that I did
in the second step,

41
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:38,695
and conversely,
trying not to pop a delicate balloon!

42
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:42,366
Oh! That's the most perceptive
you've been so far!

43
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:44,908
Huh?

44
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:49,173
But, what's the point in going
to all the trouble?!

45
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,626
In short, it means this.

46
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:59,299
Watch! It's like this up until
the second step of the training.

47
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:14,647
Next, after you have mastered
the third step!

48
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,073
This is what happens!

49
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:46,846
If you can keep this small typhoon
the size of your palm,

50
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,637
the force won't disperse.

51
00:05:48,871 --> 00:05:51,081
The spinning gets faster and faster

52
00:05:51,212 --> 00:05:53,214
and the power gets
more and more compressed.

53
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:58,107
And the destructive power
will reach its max.

54
00:06:01,105 --> 00:06:02,732
Well, so, that's that.

55
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:10,102
<i>All right! I'll do this, too!</i>

56
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:30,014
<i>Okay, this feels right...</i>

57
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,229
<i>Now!</i>

58
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,607
<i>Retain it here!</i>

59
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,443
<i>Retain...</i>

60
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,661
<i>Retain...</i>

61
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,543
No cutting-corners!

62
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:02,672
You've got to put out 100% spin and power,
and retain them.

63
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,298
<i>You gotta be kidding...</i>

64
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:09,887
<i>Unless I can perfectly control all my powe
it's impossible!</i>

65
00:07:13,492 --> 00:07:14,910
<i>Now I can see it...</i>

66
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:17,205
<i>This third step...</i>

67
00:07:17,972 --> 00:07:20,349
<i>It's on a totally different level
compared to the others.</i>

68
00:07:20,695 --> 00:07:22,030
I told you...

69
00:07:22,248 --> 00:07:26,502
With an achievement difficulty of Rank A,
it's a super advanced ninjutsu.

70
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:33,536
Well, I'm done explaining!
We'll continue as we go on walking.

71
00:07:35,277 --> 00:07:36,862
Hey, hey!

72
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:40,001
We don't need to rush so much,
until I can properly...

73
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:43,838
We have already wasted enough time
waiting for your body to recover.

74
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:49,343
There's no guarantee that
Tsunade stays in this town much longer.

75
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,028
What?!

76
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,388
But, but...

77
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:55,308
It's not like an old acquaintance
is going to conveniently pop up

78
00:07:55,651 --> 00:07:58,362
and start talking about
the good old times with her...

79
00:07:58,895 --> 00:07:59,980
Come on, let's go!

80
00:08:00,557 --> 00:08:01,766
All right...

81
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:43,689
Long time no see...Orochimaru.

82
00:08:45,354 --> 00:08:48,065
I'd looked for you everywhere.

83
00:08:48,463 --> 00:08:50,966
What do you want from me
after so long a time?

84
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:54,124
You aren't thinking of talking
about the old days...?

85
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:58,996
Actually, I need to ask you
for a little favor...

86
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,091
<i>His heartbeat is fast...</i>

87
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,794
<i>From that complexion,
he must have a high fever.</i>

88
00:09:05,181 --> 00:09:07,101
<i>He must have been fatigued
for quite some time...</i>

89
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,106
<i>And that arm...</i>

90
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,385
Lady Tsunade.

91
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,931
You must have understood by now.

92
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:21,227
Go to someone else,
I don't treat anyone any more.

93
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,145
That won't do...

94
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,857
You must know how serious
this wound is...

95
00:09:27,756 --> 00:09:29,925
No one can treat this wound.

96
00:09:31,546 --> 00:09:33,923
Except for one of the Legendary Sannin

97
00:09:34,368 --> 00:09:37,413
who won her fame as
a medical specialist, Princess Tsunade...

98
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,161
You...

99
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,336
That arm...
it's not an ordinary wound.

100
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,009
<i>A special Sealing Jutsu or something...?</i>

101
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,845
What have you done?

102
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:01,434
Well, it just happened...
when I killed the Third Hokage.

103
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:07,273
You...Really?

104
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:12,695
Humph. Don't look so scary.

105
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,616
Anything that has a form
will one day decay...

106
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,993
Same goes for humans.

107
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,788
You must already know that too.

108
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:34,967
For you have let two of
your most beloved ones die...

109
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:43,059
That was a really terrible way to die...

110
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,351
You!

111
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:56,072
Poisoned...

112
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,241
<i>She's fast!</i>

113
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,326
Get out of my way!

114
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,788
Calm down, Shizune!

115
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,382
<i>This attendant...is an expert.</i>

116
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,727
Orochimaru...

117
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:30,690
Your personality's been like this
for a long time.

118
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,695
And you know my personality
very well...

119
00:11:36,084 --> 00:11:38,169
So stop fooling around with me.

120
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,005
I'll kill you, bastard!

121
00:11:57,753 --> 00:12:00,130
We didn't come here to fight.

122
00:12:00,955 --> 00:12:02,665
We just want to negotiate with you!

123
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,684
I've already told you once.
Get out of my sight!

124
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:10,730
You are the only one
who can treat Lord Orochimaru's arm.

125
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,522
Get out of my sight.

126
00:12:13,264 --> 00:12:14,932
We're not asking you to do it for free.

127
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,527
Let's make a deal!

128
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,573
I'll count up to five.
Leave before I'm done.

129
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:26,162
Or else, I'll make you disappear myself.

130
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:30,583
Please calm down.
It won't be a bad deal for you...

131
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:31,624
Five...

132
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:34,669
Four...

133
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:38,923
Three...

134
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,218
Two...

135
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:45,930
One...

136
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:52,605
I'll resurrect the little brother
and man, both of whom you loved...

137
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:57,109
with the Forbidden Jutsu I've developed.

138
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,422
Since we haven't disappeared yet,

139
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:23,928
I'm guessing that the deal is made?

140
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:32,561
Don't you want to see those two...
Tsunade?

141
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:44,406
If I treat your arms,
what do you intend to do with them?

142
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:52,623
Well, I don't like to lie...

143
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,877
So, I will tell you the truth.

144
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:02,341
In addition to getting what I want...

145
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:08,848
This time, I will completely destroy
the Leaf Village!

146
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,062
And your answer is?

147
00:14:19,632 --> 00:14:22,510
No! You must not believe
in their sweet talk...

148
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:27,349
Your brother and my uncle
wouldn't want any of that!

149
00:14:36,747 --> 00:14:40,434
You don't have to answer right now.

150
00:14:41,565 --> 00:14:43,734
However, I want it in a week.

151
00:14:44,736 --> 00:14:48,281
Also, two human sacrifices are needed
for this Forbidden Jutsu,

152
00:14:49,047 --> 00:14:51,717
so do what you need to do
to prepare them.

153
00:14:52,228 --> 00:14:56,106
Lady Tsunade, let's kill them right here!
It's our chance!

154
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:59,315
With you and me, now we can...!

155
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:06,947
<i>Lady Tsunade...</i>

156
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,150
Sure, I am weak now.

157
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,484
However...

158
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,741
I also know Tsunade's weakness.

159
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,630
<i>So he knows that...</i>

160
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,456
I see it's not cured yet...

161
00:15:59,137 --> 00:16:01,264
your fear of blood.

162
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,297
<i>Hemophobia...?</i>

163
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,137
Shall we get going, Kabuto?

164
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:19,311
Tsunade...I'll be expecting
a favorable answer from you.

165
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:42,626
W-What the heck is going on here?

166
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:44,628
Hmm...

167
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,005
Help me!

168
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,675
Excuse me there, Mister!
Wait just a moment!

169
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,885
What in the world is happening?

170
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,971
You should run away too!

171
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,723
There's a monster up there!

172
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,808
A monster...?

173
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,894
What could it be?
This monster thing?!

174
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:05,774
It's a g-gigantic snake!
It destroyed the castle in a flash!

175
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,654
How big of a snake?!

176
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:13,507
Me too, at my village before...

177
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,035
I was attacked by a huge snake!

178
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,411
We must hurry, Naruto!

179
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:22,275
That snake is probably the same one
that you saw before.

180
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,509
Looks like we were a little too late...

181
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,499
Is this that snake's doing, too?!

182
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,390
- Let's go, Naruto!
- Huh?

183
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,142
Tsunade isn't here any more.

184
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:43,687
Geez, you keep telling me that...!

185
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,070
Heck, she's nowhere to be found!

186
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,444
Dragging me around here and there,

187
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,322
but after all,
we haven't found a single trace!

188
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,880
Hmm?

189
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,203
Well, let's dine here for now.

190
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,037
Huh?

191
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,248
Isn't this a pub?

192
00:18:03,793 --> 00:18:05,503
So what?

193
00:18:05,912 --> 00:18:09,958
I've told you so many times!
I'm still underage!

194
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:16,220
You fool. Nobody is asking you to drink.
Kids should only be eating snacks.

195
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,097
- Well then...
- Welcome!

196
00:18:18,122 --> 00:18:20,332
There's no need to dine here!

197
00:18:20,656 --> 00:18:22,134
We can go to a ramen noodle shop
or something!

198
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:26,647
How stupid! You can gather information
in this type of place...

199
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:34,737
<i>Huh?</i>

200
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,197
Huh?!

201
00:18:37,481 --> 00:18:38,816
Tsunade!

202
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,744
Jiraiya?!

203
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,580
Why...are you here?

204
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:47,709
I've finally found you!
I'm exhausted...

205
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,921
<i>That gal is Tsunade?!</i>

206
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,512
<i>She's 50 years old for real?</i>

207
00:18:59,617 --> 00:19:00,928
<i>Now, that's a swindle.</i>

208
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:10,107
<i>I can't believe...
I met two of the Sannin in one day.</i>

209
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:21,623
In any case...
Today is a day I see many old friends.

210
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,463
You mean Orochimaru...

211
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,092
What happened?

212
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:44,558
Nothing, really.
We exchanged a greeting.

213
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:04,203
<i>Is it really true that this gal
is the Kunoichi</i>

214
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,164
<i>who can heal any kind of wound?</i>

215
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:09,917
What about you?

216
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,252
What do you want from me?

217
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,674
I'll be straight with you.

218
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:29,436
Tsunade, the village bas demanded
that you become the Fifth Hokage

219
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:43,200
Hey, ol' man,
gimme the simmered meat with potatoes!

220
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,493
All right, in a moment.

221
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:51,291
<i>The Fifth Hokage?!
What's this out of the blue?!</i>

222
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,335
<i>What the heck is going on?!</i>

223
00:20:57,587 --> 00:20:59,506
Do you know about the Third Hokage!?

224
00:21:01,457 --> 00:21:05,127
<i>The Third Hokage?
So, he really was...</i>

225
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,730
Orochimaru did it, right?

226
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:17,819
I heard about it.
Directly from him.

227
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,612
<i>Orochimaru did it...?</i>

228
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:22,947
Orochimaru?!

229
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,242
Did he really killed the old man,
the Third Hokage?!

230
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,286
Who is this Orochimaru?!

231
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:32,124
Just like us, he's one of the Sannin.

232
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:36,211
Why?! The Sannin are all
from Leaf Village, right?

233
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:37,462
Then why?!

234
00:21:37,819 --> 00:21:39,636
Who's this brat?

235
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,054
He's Naruto Uzumaki.

236
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,099
Hey, you just hold it there!

237
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,894
I am not done talking yet!

238
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:57,441
This Orochimaru?!
This bastard that killed Old Man Hokage.

239
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,484
Who the heck is he?!

240
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:02,529
He's a legendary Sannin, right?!

241
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,614
Then knowing that...

242
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,743
why would you, Pervy Sage,
leave such a guy alone?!

243
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,221
Besides...

244
00:22:08,332 --> 00:22:10,834
What do you mean this person
is the Fifth Hokage?!

245
00:22:10,863 --> 00:22:13,157
Naruto, be quiet for a moment.

246
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:14,583
But...!

247
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,918
Just shut up!

248
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,682
Impossible...

249
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:33,934
I refuse!

250
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,981
I remember...those words.

251
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,653
You said those same words
when I asked you to go out with me.

252
00:22:45,184 --> 00:22:49,772
What the heck are you talking about?!
You said it yourself!

253
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,846
Didn't you say that
you will bring her back to the village

254
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,415
and have her treat Sasuke
and Kakashi Sensei?!

255
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,942
But what's this demand
for her to be the Hokage?!

256
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,835
And, on top of that, she refuses!

257
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,260
<i>Lady Tsunade...</i>

258
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,175
<i>Could she be thinking of making
a deal with Orochimaru?</i>

259
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:11,848
Calm down.

260
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:14,601
There can't be no other Fifth Hokage,
but this Tsunade.

261
00:23:16,711 --> 00:23:18,713
During the dreadful Great War Era,

262
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:21,483
she contributed tremendously
to the Leaf's victory.

263
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,196
To this date,

264
00:23:26,221 --> 00:23:30,016
there's no one who can rival
her combat and medical skills.

265
00:23:31,551 --> 00:23:34,888
Still more, this Tsunade is
the granddaughter of the First Hokage

266
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:36,998
So together with her talents,

267
00:23:37,023 --> 00:23:41,069
there's no one else more suited
to becoming the Fifth Hokage

268
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:44,047
If she becomes Hokage,

269
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,929
that means that
she'll come back to the village

270
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:51,415
And then, as I'd told you,
she can treat the two.

271
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:57,227
Besides, this is what the Leaf's
top decision-making advisors settled upon.

272
00:23:58,119 --> 00:24:02,832
Genin like you have no say
on this matter.

273
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,444
Jiraiya...

274
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,850
Unlike your previous apprentice,

275
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:13,170
this kid not only has a bad mouth and wit,
he's ugly to match.

276
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:14,493
What?!

277
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:18,582
It's tough on anyone to be
compared to the Fourth Hokage.

278
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:23,503
He had all the qualities to be
the greatest ninja in all history.

279
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,798
Brimming with talent in jutsu,
and he had a brilliant mind!

280
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:31,887
Popular with people and well...
he was as handsome as me.

281
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:35,515
But even that Fourth Hokage died quickly.

282
00:24:36,738 --> 00:24:40,158
Risking his own life for the village...

283
00:24:45,173 --> 00:24:46,716
Life is different from money...

284
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,409
To easily risk it and lose it,
is a fool's doing!

285
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,166
<i>Did she say "fool"?!</i>

286
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,920
Both my grandfather and the Second Hokage

287
00:25:05,127 --> 00:25:08,422
seemed to want to subdue
the disturbances of war above all else.

288
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,092
But after all, they died in vain,

289
00:25:11,467 --> 00:25:14,178
in the midst of their dreams
for the village.

290
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:19,376
You have changed, Tsunade...

291
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:23,021
I don't know what
you thought in your heart before,

292
00:25:23,202 --> 00:25:25,080
but to say such thing out loud...

293
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:30,403
Although I look young,
I'm already in my 50s...

294
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,757
Years change people.

295
00:25:40,323 --> 00:25:42,033
Same goes for Sarutobi Sensei...

296
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:47,170
No wonder he died showing off
at that old age!

297
00:26:09,425 --> 00:26:10,926
Hokage is a bother.

298
00:26:11,255 --> 00:26:13,299
No one but a fool would take it on.

299
00:26:17,048 --> 00:26:18,048
Why you?!

300
00:26:18,073 --> 00:26:20,409
- Let go of me!
- Don't! We're in a pub.

301
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,581
I said, let go of me!

302
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,415
<i>Lady Tsunade!</i>

303
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:30,338
Anyone who makes fun of the old man
and the Fourth Hokage...

304
00:26:30,369 --> 00:26:32,037
It doesn't matter if
you are a woman!

305
00:26:33,481 --> 00:26:35,841
I'll clobber you with all my might!

306
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:40,849
You're pretty gutsy...
confronting me like this.

307
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,310
Let's take this outside, brat!

308
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:44,501
Lady Tsunade!

309
00:26:52,897 --> 00:26:56,067
Though I may not look it,
I am one of the Sannin.

310
00:26:58,557 --> 00:27:00,517
Why should I even take a genin seriously.

311
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,454
What did you say?!

312
00:27:07,944 --> 00:27:09,446
An advance notice for a KO?

313
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,046
I don't mean one minute...

314
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:16,426
With one finger.
This is enough to take you down.

315
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:17,882
Lady Tsunade!

316
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,304
Well...

317
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,681
Come on, kiddo.

318
00:27:23,048 --> 00:27:25,107
D-Don't make fun of me!

319
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:34,986
Darn it!

320
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:39,698
Lady Tsunade!

321
00:27:45,365 --> 00:27:46,492
<i>Forehead poking?!</i>

322
00:27:47,312 --> 00:27:48,355
Why that no good!

323
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,672
<i>She's strong...</i>

324
00:27:55,814 --> 00:27:56,856
Hey, brat!

325
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,679
I'll ask you one thing before you faint.

326
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:07,435
Why...get so passionate at
the mention of Hokage's name?

327
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,610
Unlike you...

328
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,155
I will be the heir to the Hokage name,
no matter what!

329
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:22,826
Because Hokage is...

330
00:28:24,842 --> 00:28:27,595
Because Hokage is my dream!

331
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:32,918
That kid...

332
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:39,634
<i>What? She's a bit off her guard...</i>

333
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,011
<i>I can't tackle her head on.</i>

334
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,055
<i>Then, I should use that jutsu now...</i>

335
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:45,807
<i>Concentrate!</i>

336
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:58,902
<i>Oh, no!</i>

337
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,282
<i>Wha?! This jutsu is...!</i>

338
00:29:17,447 --> 00:29:21,117
<i>I never thought he'd attempt to use
the Fourth Hokage's jutsu.</i>

339
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,012
<i>But it's still just this level...</i>

340
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,983
<i>It's completely different
from the original one.</i>

341
00:29:27,902 --> 00:29:31,739
<i>That Tsunade...
Incredibly strong as always.</i>

342
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,273
<i>I remember a long time ago,</i>

343
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:38,651
<i>getting punched by her and
knocked back nearly 100 meters...</i>

344
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:43,782
<i>At any rate, Naruto's hopeless.</i>

345
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,825
Are you okay?

346
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,009
Jiraiya, was it you...

347
00:29:49,034 --> 00:29:51,234
who taught him that Rasengan,
the Spiral Chakura Sphere?

348
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:53,082
<i>Rasengan...?!</i>

349
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,754
I'm his teacher, after all.

350
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:02,717
Humph...You and the Fourth Hokage are
the only ones who can use that jutsu.

351
00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:05,953
Are you in your right mind...

352
00:30:06,254 --> 00:30:07,934
showing someone jutsu
that he can't master?

353
00:30:08,645 --> 00:30:10,605
Don't give him false hope.

354
00:30:11,115 --> 00:30:16,245
That's why the moony kid starts joking
about becoming a Hokage!

355
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:20,568
It's no joke! Stupid! Stupid!

356
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:23,780
If I have three days,
I'll master this jutsu!

357
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:27,158
You said it, kid.

358
00:30:27,807 --> 00:30:29,517
Men don't go back on their word!

359
00:30:29,806 --> 00:30:33,184
Hah! I stand by my words.

360
00:30:34,503 --> 00:30:36,630
That's my Ninja Way.

361
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,926
Then...how about a wager?

362
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:46,927
A wager...?

363
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,888
I'll give you one week.

364
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,891
If you can master that jutsu,

365
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:54,620
I'll acknowledge that you have
what it takes to become the Hokage

366
00:30:54,697 --> 00:30:56,657
and give you this necklace.

367
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,858
Lady Tsunade! That's the precious...!

368
00:31:00,236 --> 00:31:02,947
I don't need such a sorry necklace!

369
00:31:03,188 --> 00:31:04,648
Don't say such things, Naruto...

370
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,615
That's the only one of its kind in this wo

371
00:31:07,797 --> 00:31:10,037
And you could buy three mountains
if you were to sell it.

372
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,329
It belonged to the First Hokage.

373
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:16,082
<i>A-Awesome...</i>

374
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,252
Well, that'll be fine!

375
00:31:20,664 --> 00:31:22,374
<i>He'll do anything for money...?</i>

376
00:31:22,955 --> 00:31:23,955
Good...

377
00:31:23,995 --> 00:31:28,458
However, you lose if you can't master
the jutsu in one week!

378
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,057
And you'll give me all the money
you have on you.

379
00:31:31,292 --> 00:31:32,668
Oh! Gama chan!

380
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,920
When did she...?!

381
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,311
Lady Tsunade! Why?

382
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,520
That necklace is...

383
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:40,315
He won't be able to do it, anyway...

384
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,690
Let's go, Shizune.

385
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:46,696
<i>She never once used
that necklace for a bet...</i>

386
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:51,701
<i>You don't have to answer right now.</i>

387
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:55,079
<i>However, I want it in a week.</i>

388
00:32:05,224 --> 00:32:06,809
Oh, you are already at it, I see!

389
00:32:07,032 --> 00:32:08,033
Hi, welcome!

390
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:10,178
Why are you here?

391
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:13,640
You're cold. Don't say that.

392
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:15,975
Master Jiraiya...

393
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:20,813
Shizune, could you leave us?

394
00:32:21,476 --> 00:32:23,937
It's been a while.
I want to drink with her again.

395
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:27,695
Master, sake! And some radish!

396
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:28,779
Coming up!

397
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:34,744
<i>I'm counting on you, Master Jiraiya.</i>

398
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,410
Your radish is ready.

399
00:32:41,435 --> 00:32:43,270
Ooh. This looks good.

400
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:52,245
At any rate, to think you'd still be takin
good care of that necklace...

401
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:56,057
I thought you'd have lost it
long since to gambling.

402
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,632
It's a memento of those two, right?

403
00:33:07,573 --> 00:33:09,158
Is he on your mind...?

404
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,430
Who?

405
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:13,866
Naruto.

406
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,368
Not particularly...

407
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:20,665
Still, it's immature,
taking on that kid as an opponent...

408
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:25,044
He shouldn't be able to master
that jutsu in a week, right?

409
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,131
That's not what's called a bet.

410
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,176
What's with the fit of despair?

411
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:36,180
It's not a fit of despair!

412
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,101
Are you going to meet
Orochimaru again?

413
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,896
I can tell by looking at Shizune's face.

414
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,234
I don't know what kind of deal
he proposed,

415
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,237
but don't rush to a decision.

416
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:56,576
And...let me just tell you one thing.

417
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,537
The successive line of Hokages
have protected

418
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,790
the Leaf Village and those living in it.

419
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:07,420
They brought troubled times under control
and helped the village to prosper.

420
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,842
They risked their lives
for this dream, this ideal!

421
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,428
You're not someone who can't understand
the feelings of the previous Hokages.

422
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:20,892
Just try doing something
to betray the Leaf Village

423
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:26,773
When that happens, I'll kill you myself!

424
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,778
It has nothing to do with me now!

425
00:34:32,983 --> 00:34:35,423
A person who has experienced
the death of people close to them

426
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,492
and doesn't feel anything
is just a butcher.

427
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,661
You're different, aren't you?

428
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:45,541
No one cared for the welfare
of the villagers more than you.

429
00:34:47,393 --> 00:34:48,686
At that time, too...

430
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,797
That's enough with the lecture!

431
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:57,470
Why...did you bring that kid?

432
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,556
<i>Becoming the Hokage is my dream.</i>

433
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,393
He resembles him, doesn't he?

434
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,938
His age is about the same, too...

435
00:35:08,332 --> 00:35:09,400
Not just that...

436
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:17,448
<i>Becoming the Hokage is my dream!</i>

437
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,246
<i>Geez, you do nothing,
but reckless things.</i>

438
00:35:23,271 --> 00:35:24,355
<i>Do you want to die?</i>

439
00:35:24,931 --> 00:35:28,976
<i>You're still a genin,
so on the battlefield just run away.</i>

440
00:35:29,167 --> 00:35:31,837
<i>Don't tell a man to "run away!"</i>

441
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:36,092
<i>That dream...And his cockiness as well...</i>

442
00:35:39,717 --> 00:35:43,429
Huh? Who is it this late at night?

443
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:47,061
Okay, okay. I'm coming.

444
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:53,151
I'm sorry to bother you so late, Naruto.
I need to talk to you...

445
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:58,072
As for me, I'm going to get
a good night's rest and train tomorrow!

446
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:02,743
I'm sorry. But I didn't want you
to misunderstand Lady Tsunade...

447
00:36:03,973 --> 00:36:06,058
As well as the necklace...

448
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:29,312
Nawaki, happy twelfth birthday!

449
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:35,985
I'm not a kid anymore,
so I don't need gifts on my birthday!

450
00:36:36,263 --> 00:36:39,308
What're you saying?
You're still a kid, aren't you?!

451
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:42,416
But never mind that.
Hurry up and open your present!

452
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:44,493
You'll definitely be pleased!

453
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,920
Big Sister, could this be?

454
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:59,425
Yes...It's the First Hokage's,
our grandfather's necklace!

455
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,177
I love you, Big Sister!

456
00:37:02,236 --> 00:37:04,363
I thought it'd be better than me having it

457
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:10,186
You've been wanting it all along, right?
Take good care of it.

458
00:37:10,792 --> 00:37:12,794
Not just this necklace!

459
00:37:13,934 --> 00:37:19,648
This village is grandfather's treasure!
I'm going to protect it!

460
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:21,572
Nawaki...

461
00:37:22,464 --> 00:37:26,635
I'm the grandson of the Hokage who
built the Village Hidden in Leaves, so...!

462
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,623
You said it.
Men don't go back on their word!

463
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:31,499
Right!

464
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:35,795
Someday, I'll become just like Grandfather
And the Hokage name will be mine!

465
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:40,591
Becoming the Hokage is my dream!

466
00:37:44,075 --> 00:37:46,035
Take off your headband, Nawaki.

467
00:37:47,511 --> 00:37:50,764
Just hurry up and take it off.
I have another present for you.

468
00:37:53,261 --> 00:37:55,471
It's a charm to make
your dream come true.

469
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:25,428
It's best if you don't look
at the remains.

470
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,347
There's nothing wrong with that,
is there?

471
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,308
Even if she were to look,

472
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,311
she wouldn't be able to determine
that it's her little brother.

473
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:34,729
Enough, Orochimaru!

474
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:41,068
We are at war, now.
All shinobi end up like this.

475
00:38:41,617 --> 00:38:44,453
There are no doctors on
the battlefield, so...

476
00:38:45,101 --> 00:38:48,896
However, children really get
much too excited, don't they?

477
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,664
Especially on the day after
they receive a present.

478
00:39:04,267 --> 00:39:06,227
<i>Not just this necklace...</i>

479
00:39:09,544 --> 00:39:14,674
<i>This village is grandfather's treasure!
I'm going to protect it!</i>

480
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:19,648
First, in a mission where
a Four Man Cell must act alone

481
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,985
for a long period of time
in enemy territory,

482
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:26,947
by deploying one of the four
to be a medical specialist,

483
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:30,374
the survival rate as well as
the mission success rate

484
00:39:30,399 --> 00:39:32,067
should go up significantly.

485
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:33,996
Therefore, establishing a framework

486
00:39:34,021 --> 00:39:35,832
to foster ninja possessing
advanced medical skills

487
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,517
and the development of
a medical institution

488
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:42,421
should be considered
an urgent task for the present!

489
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:47,124
Yes indeed, it's as you say.

490
00:39:47,999 --> 00:39:49,917
But we're in the middle of a war now.

491
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:54,642
It takes too much time to
establish a medical framework.

492
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,186
And at present,
we don't have enough knowledge...

493
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:00,106
Enemies don't wait.

494
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,109
What did you say?! Hey, old man!

495
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,736
Then we'll never...

496
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:08,030
I agree with her.

497
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:13,035
I don't want the lives of the shinobi
who died to be for naught.

498
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,579
There should be something
we can learn from that.

499
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,334
Excuse me!

500
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:22,335
Thanks for earlier.

501
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,674
What you said was right.

502
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:29,717
Umm...

503
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:33,264
It's late.
Shall I walk you home?

504
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:36,804
What? Is that okay with you?
Where's your home?

505
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:38,769
The other way.

506
00:40:39,254 --> 00:40:40,588
Then don't bother.

507
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:44,900
I don't mind.
I also want to talk with you.

508
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:50,072
And I would always use this path
to the Academy to pick up my little sister

509
00:40:50,275 --> 00:40:51,693
I loved this path.

510
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,742
What? You loved?

511
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:58,914
Yeah. In the battle when the Leaf
was attacked at night one year ago,

512
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,249
my little sister was...

513
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,920
<i>This man...is the same as me.</i>

514
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:14,513
<i>Tomorrow's mission will be
within enemy lines...</i>

515
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:21,020
Fighting and losing cherished people
is not the only way for a shinobi.

516
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:22,229
Uh huh.

517
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:25,566
I'm living in a world of shinobi
where death always hovers.

518
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:30,070
I want to risk my life to bring
this war torn world under control.

519
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:34,241
I love this village and my comrades.

520
00:41:34,978 --> 00:41:37,022
So I want to protect them.

521
00:41:37,947 --> 00:41:42,869
Since my little sister died,
that sole thought has sustained me.

522
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,586
So I'll become the Hokage...

523
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:47,732
An existence that protects everyone...

524
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:52,092
Becoming the Hokage is my dream.

525
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:01,434
Dan...

526
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:11,028
I'd like you...to take this.

527
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,078
Hang on, Dan!

528
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:24,375
Tsunade...I don't want...to die yet.

529
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:29,880
I have many things that I must...do.

530
00:42:29,982 --> 00:42:31,108
Don't talk, Dan!

531
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,801
<i>His kidney has been blown out...</i>

532
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:37,638
<i>It's futile even for Tsunade
who is known as one of the Sannin...</i>

533
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:43,269
I...must not...die here.

534
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:47,231
It'll be okay. I stopped the bleeding.

535
00:42:48,214 --> 00:42:51,718
So it'll be okay...You'll be saved, Dan!

536
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,821
Really?

537
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,074
Thank goodness...

538
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,494
Dan! Hang on!

539
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:01,953
Dan!

540
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,168
Dang it! Don't come out...

541
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,380
Stop...Please stop!

542
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,674
Stop...Stop...

543
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:16,093
Stop...Stop...

544
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:20,014
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

545
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:20,848
Stop, I say!

546
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,474
That's enough. He's dead!

547
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:20,949
No good! Dang it! Dang it!
Tomorrow, for sure!

548
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,829
My head hurts.

549
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:30,417
I totally got sick from drinking,
thanks to her...

550
00:44:34,598 --> 00:44:40,103
<i>It seems Naruto never came home
last night...</i>

551
00:44:48,478 --> 00:44:51,189
<i>He's such a fool.</i>

552
00:45:03,614 --> 00:45:06,283
<i>Why don't we make a deal?</i>

553
00:45:07,103 --> 00:45:11,608
<i>I'll resurrect the little brother
and man, both of whom you loved...</i>

554
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:15,587
<i>with the Forbidden Jutsu I've developed.</i>

555
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:20,926
<i>Don't you want to see those two,
Tsunade?</i>

556
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,100
<i>If I treat your arms...</i>

557
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,311
<i>What do you intend to do with them?</i>

558
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:35,482
<i>This time, I will completely
destroy Leaf Village!</i>

559
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:38,652
<i>No! You must not believe
in their sweet talk...</i>

560
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:40,738
<i>Their wishes...</i>

561
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:45,217
<i>Moreover, Tsunade, your wishes...
And dreams...Did you forget them?!</i>

562
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:46,702
<i>I'll be straight with you.</i>

563
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:52,916
<i>Tsunade, the village has demanded
that you become the Fifth Hokage.</i>

564
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:23,238
<i>Listen, in this third step,</i>

565
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:26,158
<i>you've got to use 100%
of what you have learned...</i>

566
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:27,576
<i>And retain them.</i>

567
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:41,673
<i>In other words,</i>

568
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:44,468
<i>imagine creating a single layer
within the balloon</i>

569
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:47,429
<i>and compressing the chakra inside it.</i>

570
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:52,559
<i>I know that in my head...</i>

571
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:54,853
<i>But no matter what,</i>

572
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:59,233
<i>I can't completely hold 100%
of my power in a neat ball...</i>

573
00:47:21,116 --> 00:47:25,631
<i>Don't give him false hope by teaching him
something he can't master.</i>

574
00:47:26,734 --> 00:47:32,531
<i>That's why the moony kid
starts joking about becoming a Hokage!</i>

575
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,360
Not good...

576
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:51,577
Dang it! Dang it!
This time for sure...no matter what!

577
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:17,394
Tomorrow, huh.

578
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,066
Come again, okay?

579
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:25,527
I certainly will!

580
00:48:41,243 --> 00:48:43,370
<i>Are you going to meet
Orochimaru again?</i>

581
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,722
<i>To think she'd be that shaken up...</i>

582
00:48:54,643 --> 00:48:56,812
<i>Something extreme must have happened.</i>

583
00:48:58,682 --> 00:49:02,019
<i>That one week bugs me, somehow...</i>

584
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:12,115
<i>And Naruto hasn't come back
to the inn for nearly a week.</i>

585
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:16,787
<i>I guess I'll press Tsunade a little more.</i>

586
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,009
<i>No good...</i>

587
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,264
<i>No good...Why?</i>

588
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:42,479
<i>Here there's no time...
It'll be too late.</i>

589
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,071
<i>What's this...?!</i>

590
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:57,244
What happened, Naruto?!

591
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:58,703
Are you okay?

592
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,012
What do you want?

593
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,306
The moon's out.

594
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,269
How about going out for a drink?

595
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:36,199
Tomorrow will be the one week
you promised to Naruto.

596
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,625
I wonder what became of Naruto?

597
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,088
Beats me.

598
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:57,846
I guess I'll have something.

599
00:50:58,138 --> 00:50:59,181
Radish, please.

600
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:00,389
Coming up.

601
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:13,695
Oh?

602
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:19,784
Here you go.

603
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:23,747
Ooh! This looks good.

604
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:47,395
Lady Tsunade!

605
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,274
What happened to Naruto?

606
00:51:52,687 --> 00:51:54,105
He's quite exhausted and weakened.

607
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:58,156
And his right hand is severely burned
with chakra...

608
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,952
As it stands now,

609
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:04,727
this kid probably won't wake up
until the day after tomorrow.

610
00:52:07,779 --> 00:52:09,280
It's as Jiraiya says...

611
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:13,516
Why did I make such a stupid bet?

612
00:52:15,405 --> 00:52:18,492
What am I, of all people,
getting so worked up for?

613
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:20,846
How stupid.

614
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:27,476
Tomorrow...

615
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,075
Please don't go tomorrow!

616
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:38,405
Why don't you say anything?!

617
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:41,950
Lady Tsunade! Please don't be silent.
Please answer!

618
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:46,454
If you say that you're going...

619
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:49,541
What will you do?

620
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:53,003
I'll stop you with my life!

621
00:52:56,688 --> 00:53:00,513
Shizune...Have you forgotten
who you're talking to?

622
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:28,163
It'll be troublesome if we're disturbed
during the negotiations...

623
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,371
What do you want me to do?

624
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:36,254
It might be good to kill...
Tsunade's attendant.

625
00:53:44,475 --> 00:53:45,475
Hey!

626
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:47,849
I said hey!

627
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,230
Naruto?

628
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:59,778
Oh no! What time is it?
No, what day is it?

629
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:02,030
It's Monday...

630
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:06,326
What is it?

631
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:09,537
Is your body okay?

632
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:13,416
As I recall, you were supposed
to sleep for two full days...

633
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,086
No matter what the wound,

634
00:54:16,242 --> 00:54:21,956
I'm always able to recover
if I sleep one night!

635
00:54:22,624 --> 00:54:25,252
<i>That's right.
This kid has Nine-Tailed Fox's power...</i>

636
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:29,557
More importantly,
where's that stupid old woman?!

637
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:32,978
Today's the promised bet day.

638
00:54:33,154 --> 00:54:34,864
Then, what about the jutsu...

639
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:41,236
It's still not complete, but I can wing it
Believe it!

640
00:54:45,171 --> 00:54:47,090
<i>That's right. This isn't the time for this</i>

641
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:49,911
- Naruto, please stay...
- Huh?

642
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:53,539
You are...!

643
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,917
What?! Oh!

644
00:54:58,295 --> 00:54:59,963
Wait, Shizune!

645
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:07,470
That darned Tsunade spiked my drink.

646
00:55:08,463 --> 00:55:11,007
I can't build up my chakra well...

647
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:15,312
And my body is so numb,
I can barely throw a kunai knife.

648
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:19,482
<i>What was he gonna do
if that had hit me?!</i>

649
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:24,321
That's lame! Here you're always bragging
about how you're this awesome ninja!

650
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:27,198
And you're nailed by her perverted attack?
You, Pervy Pervy Sage?!

651
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:28,575
Shut up!

652
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,163
Even if she's rotten,
she's still a medical specialist.

653
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:39,794
She's the only one who could concoct
a tasteless and odorless drug for ninja.

654
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:44,924
But to think I'd be caught off-guard,

655
00:55:44,949 --> 00:55:46,617
no matter how intoxicated I was...

656
00:55:50,666 --> 00:55:54,295
<i>I never thought I'd end up encountering
that Master Jiraiya in a place like this..</i>

657
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:59,564
<i>Things have gotten difficult.
I guess I'll pull back for now.</i>

658
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:05,862
<i>At any rate, Naruto...
To think you'd be here, too...</i>

659
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,495
Hey! Shizune.

660
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:14,996
Y-Yes?!

661
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:17,265
It's about time you tell me

662
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:21,586
what the heck she was talking about
with Orochimaru.

663
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,463
Orochimaru?!

664
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:30,970
I wanted to believe Lady Tsunade...

665
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:35,266
That's why I couldn't say until now.

666
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:38,143
But...

667
00:56:40,462 --> 00:56:43,465
There's no time.
Please come with me!

668
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,527
I'll explain as we run!

669
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:46,528
Okay!

670
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:47,904
I'm going, too!

671
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:10,760
What's your answer?

672
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:14,097
Say what?!

673
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:18,059
The answer to that is definitely no!

674
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:22,105
<i>This might be really bad...</i>

675
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:27,944
<i>She's probably still thinking
of those two.</i>

676
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:36,578
<i>Perhaps I may have no choice,
but to kill Tsunade...</i>

677
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:40,039
<i>Dang it!</i>

678
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:53,761
I'll heal your arms...

679
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:58,099
In exchange for that,
keep your hands off the village.

680
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,270
Very well.

681
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:43,268
Now then...

682
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:01,496
He's planning to once again attack

683
00:59:02,017 --> 00:59:04,019
the Leaf Village if
his arms are healed!

684
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:08,002
The situation will get
even more dangerous than that

685
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:10,088
if he's not stopped now.

686
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,465
Him screwing around like that!

687
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:20,515
<i>I have you.
There's no need to worry...</i>

688
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:12,150
How is that your answer...
Princess Tsunade?

689
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:15,737
To think you'd try to kill me...

690
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:21,034
At any rate,
I have a sincere trust in you, Kabuto.

691
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:28,082
A trust for your loyalty and your eyes
that spotted Tsunade's attack.

692
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:31,377
Yes. We're both from
the same medical corps so...

693
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:34,010
Her chakra was overflowing
with violent intent.

694
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:43,556
Tsunade...I was really planning
on resurrecting those two people.

695
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:49,228
And here I went so far as to promise
not to smash the Leaf Village...

696
01:00:55,068 --> 01:01:00,448
I know that your promise of
"not touching the village" was a lie...

697
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:05,203
Even though I knew that...I...

698
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:10,833
after all, these are feelings
that won't decay...

699
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:20,176
So our negotiations have broken down...
It can't be helped.

700
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:24,389
Since it's come to this, I have no choice
but to ask forcibly.

701
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,704
Come! Orochimaru!

702
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:51,398
Come to think of it,

703
01:01:51,423 --> 01:01:54,802
we've never gone at it
even once until now.

704
01:01:58,965 --> 01:01:59,882
That's right!

705
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:01,134
What're you saying?

706
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:03,389
I'm the one who has
to go at it with her, right?

707
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:07,223
Now I'm going to kill
you two worthless punks...here!

708
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:10,935
Incredible strength as usual...

709
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:14,313
It'll be over if you're hit once.

710
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:16,315
I can see that...

711
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:22,822
It's a bit cramped here
for fighting at a distance.

712
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:24,761
Are you going to change the location?

713
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:26,521
That would probably be better...

714
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:31,706
There was another troublesome person
with the Lady Tsunade's attendant.

715
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:34,667
That person may come
to her aid.

716
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:37,502
You're going down!

717
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:43,342
Who is...the troublesome person?

718
01:02:43,634 --> 01:02:45,762
One of Sannin,
the same as you and Lady Tsunade...

719
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,263
<i>Jiraiya!</i>

720
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:58,316
<i>I won't let you get away,
no matter what!</i>

721
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:06,783
Wh-What's this?!

722
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:14,499
Huh...Princess Tsunade tore it up...
big time.

723
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:18,669
<i>This means that Lady Tsunade refused...</i>

724
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:23,216
Where did old Tsunade go?

725
01:03:29,096 --> 01:03:30,598
<i>That belongs to Lady Tsunade...!</i>

726
01:03:33,851 --> 01:03:35,436
Tonton...Which way?

727
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:38,647
Okay!

728
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:56,207
It looks like you're quite
out of breath, too...Tsunade.

729
01:03:57,458 --> 01:03:58,709
It's just about time.

730
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:04,382
I'm not that great at taijutsu, but...

731
01:04:10,137 --> 01:04:11,137
<i>A food pill!</i>

732
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:17,937
<i>This kid can also use medical ninjutsu...</i>

733
01:04:43,504 --> 01:04:44,504
<i>He got my muscle...!</i>

734
01:04:45,923 --> 01:04:47,341
I severed, ever so slightly,

735
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:50,469
the bicep muscle of your upper arm
and the rectus muscle of your thigh.

736
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,681
Now you won't be able to release
your incredible strength.

737
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:58,269
A chakra scalpel, eh...
Why don't you target the arteries?

738
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:00,980
Indeed, with this scalpel,

739
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:05,401
I could cut the muscles and vessels
without external injury.

740
01:05:06,193 --> 01:05:07,570
But as may be expected,

741
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:10,573
I can't make a long, delicate scalpel
in the middle of battle

742
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:13,326
that can reach the arteries
and the heart muscle.

743
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:15,369
But, even so...

744
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:25,838
<i>Dang it! My intercostals got hit.
My breathing...</i>

745
01:05:27,506 --> 01:05:30,343
<i>He's no ordinary medical ninja.</i>

746
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:35,181
<i>His jutsu sense and his edge
exceed even me in my heyday!</i>

747
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:40,102
It would still be trouble
if you were to die on me.

748
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:42,257
I won't target your vital spot...

749
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:46,108
But with this, you can't move anymore...

750
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:01,540
<i>She's amazing...</i>

751
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:05,586
<i>Ordinarily, one wouldn't be able
to budge due to difficulty breathing.</i>

752
01:06:06,253 --> 01:06:11,509
<i>It looks like it will be necessary
to rough her up a little more...</i>

753
01:06:18,849 --> 01:06:20,601
<i>Even though I'm trying to move my hand...</i>

754
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:24,021
<i>my leg moves?!</i>

755
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:27,650
<i>D-Don't tell me! This is...</i>

756
01:06:30,277 --> 01:06:31,277
You little!

757
01:06:38,452 --> 01:06:39,745
<i>In my present condition,</i>

758
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,956
<i>this seems to be the extent of my power...</i>

759
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:50,131
I see...

760
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:57,013
<i>It's...It's not the muscles...
It's the nerves!</i>

761
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:03,394
It seems you've realized...
That's right. It's the nerves!

762
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:06,897
I changed chakra into electricity...

763
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:11,068
made an electrical field and
poured electricity into your nerves.

764
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:15,281
<i>The communication between
the brain and the body</i>

765
01:07:15,406 --> 01:07:18,325
<i>is all done with electric signals...</i>

766
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:24,874
<i>Tsunade jumbled up all of
the electric signals that are exchanged</i>

767
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:27,835
<i>at a velocity of 360 kilometers per hour.</i>

768
01:07:30,337 --> 01:07:32,840
<i>Having left battle and yet such power...</i>

769
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:35,176
<i>So this is the legendary Sannin?</i>

770
01:07:39,013 --> 01:07:41,724
<i>Healing types use too much chakra...</i>

771
01:07:42,516 --> 01:07:43,642
<i>But in this condition...</i>

772
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:52,026
<i>If I try to move my right hand...</i>

773
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:56,197
<i>my left leg moves.</i>

774
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,825
<i>If I try to move my left ankle...</i>

775
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:03,370
<i>my right shoulder moves.</i>

776
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:11,628
<i>It's difficult...</i>

777
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:18,594
<i>But I've already grasped eighty percent
of what moves when I move what.</i>

778
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:22,098
Don't mess with me...

779
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:23,891
with this low-level...

780
01:08:26,727 --> 01:08:27,727
jutsu!

781
01:08:28,312 --> 01:08:31,107
<i>What?! In only a moment,
his body movements...</i>

782
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:33,234
You're scared of blood, aren't you?!

783
01:08:34,568 --> 01:08:36,570
I'll show you plenty from now!

784
01:08:47,873 --> 01:08:48,873
Jiraiya...?

785
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:52,711
It's been a long time...Jiraiya.

786
01:08:57,007 --> 01:09:00,177
You've got an evil look as usual.

787
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:07,476
Huh?!

788
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,270
K-Kabuto?

789
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:12,148
Naruto...

790
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,529
I see...So you know each other?

791
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:22,116
We took the Chunin Exam together!

792
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:25,452
Why are you here, Kabuto...?

793
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:28,663
Get out of the way!

794
01:09:28,747 --> 01:09:29,747
Hey...

795
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:31,833
I'll take...

796
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:33,169
these guys!

797
01:09:36,046 --> 01:09:39,049
Just because you've mastered
your body movements...

798
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:41,635
it doesn't mean...

799
01:09:42,219 --> 01:09:43,679
you can move like normal!

800
01:09:46,932 --> 01:09:48,142
I won't let you get away now!

801
01:09:49,226 --> 01:09:50,226
Too late!

802
01:09:58,110 --> 01:10:00,946
My body movements have
finally returned...

803
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,239
<i>Blood...!</i>

804
01:10:06,118 --> 01:10:10,539
Having two of the legendary Sannin
as opponents is hairy, isn't it...?

805
01:10:11,415 --> 01:10:13,667
So even if it's just one...
I'll stop you!

806
01:10:15,961 --> 01:10:16,961
Lady Tsunade!

807
01:10:18,672 --> 01:10:22,885
Say! Say! What's happening?!

808
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:25,638
Why's Kabuto fighting
with old Tsunade?!

809
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:30,351
You're slow, Naruto...

810
01:10:32,436 --> 01:10:34,813
That's why you're no match for Sasuke.

811
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:40,402
Take a good look at the headband!

812
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:43,864
He's Orochimaru's subordinate.

813
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:45,490
Wha?!

814
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:47,325
That's right...

815
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:50,120
I was a spy from
the Village Hidden in the Sound.

816
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:58,045
During the Chunin Exam
you taught us a lot...

817
01:10:58,170 --> 01:10:59,630
And you also saved us.

818
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:04,260
Well, I wanted to gather data
on you guys.

819
01:11:05,803 --> 01:11:10,641
Naruto, there's something
I understood by gathering your data.

820
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,271
You have no ninja ability.

821
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:19,233
Unlike Sasuke!

822
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:34,373
<i>It's the first time
I've seen Lady Tsunade like this...</i>

823
01:11:39,753 --> 01:11:42,298
Please don't push it too far alone.

824
01:11:44,758 --> 01:11:47,511
I'm your attendant, so...

825
01:11:49,179 --> 01:11:50,681
<i>Old Lady Tsunade...</i>

826
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:54,935
Even with a fierce look,

827
01:11:55,352 --> 01:11:58,314
you're just a cute genin
who's a fish out of water.

828
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:03,861
Admittedly, I was anticipating
the monster dwelling inside you...

829
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,031
But now,
with the legendary Sannin before me,

830
01:12:07,364 --> 01:12:08,949
you leave something to be desired.

831
01:12:10,534 --> 01:12:15,539
You're just a puny zero.
So if you meddle...

832
01:12:16,415 --> 01:12:17,416
I'll kill you.

833
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:20,752
You little!

834
01:12:21,253 --> 01:12:22,254
Don't, Naruto!

835
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:24,798
<i>My body's still...</i>

836
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:27,425
<i>That hand...</i>

837
01:12:27,968 --> 01:12:30,220
<i>He shouldn't be able to use
that right hand anymore.</i>

838
01:12:32,222 --> 01:12:33,640
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

839
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,769
<i>I'll attack at once with four...</i>

840
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:39,938
<i>and break him from the right side
where he can't defend!</i>

841
01:12:44,902 --> 01:12:45,902
You little!

842
01:12:46,278 --> 01:12:47,278
Okay!

843
01:13:05,339 --> 01:13:06,339
<i>Poison needles!</i>

844
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:14,932
Thanks, Shizune!

845
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:20,813
A plasma pill!

846
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:22,856
A plasma pill?

847
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:31,448
So he's trying to replenish
lost blood, huh...

848
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:35,327
The blood is gushing out nicely,
eh, Kabuto?

849
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:37,078
Lord Orochimaru...

850
01:13:37,996 --> 01:13:40,249
Please take off the bandage
on your left arm.

851
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:52,761
That man is Orochimaru...

852
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:56,348
Shizune, you take care of
the guy with the glasses...

853
01:13:57,015 --> 01:13:59,393
I'll take care of Orochimaru.

854
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:08,277
Before that, I'd like to have Tsunade
do something about this body.

855
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:12,281
The effects of that drug
might still last for awhile...

856
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:14,783
There's nothing that
I can do about it.

857
01:14:14,908 --> 01:14:16,827
What? Really?

858
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:19,496
Geez. I guess it can't be helped.

859
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:22,458
I have no choice
but to fight in this condition.

860
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:27,337
Tsunade...Rest your body
with recovery ninjutsu.

861
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:29,506
Then...What about me, me?

862
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:33,969
You guard Tsunade together
with that pig.

863
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:38,348
What?! I want to fight, too.
Even I can...

864
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:39,475
No, you won't!

865
01:14:39,933 --> 01:14:41,768
Like that four-eyed kid said, right?

866
01:14:42,519 --> 01:14:43,812
You're on a different level.

867
01:14:45,105 --> 01:14:47,816
The opponent is a Sannin like myself,

868
01:14:47,941 --> 01:14:49,818
and the man who killed
the Third Hokage

869
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:55,365
An eye for an eye...
I'm the only one who can fight him.

870
01:14:56,283 --> 01:15:00,496
And that four-eyed guy possesses
the same level of power as Kakashi.

871
01:15:02,789 --> 01:15:05,834
Now then, let's get this thing started.

872
01:15:17,012 --> 01:15:18,639
<i>- Summoning Jutsu.
- Summoning Jutsu.</i>

873
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:30,775
Hi.

874
01:15:31,276 --> 01:15:33,278
- Huh?!
- What is this?!

875
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,030
- Wha?!
- What the heck's going on?!

876
01:15:35,322 --> 01:15:36,782
Long time no see.

877
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:42,329
It looks like your stupid
still hasn't healed, eh, Jiraiya.

878
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:47,292
That's too much even for you
with no ability.

879
01:15:48,293 --> 01:15:51,296
It seems Tsunade got you
with something.

880
01:15:52,422 --> 01:15:55,425
<i>To think I'd already have
my handicap spotted.</i>

881
01:15:57,636 --> 01:16:00,847
You are such
a disgraceful guy as always...

882
01:16:01,682 --> 01:16:06,478
<i>Dang it. It kind of ticks me off
when the Pervy Sage is mocked.</i>

883
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:09,690
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

884
01:16:13,026 --> 01:16:16,154
<i>The Nine-Tailed Fox kid
from the Chunin Exam.</i>

885
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:20,075
I wonder if I should've killed him then,
after all.

886
01:16:20,784 --> 01:16:23,412
For the sake of the Akatsuki organization,

887
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:25,872
I acknowledged his achievement...
and let him slide by.

888
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:29,668
But the only ones who can break
a Five-Pronged Spell

889
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:33,422
are the Sannin members
and the Third Hokage.

890
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:37,175
Which means Jiraiya may have
already taught it to Naruto.

891
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:39,720
Perhaps.

892
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:44,266
If he's able to control
the Nine-Tailed Fox's power...

893
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:51,231
It doesn't quite look to be so.

894
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:57,404
He isn't endowed with shinobi ability
to begin with, so...

895
01:16:58,238 --> 01:17:00,657
<i>He's still got a long way to go,
sure enough.</i>

896
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:03,285
Why?!

897
01:17:05,162 --> 01:17:07,039
Hello.

898
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:11,209
Hey, Gamatatsu.
Why did you come out?

899
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:14,796
Oh, Brother Gamakichi.

900
01:17:15,422 --> 01:17:17,841
It's the first time I've been summoned.

901
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:20,052
I-I wonder if I can do my best?

902
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:24,306
Idiot. Get some snacks
or something and hide.

903
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:29,269
What? I can get snacks?
Goody goody.

904
01:17:29,728 --> 01:17:30,728
Here I go.

905
01:17:33,732 --> 01:17:35,359
I'll take Jiraiya.

906
01:17:36,109 --> 01:17:38,570
I leave the rest to you.

907
01:18:01,301 --> 01:18:02,511
Naruto!

908
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:06,139
Your opponent is me.

909
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:12,604
<i>Earth Style: Dark Swamp!</i>

910
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:27,994
Dang it. I can't completely sink them
with such a puny swamp.

911
01:18:28,912 --> 01:18:30,831
<i>The drug is still working.</i>

912
01:18:31,915 --> 01:18:35,752
But...with this, the snakes can't move.

913
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:39,464
<i>Ninja Art: Poison Fog!</i>

914
01:18:42,467 --> 01:18:44,227
<i>I'll be up a creek if
I take even one breath.</i>

915
01:18:49,641 --> 01:18:50,934
<i>My leg tendons...!</i>

916
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:57,482
I won't be eaten twice...!
No way!

917
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:15,167
Here I go.

918
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:23,800
<i>Ninja Art: Needle Jizo!</i>

919
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:31,850
Dang it...The jutsu isn't working well.

920
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:36,938
Even if we both have handicaps,
you won't one up me...

921
01:19:37,272 --> 01:19:39,399
Give up now.

922
01:20:12,891 --> 01:20:13,975
It's unfortunate...

923
01:20:14,434 --> 01:20:18,188
Here I had respected you
as a fellow medical ninja.

924
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:20,816
Stop. Stay back!

925
01:20:21,107 --> 01:20:23,485
Please hang on, Lady Tsunade...

926
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:29,741
The Sannin name, which Lord Orochimaru
is also called, will cry.

927
01:20:35,038 --> 01:20:36,998
My body's heavy.

928
01:20:40,168 --> 01:20:44,172
To think you who were
once called the village madness

929
01:20:44,297 --> 01:20:48,969
would ferry around such a kid
and struggle tirelessly for the village.

930
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:50,720
You've really fallen, haven't you?

931
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:55,851
I have a keen eye to discern ability.

932
01:20:57,477 --> 01:21:02,899
And that kid...is mediocrity in my eyes.

933
01:21:04,150 --> 01:21:09,322
It's precisely for this reason...
that I don't need the Uchiha kid.

934
01:21:10,156 --> 01:21:14,828
It's no fun raising a genius
who's good from the start.

935
01:21:16,663 --> 01:21:18,915
So you can't leave him alone

936
01:21:18,999 --> 01:21:21,126
because it's like you're looking
at your old self?

937
01:21:21,793 --> 01:21:28,633
That kid can't beat Uchiha who inherited
the inherent Sharingan shinobi skill.

938
01:21:29,175 --> 01:21:33,346
And that's because Naruto
doesn't possess the Sharingan.

939
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:35,473
shinobi ability is about whether

940
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:41,438
one can use and master
all the jutsu of the world.

941
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:47,235
Ninja refers to one
who can use ninjutsu.

942
01:21:50,363 --> 01:21:53,700
Shinobi ability is no such thing.

943
01:21:54,993 --> 01:21:56,786
You still don't get it?

944
01:21:58,121 --> 01:22:02,876
A ninja...is one who endures.

945
01:22:04,377 --> 01:22:06,212
It's a difference of opinion, huh.

946
01:22:07,631 --> 01:22:10,216
I'll teach you one thing.

947
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:14,804
What's most important for shinobi ability.

948
01:22:15,472 --> 01:22:18,725
isn't the number of jutsu
one possesses.

949
01:22:19,392 --> 01:22:21,478
What's important is...

950
01:22:22,395 --> 01:22:24,189
The mettle...

951
01:22:24,272 --> 01:22:26,942
not to give up.

952
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:37,202
Enough already...you jerk!

953
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:02,477
<i>Heh. I don't know what jutsu you learned,</i>

954
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:06,147
<i>but you can't hit me with
such a large motion.</i>

955
01:23:08,483 --> 01:23:09,693
<i>No good.</i>

956
01:23:09,776 --> 01:23:12,445
<i>It won't easily hit with
a moving opponent.</i>

957
01:23:16,574 --> 01:23:18,284
Owwee!

958
01:23:19,536 --> 01:23:22,914
<i>And the chakra isn't
completely held, yet...</i>

959
01:23:23,748 --> 01:23:26,751
It seems you got a cracked thigh bone
in your left leg

960
01:23:26,876 --> 01:23:29,087
from the battle with the snake.

961
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:33,174
Well, you can still move if
it's just the bone.

962
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:35,468
But it's impossible now...

963
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:39,681
The lateral vastus muscle
in your right leg is totally cut off.

964
01:23:41,391 --> 01:23:43,476
What should I do...?

965
01:23:43,643 --> 01:23:46,312
<i>That jutsu of mine uses both hands.</i>

966
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:48,523
<i>If even one arm is taken out, it's over.</i>

967
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:54,571
Are you scared of me?

968
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:56,865
Do you want to run away from here?

969
01:23:58,199 --> 01:24:00,827
Naruto, as I recall,

970
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:04,164
you whooped it up like this
during the first Chunin Exam.

971
01:24:04,789 --> 01:24:07,834
"Don't mess with me. I won't run away."

972
01:24:08,334 --> 01:24:12,005
"I'll take it. Even if I'm a genin for life"

973
01:24:12,088 --> 01:24:15,717
"I'll become the Hokage at any cost,
so it's okay with me."

974
01:24:16,176 --> 01:24:17,510
"I'm not scared."

975
01:24:18,511 --> 01:24:21,222
Can you...
whoop it up in the same way now?

976
01:24:23,808 --> 01:24:25,018
<i>Unlike you...</i>

977
01:24:25,101 --> 01:24:29,606
<i>I will be the heir to the Hokage name
no matter what!</i>

978
01:24:32,984 --> 01:24:35,403
<i>- Hokage is my dream!
- Hokage is my dream!</i>

979
01:24:39,115 --> 01:24:43,203
You're not a kid anymore,
so you should stop whooping it up...

980
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:45,038
Depending on the situation,

981
01:24:45,121 --> 01:24:48,208
when you want to give up and run away,
you should run away.

982
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:57,258
Oh my...What's with that look?

983
01:24:58,051 --> 01:25:01,554
You'll die! If you die,
there are no dreams or anything...

984
01:25:05,058 --> 01:25:06,392
<i>Do you want to die?</i>

985
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:11,397
<i>You're still a genin,
so you should run away on the battlefield.</i>

986
01:25:12,273 --> 01:25:14,943
<i>Don't tell a man to run away.</i>

987
01:25:40,093 --> 01:25:42,762
Kids think that everything is easy.

988
01:25:43,596 --> 01:25:47,183
That's why they talk about foolish dreams
like nothing at all.

989
01:25:47,433 --> 01:25:49,602
That's why they can't give up.

990
01:25:51,396 --> 01:25:55,692
<i>Jiraiya, was it you
who taught him that Rasengan?</i>

991
01:25:56,526 --> 01:26:00,613
<i>Are you acting like a teacher by teaching
a jutsu that can't be learned?</i>

992
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:02,657
<i>Don't give him false hopes.</i>

993
01:26:03,241 --> 01:26:08,663
<i>That's why a moony kid starts joking
that he'll become the Hokage!</i>

994
01:26:15,712 --> 01:26:19,215
They chase after foolish dreams...
and then die.

995
01:26:28,683 --> 01:26:30,560
Bastard!

996
01:26:33,104 --> 01:26:37,066
As for me...I stand by my words.

997
01:26:38,902 --> 01:26:42,697
That's...my Way of Ninja!

998
01:26:48,286 --> 01:26:50,622
You should've just
stayed out of this...

999
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:04,761
Why?!

1000
01:27:19,275 --> 01:27:21,527
Old Lady Tsunade...

1001
01:27:25,531 --> 01:27:26,699
You're still going to get up?

1002
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:33,122
Just like our wager

1003
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:37,210
I will definitely win
that unlucky necklace from you.

1004
01:27:40,505 --> 01:27:42,131
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

1005
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:45,969
<i>Shadow Clone won't do anything now.</i>

1006
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:51,933
Enough...Don't protect me, Naruto.
Stop it!

1007
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:58,231
I told you that you'd die
if you were obstinate like that, right?

1008
01:27:58,690 --> 01:28:02,277
If you die, there will be no dreams,
no nothing.

1009
01:28:02,318 --> 01:28:05,280
Just get out of the way. Run away.

1010
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:09,784
Humph...It's okay.

1011
01:28:19,377 --> 01:28:21,504
I absolutely will not die...

1012
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:24,215
until I become the Hokage!

1013
01:28:26,050 --> 01:28:28,803
This way, I can hold on to you.
Here I go!

1014
01:28:39,731 --> 01:28:40,940
<i>Rasengan!</i>

1015
01:28:43,818 --> 01:28:44,944
<i>This is...?!</i>

1016
01:29:34,410 --> 01:29:37,205
<i>Way to go, Naruto.</i>

1017
01:29:37,997 --> 01:29:39,749
<i>That Nine-Tailed Fox kid...</i>

1018
01:29:40,124 --> 01:29:42,418
<i>a kid like that,
doing a technique like that...</i>

1019
01:29:42,919 --> 01:29:44,379
<i>I-It can't be...</i>

1020
01:29:45,421 --> 01:29:46,964
<i>He can't be, really...</i>

1021
01:30:14,826 --> 01:30:17,745
You...Even after you received
that jutsu?!

1022
01:30:20,748 --> 01:30:22,750
I gathered the chakra in my stomach,

1023
01:30:22,834 --> 01:30:25,711
and before I received the jutsu
I had started healing.

1024
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:29,799
The reason why Orochimaru favors me...

1025
01:30:30,675 --> 01:30:33,511
is not because of my use of jutsu
or my sense for jutsu...

1026
01:30:33,719 --> 01:30:36,055
It is because my recuperative power.

1027
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:43,312
The power to energize cells
and make new cells.

1028
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:48,776
<i>On the other hand...
I've used up almost all of my chakra.</i>

1029
01:30:50,153 --> 01:30:54,490
That jutsu...
seems it was Naruto's last effort...

1030
01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:06,461
<i>I-It can't be...</i>

1031
01:31:07,753 --> 01:31:12,717
<i>Even with my powers of recuperation,
this much damage.</i>

1032
01:31:14,177 --> 01:31:17,638
<i>I don't...have...enough chakra.</i>

1033
01:31:25,229 --> 01:31:26,606
Arrhythmia!

1034
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:34,489
Drats! His heart muscle is in tatters...

1035
01:31:35,114 --> 01:31:36,741
Why did that happen...?

1036
01:31:38,117 --> 01:31:39,117
<i>That moment?!</i>

1037
01:31:41,829 --> 01:31:43,206
<i>At that moment of release...</i>

1038
01:31:43,289 --> 01:31:45,958
<i>did he shred the muscles
around his heart...?</i>

1039
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:53,341
<i>Stop shaking!</i>

1040
01:32:00,556 --> 01:32:03,851
It's all over...for Naruto.

1041
01:32:06,062 --> 01:32:13,569
I...cut...his heart's chakra network
which restores the strength...

1042
01:32:13,653 --> 01:32:15,905
through the Nine-Tail's chakra...

1043
01:32:16,822 --> 01:32:18,282
With all my strength.

1044
01:32:21,410 --> 01:32:26,415
In order to eliminate the possibility
that he would heal with his own power.

1045
01:32:26,832 --> 01:32:29,585
There's no way he can recover...

1046
01:32:30,628 --> 01:32:32,338
Even with you.

1047
01:32:32,421 --> 01:32:33,422
Shut up!

1048
01:32:35,299 --> 01:32:37,176
I'll kill you later...

1049
01:32:43,599 --> 01:32:45,351
<i>He's stopped breathing...!</i>

1050
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:48,270
<i>Dammit!</i>

1051
01:32:49,105 --> 01:32:50,231
<i>Dammit!</i>

1052
01:32:50,815 --> 01:32:51,857
<i>Dammit!</i>

1053
01:33:01,534 --> 01:33:03,119
It's dark...

1054
01:33:04,161 --> 01:33:05,913
Dark!

1055
01:33:07,164 --> 01:33:09,417
Why is it getting dark?

1056
01:33:10,543 --> 01:33:14,797
My strength is...Why...?

1057
01:33:17,925 --> 01:33:19,302
What...?

1058
01:33:25,725 --> 01:33:26,725
<i>Don't die...</i>

1059
01:33:27,727 --> 01:33:28,727
<i>Don't die!</i>

1060
01:33:29,687 --> 01:33:30,813
<i>Don't die!</i>

1061
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:32,815
<i>Don't die!</i>

1062
01:33:33,566 --> 01:33:34,692
<i>Don't die!</i>

1063
01:33:44,076 --> 01:33:45,202
I won it.

1064
01:33:48,414 --> 01:33:50,249
I-It's impossible...

1065
01:34:01,761 --> 01:34:07,099
Hokage is...my dream, eh?

1066
01:34:18,402 --> 01:34:19,403
For the last time...

1067
01:34:22,114 --> 01:34:23,449
For the last time...

1068
01:34:24,325 --> 01:34:25,743
Just one more time...

1069
01:34:30,247 --> 01:34:32,124
I want to bet on you...

1070
01:34:35,753 --> 01:34:39,131
<i>Who would have imagined this?</i>

1071
01:34:39,757 --> 01:34:42,927
<i>If that child is found by the Akatsuki,
there will be trouble.</i>

1072
01:34:43,803 --> 01:34:45,930
<i>In other words,
if I'm to kill him...</i>

1073
01:34:45,971 --> 01:34:46,971
<i>now is the time!</i>

1074
01:34:55,523 --> 01:34:56,523
Shoot!

1075
01:35:07,159 --> 01:35:08,494
<i>He's aiming at this child!</i>

1076
01:35:23,968 --> 01:35:28,013
Tsunade...You're the only one
I wasn't going to kill...

1077
01:35:28,764 --> 01:35:31,016
If that child lives,

1078
01:35:31,225 --> 01:35:35,980
there will be trouble in the future
on a variety of levels.

1079
01:35:36,355 --> 01:35:38,190
Don't get in my way.

1080
01:35:39,859 --> 01:35:41,068
This is one child...

1081
01:35:43,529 --> 01:35:46,323
This is one child...
I will absolutely protect!

1082
01:35:48,868 --> 01:35:54,165
Trembling at the sight of blood,
why would you, one of the Sannin,

1083
01:35:54,457 --> 01:35:59,086
risk your life to protect that genin kid?

1084
01:36:11,724 --> 01:36:13,726
To protect...

1085
01:36:14,935 --> 01:36:17,897
my hometown...the Leaf Village...!

1086
01:36:22,902 --> 01:36:25,070
To protect the Leaf Village...?

1087
01:36:35,289 --> 01:36:38,167
Because...because...

1088
01:36:39,418 --> 01:36:41,128
this small child...

1089
01:36:42,171 --> 01:36:44,882
is the kid who will become
Hokage some day...

1090
01:36:47,593 --> 01:36:50,012
What utter nonsense...

1091
01:36:50,930 --> 01:36:54,266
By the way...
to hell with Hokage!

1092
01:36:54,975 --> 01:36:57,186
Only a fool does that job.

1093
01:36:58,938 --> 01:37:02,775
<i>To hell with Hokage!
Only a fool does that job.</i>

1094
01:37:09,907 --> 01:37:11,242
<i>The wishes of the two...</i>

1095
01:37:12,201 --> 01:37:16,247
<i>More importantly, Lady Tsunade,
your wish...</i>

1096
01:37:17,289 --> 01:37:18,916
<i>Have you forgotten your dream?</i>

1097
01:37:24,505 --> 01:37:26,632
<i>The successive lines of Hokage
have protected</i>

1098
01:37:26,715 --> 01:37:30,010
<i>the Leaf Village and
and those living in it.</i>

1099
01:37:30,344 --> 01:37:34,098
<i>They brought troubled times under control
and helped the village to prosper.</i>

1100
01:37:34,139 --> 01:37:36,934
<i>They risked their lives
for this dream, this ideal!</i>

1101
01:37:41,730 --> 01:37:45,401
<i>Anyone who makes fun of the old man
and the Fourth Hokage...</i>

1102
01:37:45,484 --> 01:37:47,778
<i>It doesn't matter if
you are a woman!</i>

1103
01:37:48,153 --> 01:37:50,114
<i>I'll clobber you with all my might!</i>

1104
01:38:00,749 --> 01:38:05,337
And now,
I also will put my life on the line!

1105
01:38:08,841 --> 01:38:12,887
If your life is worth throwing away
for a kid like him...!

1106
01:38:13,512 --> 01:38:16,724
Then dying now would be
a fitting end!

1107
01:38:32,865 --> 01:38:35,659
All that's left...is Naruto.

1108
01:38:36,619 --> 01:38:37,703
Lady Tsunade!

1109
01:38:51,467 --> 01:38:54,762
<i>She's still able to move even
after I pierced her down to her lungs!</i>

1110
01:38:59,099 --> 01:39:01,977
You mean you'll still protect that kid?!

1111
01:39:05,814 --> 01:39:07,274
That's what I said...

1112
01:39:07,942 --> 01:39:08,984
From now...

1113
01:39:11,487 --> 01:39:13,572
I'm putting my life on the line!

1114
01:39:15,115 --> 01:39:17,076
You, half dead corpse!

1115
01:39:30,839 --> 01:39:35,761
No matter how cool you try to be,
your trembling doesn't stop.

1116
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:40,224
You can't get away from
the curse of hemophobia.

1117
01:39:41,350 --> 01:39:47,147
And yet, why would you
take the blows for that kid?

1118
01:39:47,856 --> 01:39:51,777
Why would you battle for the Leaf?

1119
01:40:02,997 --> 01:40:03,997
No way!

1120
01:40:04,373 --> 01:40:06,208
Tsunade's trembling has...

1121
01:40:06,875 --> 01:40:07,876
has stopped?

1122
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:12,673
That is because...I am...

1123
01:40:17,302 --> 01:40:21,098
the Leaf Village's...Fifth Hokage!

1124
01:40:22,683 --> 01:40:23,684
That sign is?!

1125
01:40:25,519 --> 01:40:27,730
<i>Lady Tsunade has conquered
her fear of blood,</i>

1126
01:40:27,813 --> 01:40:29,106
<i>but that's...</i>

1127
01:40:32,359 --> 01:40:38,907
W-Wait! I'll treat that wound.
So don't release that seal!

1128
01:40:42,119 --> 01:40:43,787
<i>Secret Seal Release!</i>

1129
01:40:44,329 --> 01:40:47,541
<i>Ninja Art: Mitotic Regeneration!</i>

1130
01:40:58,594 --> 01:41:00,137
<i>What is this jutsu...?!</i>

1131
01:41:05,309 --> 01:41:10,022
It looks like I'm not the only one
who develops new jutsu.

1132
01:41:10,564 --> 01:41:13,650
What in the world is this jutsu?

1133
01:41:14,318 --> 01:41:15,318
Well...

1134
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:20,032
For many years I've stored chakra
in my forehead.

1135
01:41:21,325 --> 01:41:25,370
The mass of chakra stimulated
a variety of proteins.

1136
01:41:25,704 --> 01:41:28,999
The number of times my cells divide
speeds to a dizzying rate...

1137
01:41:29,666 --> 01:41:31,335
The cells rebuild...

1138
01:41:32,044 --> 01:41:36,256
and all the organs and body systems
are revitalized.

1139
01:41:36,882 --> 01:41:40,135
It's not the ability to restore,
it's the ability to reincarnate.

1140
01:41:40,803 --> 01:41:44,306
That means I won't die...from battles.

1141
01:41:46,683 --> 01:41:50,854
<i>But the number of times a person's cells
divide in their lifetime is fixed...</i>

1142
01:41:51,355 --> 01:41:56,110
<i>If that is sped up,
it essentially shortens the life!</i>

1143
01:41:59,113 --> 01:42:00,239
Lady Tsunade!

1144
01:42:01,949 --> 01:42:02,950
<i>That action is...</i>

1145
01:42:03,826 --> 01:42:05,202
Lord Orochimaru!

1146
01:42:08,038 --> 01:42:09,540
<i>Come out!</i>

1147
01:42:11,208 --> 01:42:12,292
Hurry!

1148
01:42:13,585 --> 01:42:15,504
Ino, inu, saru, tori, hitsuji!

1149
01:42:18,090 --> 01:42:19,550
<i>- Summoning Jutsu!
- Summoning Jutsu!</i>

1150
01:42:43,532 --> 01:42:44,908
Oh! Dad!

1151
01:42:54,877 --> 01:42:55,877
This isn't good!

1152
01:42:56,295 --> 01:42:58,922
Oh no, Gamatatsu!
Let's get out of here!

1153
01:42:59,173 --> 01:43:01,216
What? Why, why?

1154
01:43:01,550 --> 01:43:03,010
It doesn't matter, just hurry up!

1155
01:43:13,478 --> 01:43:17,399
Manda and Orochimaru,
Katsuyu and Tsunade...

1156
01:43:18,108 --> 01:43:21,195
They all bring back memories...

1157
01:43:25,741 --> 01:43:30,204
Shall we have a reunion
or something, Jiraiya?

1158
01:43:30,579 --> 01:43:33,832
Fool! I summon you after a long absence

1159
01:43:33,916 --> 01:43:36,210
and you make these boring jokes.

1160
01:43:37,044 --> 01:43:40,505
The time to conclude this long,
fateful confrontation has come.

1161
01:43:41,757 --> 01:43:45,427
I'm bringing Orochimaru down,
here and now!

1162
01:43:48,138 --> 01:43:49,806
Hey Orochimaru...

1163
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:54,603
Why'd you have to summon me
to a place like this?!

1164
01:44:00,525 --> 01:44:02,778
You...I'm going to eat you up!

1165
01:44:02,945 --> 01:44:05,113
Don't say that, Lord Manda...

1166
01:44:05,781 --> 01:44:07,199
You will be duly rewarded.

1167
01:44:07,282 --> 01:44:10,077
Who said I'm talking to you?!

1168
01:44:10,327 --> 01:44:14,331
Don't be so flippant, brat!

1169
01:44:18,502 --> 01:44:20,128
Hey, Orochimaru...

1170
01:44:20,254 --> 01:44:24,758
I expect you to prepare
a sacrificial offering of 100 people later

1171
01:44:28,262 --> 01:44:29,781
<i>Though Lord Orochimaru is
Manda's master,</i>

1172
01:44:29,805 --> 01:44:32,391
<i>if Manda learns that Lord Orochimaru
can't use jutsu,</i>

1173
01:44:32,557 --> 01:44:34,685
<i>Manda will no doubt
double cross him.</i>

1174
01:44:35,811 --> 01:44:39,189
<i>Despite the fact that he had
no other choice, in his condition,</i>

1175
01:44:39,273 --> 01:44:41,733
<i>it was too risky for Lord Orochimaru
to summon Manda.</i>

1176
01:44:42,526 --> 01:44:46,363
Katsuyu...take that kid to Shizune!

1177
01:44:46,947 --> 01:44:48,573
Yes, ma'am.

1178
01:44:59,835 --> 01:45:01,503
All right! I can fight, too!

1179
01:45:04,923 --> 01:45:07,718
Shizune, please take care of this child.

1180
01:45:09,303 --> 01:45:10,303
Naruto...

1181
01:45:11,013 --> 01:45:14,599
Also, the battle is going to get
quite vicious from now.

1182
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:19,813
Please go far away with my clone
and conceal yourself...

1183
01:45:21,356 --> 01:45:23,942
That's what Lady Tsunade wants.

1184
01:45:26,028 --> 01:45:27,028
<i>Lady Tsunade...</i>

1185
01:45:42,753 --> 01:45:43,837
You...

1186
01:45:44,588 --> 01:45:48,091
I'll hang you out until you're dry!

1187
01:45:48,717 --> 01:45:53,263
I've been wanting a snakeskin wallet...

1188
01:45:57,225 --> 01:46:01,146
Orochimaru,
you've sunk too deeply into vice!

1189
01:46:01,521 --> 01:46:03,899
We are no longer comrades.

1190
01:46:04,358 --> 01:46:05,525
Comrades?

1191
01:46:07,778 --> 01:46:09,404
That word makes me shiver.

1192
01:46:09,738 --> 01:46:12,282
Today is the last day that
we are called Sannin!

1193
01:46:30,258 --> 01:46:31,259
<i>Acid Slime!</i>

1194
01:46:38,725 --> 01:46:40,352
I'll start with this one!

1195
01:46:44,815 --> 01:46:45,816
Katsuyu!

1196
01:46:45,899 --> 01:46:46,942
Lady Tsunade...

1197
01:47:06,169 --> 01:47:07,003
Here they come!

1198
01:47:07,087 --> 01:47:08,255
I know!

1199
01:47:18,056 --> 01:47:19,766
Tsunade! Stay away!

1200
01:47:20,434 --> 01:47:22,394
Bunta! Give me some oil!

1201
01:47:22,644 --> 01:47:24,104
Okay!

1202
01:47:28,191 --> 01:47:29,109
<i>Fire Style:</i>

1203
01:47:29,192 --> 01:47:31,236
<i>Toad Oil Flamethrower!</i>

1204
01:47:45,750 --> 01:47:47,586
Humph...How's that?

1205
01:47:47,794 --> 01:47:48,794
Did it work?

1206
01:47:53,717 --> 01:47:55,177
No, that's...

1207
01:48:01,183 --> 01:48:04,478
<i>Molten skin! He shed his skin!</i>

1208
01:48:05,187 --> 01:48:07,189
Bunta! Under the earth!

1209
01:48:07,230 --> 01:48:08,231
What?!

1210
01:48:11,693 --> 01:48:12,693
It's the tail?!

1211
01:48:20,577 --> 01:48:21,577
Keep it shut!

1212
01:48:24,164 --> 01:48:25,499
<i>They're Sannin, all right.</i>

1213
01:48:25,582 --> 01:48:27,584
<i>Dealing with two of them is rough.</i>

1214
01:48:32,506 --> 01:48:35,509
Well now, I can kill you
by wringing your neck.

1215
01:48:41,139 --> 01:48:42,139
Fine!

1216
01:48:42,724 --> 01:48:45,227
It's about time we put an end to this!

1217
01:48:48,396 --> 01:48:49,396
<i>R-Ridiculous!</i>

1218
01:49:02,536 --> 01:49:04,246
<i>He took a direct hit!</i>

1219
01:49:06,414 --> 01:49:08,250
That was it.

1220
01:49:08,416 --> 01:49:09,417
Yeah...

1221
01:49:14,089 --> 01:49:15,423
Lord Orochimaru...

1222
01:49:19,469 --> 01:49:21,221
Putting me in this position!

1223
01:49:21,555 --> 01:49:24,140
I want to eat you and kill you,

1224
01:49:24,224 --> 01:49:27,727
but I can't even chew you up
with this hole in my mouth...

1225
01:49:28,979 --> 01:49:32,482
Next time, if we meet again,
be prepared!

1226
01:49:41,908 --> 01:49:43,118
Tsunade...

1227
01:49:43,243 --> 01:49:49,332
Even though you won't heal me,
I still have one way.

1228
01:49:56,881 --> 01:50:00,510
A way to resurrect these arms.

1229
01:50:07,892 --> 01:50:11,563
The Leaf Village...
I'll destroy it...without fail.

1230
01:50:14,733 --> 01:50:17,527
At that time, it would be nice
if we could meet again...

1231
01:50:18,153 --> 01:50:24,618
My comrades...
Tsunade and Jiraiya.

1232
01:50:26,911 --> 01:50:27,954
<i>That face...?!</i>

1233
01:50:30,123 --> 01:50:33,293
<i>In some way or another,
he took someone else's body...?!</i>

1234
01:50:34,836 --> 01:50:36,713
<i>No wonder,
when we went at it a while ago,</i>

1235
01:50:36,796 --> 01:50:40,175
<i>I didn't get the same feeling
from him that I did in the past...</i>

1236
01:50:44,346 --> 01:50:46,306
The true elixir of life.

1237
01:50:46,556 --> 01:50:48,183
That's my...

1238
01:50:48,558 --> 01:50:50,310
my immortality!

1239
01:50:53,021 --> 01:50:54,522
Some day, in the future...

1240
01:50:59,361 --> 01:51:00,361
Wait!

1241
01:51:03,365 --> 01:51:06,201
<i>The bones in my ribs and feet
are broken...</i>

1242
01:51:12,749 --> 01:51:15,168
<i>The side effects of the jutsu
are starting...</i>

1243
01:51:18,421 --> 01:51:20,423
<i>My body is...already...</i>

1244
01:51:47,742 --> 01:51:51,871
Tsunade, you haven't changed.
You're no good at wagers.

1245
01:51:58,545 --> 01:52:00,046
Any time now, the side effects...

1246
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:01,880
Lady Tsunade...

1247
01:52:08,012 --> 01:52:09,097
You...

1248
01:52:10,223 --> 01:52:15,353
It's nothing...If I rest a bit, I'll retu
to my young form.

1249
01:52:16,146 --> 01:52:17,731
I'll rest in town.

1250
01:52:17,897 --> 01:52:21,109
And when Naruto wakes up,
We'll return to Konoha.

1251
01:52:21,651 --> 01:52:22,652
Tsunade...

1252
01:52:24,154 --> 01:52:27,449
Starting now, don't call me Tsunade.
Call me...

1253
01:52:28,908 --> 01:52:31,286
The Fifth Hokage?!

1254
01:52:34,330 --> 01:52:38,460
Old Lady Tsunade is
the Fifth Hokage starting today...

1255
01:52:39,169 --> 01:52:42,464
What, you look disgruntled, Naruto.

1256
01:52:42,756 --> 01:52:46,259
After all, compared to the old man,
the Third Hokage

1257
01:52:46,384 --> 01:52:48,219
there's something...

1258
01:52:49,304 --> 01:52:52,140
rough natured and kind of selfish...

1259
01:52:52,307 --> 01:52:55,185
Ioose with money, catty and stupid...

1260
01:52:56,269 --> 01:53:00,899
Somehow, I'm going to worry
if she can do it properly.

1261
01:53:01,316 --> 01:53:05,278
Lady Tsunade, would you like
to order something...

1262
01:53:05,570 --> 01:53:09,616
Moreover, a 50 year old lady
transforming into a young lady...

1263
01:53:10,492 --> 01:53:12,702
Is it okay for the person who
will become Hokage

1264
01:53:12,786 --> 01:53:14,537
to lie to everyone, I wonder?

1265
01:53:16,372 --> 01:53:17,957
Go outside, brat!

1266
01:53:23,213 --> 01:53:26,674
<i>It's just like before...</i>

1267
01:53:36,476 --> 01:53:40,063
Despite how I look,
I'm going to be the Fifth Hokage.

1268
01:53:40,855 --> 01:53:43,775
I shouldn't take
this short brat of a foe seriously...

1269
01:53:46,236 --> 01:53:48,196
This one is enough...

1270
01:53:48,655 --> 01:53:51,324
Don't call me brat!

1271
01:53:51,783 --> 01:53:55,370
I may be like this now,
but I'll be Hokage some day!

1272
01:54:11,594 --> 01:54:12,762
Here I go!

1273
01:54:20,895 --> 01:54:22,105
<i>Another brow flick?!</i>

1274
01:54:46,337 --> 01:54:48,172
Become a fine man...

1275
01:54:50,675 --> 01:54:53,428
<i>And, a fine Hokage.</i>

1276
01:54:58,850 --> 01:54:59,850
Yeah!

1277
01:55:13,698 --> 01:55:15,533
Okay! Shall we go home?

1278
01:55:15,575 --> 01:55:17,035
To our hometown the Leaf Village!

1279
01:55:17,160 --> 01:55:20,038
What? I haven't eaten yet...!

1280
01:55:22,540 --> 01:55:24,208
Don't try to distract me by laughing

1281
01:55:45,063 --> 01:55:47,106
<i>Nawaki...Dan...</i>

1282
01:55:52,612 --> 01:55:55,573
<i>the boy who will inherit your dreams,
my beloved ones,</i>

1283
01:55:58,576 --> 01:55:59,911
<i>is right here!</i>
