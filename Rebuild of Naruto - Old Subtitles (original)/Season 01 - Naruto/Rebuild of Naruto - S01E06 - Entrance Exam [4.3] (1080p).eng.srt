1
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,232
Here we go!

2
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,986
I'm gonna take care of
my duties with gusto again today!

3
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,780
Whoa! Mach 5!

4
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:55,175
Oh!

5
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,594
Good morning, Sakura!

6
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,271
Hmph!

7
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,065
<i>Oh, not again!</i>

8
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,609
<i>These two...</i>

9
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:16,362
<i>They've been sort of strange since
we got back from the Land of Waves...</i>

10
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,199
Well...
Good morning, everyone...

11
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,285
Today I got lost.

12
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:23,453
Hey!

13
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,249
Hey, hey...
Kakashi Sensei!

14
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,794
Our Squad Seven always has
the easy missions lately!

15
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:36,507
Aren't there more exciting
missions where I can be more active,

16
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:40,970
where I can use my way of the ninja
and my soul...you know?

17
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,555
Oh yes yes...

18
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,757
I basically understand what
you're trying to say.

19
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:52,941
<i>Shoot!</i>

20
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,069
<i>He's always making me
indebted to him</i>

21
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,613
<i>and making himself look good
during our missions!</i>

22
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,990
<i>I won't lose, no way!</i>

23
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,497
<i>You little...!</i>

24
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,418
<i>Today for sure!</i>

25
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:25,682
<i>Hmm...
You are so much trouble!</i>

26
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,519
That's what I'd like to say!

27
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,356
Hey! What're you doing, Naruto?
We're going on our mission!

28
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,691
Okay!

29
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:40,780
Well! It's because you're so reckless!

30
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:44,117
Geez, you are so much trouble.

31
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,539
Zazuge!

32
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,127
If you act up any more, I'll finish you!

33
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:59,507
Mmm...
Teamwork hasn't been good lately.

34
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,592
That's right, that's right!

35
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,304
Sasuke, you're to blame for
the poor teamwork!

36
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,389
You're always attracting attention!

37
00:05:06,749 --> 00:05:09,058
That's you, you idiot.

38
00:05:09,758 --> 00:05:12,553
If you don't want to owe me
big time...

39
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,567
you just need to become
stronger than me!

40
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:23,448
<i>It seems like they're getting
along worse than before...</i>

41
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,622
<i>Shoot...
This is frustrating!</i>

42
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:35,918
<i>There're plenty of guys outside
who are stronger than I am...</i>

43
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,297
<i>Always making me go on
this kind of lame mission.</i>

44
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,681
Well then...

45
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,726
Perhaps we should disperse.

46
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:57,231
I do need to submit a report
about this mission.

47
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,359
Okay, then I'm going home.

48
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,152
Oh! Hey!

49
00:06:01,536 --> 00:06:07,500
Sakura! Just let Sasuke be,
and let's practice together!

50
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,245
Huh?

51
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,581
<i>Sensei disappeared.</i>

52
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,833
<i>Was he being thoughtful?</i>

53
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:31,015
There's no such thing as a perfectly
square rock with perfect holes!

54
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,058
It's totally obvious!

55
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,604
Just what you'd expect from
the man I respect!

56
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,689
You are my rival, aren't you!

57
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,200
Hey! That's too much gunpowder!

58
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,870
I knew it was Konohamaru
and friends.

59
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:57,750
Huh? Why are you all wearing goggles?

60
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,672
We're just copying what
you used to do, bro!

61
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,173
Oh...

62
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,926
What's with the oh!

63
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,971
Your reactions have been
pretty cold these days!

64
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,016
So, did you want something?

65
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,726
See? Cold.

66
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,563
So, leader!
Do you have some free time now?

67
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,314
Nah!

68
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,651
I have to train!

69
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:28,339
What?! You said you'd
play ninja with us today!

70
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,492
Oh...? Is that right?

71
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:35,496
Hmph! Why would a ninja play ninja?

72
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:45,381
<i>You are making me blush
with those stares...</i>

73
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,039
<i>She's been staring at him with eyes
like she's gonna kill him!</i>

74
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:55,475
Oh!

75
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,962
You've been busier
than I thought, bro...

76
00:07:59,103 --> 00:07:59,728
Huh?

77
00:07:59,945 --> 00:08:01,655
Is she your?

78
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:04,525
This?

79
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:11,032
Shucks, you guys are
pretty sharp for kids!

80
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,536
Bro!

81
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:19,081
What are you doing?!

82
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,443
No! Leader!

83
00:08:22,651 --> 00:08:24,903
His pulse, his pulse...!

84
00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:30,859
You ugly wench! Ugly wench!

85
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:32,887
Huh?!

86
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,144
Nooooo!

87
00:08:45,607 --> 00:08:47,859
So, I have formally received
the report from you.

88
00:08:49,594 --> 00:08:53,181
Is Naruto getting along with the others?

89
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,033
Hmm?

90
00:08:55,676 --> 00:08:57,928
Well, he's doing okay.

91
00:08:58,486 --> 00:09:00,488
I've been busy lately.

92
00:09:02,057 --> 00:09:05,644
I haven't had a chance to see him
even once since his return.

93
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,913
I'm a little concerned...

94
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:15,662
As you know, Iruka Sensei,
Sasuke is also in our squad,

95
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,975
and Naruto sees him as a rival,
which is a little straining.

96
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:24,129
But, the result is that his abilities
are developing significantly.

97
00:09:24,913 --> 00:09:27,164
Almost to the point that
he might surpass you!

98
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,443
I see...

99
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,657
Are you all right, Konohamaru?

100
00:09:36,044 --> 00:09:38,828
Oweee...

101
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,250
Darn that broad foreheaded ugly wench!
Is she a girl for real?

102
00:09:57,186 --> 00:09:58,521
Yikes!

103
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,090
That hurt...

104
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,041
<i>I wonder what it is?</i>

105
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:30,512
<i>Shoot!</i>

106
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,757
<i>Right now?</i>

107
00:10:35,967 --> 00:10:38,094
That hurt, little punk!

108
00:10:39,103 --> 00:10:42,774
Stop that. You'll get yelled at later!

109
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,919
I'm sorry...
I was fooling around...

110
00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:48,955
Hey stop!
Let go of that hand!

111
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:53,736
<i>Huh! So these are Leaf Village's genin...</i>

112
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,332
Let's play with them before
the strict one comes around.

113
00:10:58,556 --> 00:11:00,359
Let go!

114
00:11:01,626 --> 00:11:04,087
You're pretty lively,
you little punk...

115
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,542
You jerk!

116
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,514
Wha?!
What was that?

117
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:26,518
Leaf Village's genin are
weaker than I thought.

118
00:11:27,911 --> 00:11:29,746
<i>T-These guys are foreign...</i>

119
00:11:30,497 --> 00:11:31,832
<i>Why are they here?</i>

120
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,111
Konohamaru...

121
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:41,174
Hey! If you don't let go of him,
I won't forgive you! You fool!

122
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,661
You're the fool!

123
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,913
What are you gonna do
by getting him worked up!

124
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,133
You're ticking me off.

125
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,520
It's not on me.

126
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:57,007
Well, after this little squirt,
it's the little runt that won't shut up!

127
00:11:58,843 --> 00:11:59,844
You!

128
00:12:10,328 --> 00:12:13,414
What do you think you're doing
in someone else's Village, you...

129
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,154
Sasuke!

130
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,161
<i>He's pretty cute.</i>

131
00:12:26,653 --> 00:12:28,739
Another little punk to tick me off!

132
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,169
Get lost!

133
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,839
Wow! So cool!

134
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,970
Naruto, you're lame!

135
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:47,641
S-Stupid! I would've quickly
taken down that thug too!

136
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:48,434
Hmph!

137
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,103
<i>Sasuke, you!</i>

138
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:55,649
<i>Why're you always,
always meddling like this!</i>

139
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,903
Hey, come down here,
you little punk!

140
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:05,409
You're the kind of smart aleck
little punk that I despise the most.

141
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,122
Wait! You aren't thinking of
using Crow, are you?!

142
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,790
Kankuro, stop that.

143
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:21,717
<i>Huh?</i>

144
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,991
You're an embarrassment
to our village.

145
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,727
Why do you think we came all
the way here to Leaf Village!?

146
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,813
P-Please listen to me, Gaara.

147
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,566
T-They lashed out first...

148
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,734
Shut up!

149
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:42,905
I'll kill you.

150
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:46,575
U-Understood, I was wrong.

151
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,245
I-I'm sorry...
I'm really sorry.

152
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,998
I'm sorry about that...

153
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,253
<i>This guy...has a nasty look.</i>

154
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,047
<i>To think he was able to hit
that Kankuro</i>

155
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,091
<i>with a tiny rock with great ease.</i>

156
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,844
<i>This guy's...good.</i>

157
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:11,267
Let's go.

158
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,978
We didn't come here
to play around.

159
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,604
I know.

160
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,231
Hold it!

161
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:18,357
What is it?

162
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,276
Judging from your headbands,

163
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:23,028
you're ninja from the Village
Hidden in the Sand, right?

164
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,907
Without question, the Land of Fire and
the Land of Wind are allied nations.

165
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,826
But the arbitrary coming and
going of shinobi

166
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,661
is supposed to
be prohibited by the treaty.

167
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,663
State your purpose!

168
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,248
Depending on circumstances...

169
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,958
Don't you know anything about it?

170
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,127
My permit!

171
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,505
We came to this villagerto
take the Chunin Exam.

172
00:14:42,822 --> 00:14:45,992
What is the Chunin Exam anyways?

173
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,554
You really don't know
anything, do you?

174
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:54,602
Bro, if you pass the exam,
you can become a chunin from a genin!

175
00:14:54,876 --> 00:14:57,837
I see! Then, maybe I'll try taking them!

176
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:58,772
Heh!

177
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,984
Hey! You there...

178
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,694
What's your name?

179
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,446
Huh? M-Me?

180
00:15:05,747 --> 00:15:08,490
No! The gourd next to you!

181
00:15:10,801 --> 00:15:13,260
I'm Gaara of the desert...

182
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,956
I have an interest in you as well...

183
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:17,625
What's your name?

184
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,127
Sasuke Uchiha.

185
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,845
Say! Say! What about me?
What about me?

186
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,805
Not interested.

187
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:38,228
<i>Heh! Things have gotten interesting.</i>

188
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:42,942
Konohamaru, do I look weak?

189
00:15:43,084 --> 00:15:45,694
Compared to Sasuke, yes...

190
00:15:47,772 --> 00:15:49,823
Sasuke, I won't lose to you!

191
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,408
What's gotten into you,
all of a sudden?!

192
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:52,993
What do you think?

193
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,996
I don't think they're anything special.

194
00:15:56,325 --> 00:15:59,124
But the black-haired one from Leaf Village
and the gourd from the Sand Village...

195
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,126
those two need to be checked.

196
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,883
Now then, in conjunction
with beginning the Chunin Exam,

197
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:12,262
let us first have those in charge
of the rookie genin come forward.

198
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:17,059
Kakashi and Kurenai and Asuma...

199
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,938
So? Are there any genin from
your squads

200
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:24,650
you wish to recommend
for these exams?

201
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,820
It goes without saying,

202
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:32,199
but if it's a genin who has carried out
eight or more formal missions,

203
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:35,536
you can recommend them
for the exams if you wish.

204
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,705
Then, you first Kakashi.

205
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,541
The Kakashi led Squad Seven...

206
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:45,713
Sasuke Uchiha. Naruto Uzumaki.
Sakura Haruno.

207
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:52,428
I, Kakashi Hatake, recommend these
three for the Chunin Exam.

208
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:53,804
Huh?

209
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,557
The Kurenai led Squad Eight...

210
00:16:56,724 --> 00:17:00,894
Hinata Hyuga, Kiba Inuzuka,
Shino Aburame.

211
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:05,149
These three, I, Kurenai Yuhi,
recommend the same.

212
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,235
The Asuma led Squad Ten...

213
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:13,198
Ino Yamanaka, Shikamaru Nara,
Choji Akimichi.

214
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,786
These three, I, Asuma Sarutobi,
recommend the same.

215
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,039
All three recommended...

216
00:17:20,064 --> 00:17:21,983
To think rookies will be
in the Chunin Exam...

217
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,083
Hasn't it been five years
since that's happened?

218
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,335
Hmm...

219
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,695
Wait a minute!

220
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,422
What is it, Iruka?

221
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,091
Lord Hokage, please let me
say one thing.

222
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,177
This may be presumptuous,

223
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,471
but as for the nine names
that were given,

224
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,723
I was in charge of them at the Academy.

225
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,101
Admittedly, they were all students
with ability,

226
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,519
but it's too soon...!

227
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,440
They should be tested after
having gained more experience!

228
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:51,904
I became a chunin when I was
six years younger than Naruto is now.

229
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,989
Naruto is different from you!

230
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,533
Is it your intent to crush Naruto?!

231
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:00,496
They always do nothing but complain
about important missions...

232
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,499
Teaching them a lesson
once would be fun.

233
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:05,884
Trying to crush them
would be interesting, too.

234
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,961
W-What did you say?!

235
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,881
Well, joking aside...

236
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,050
Iruka Sensei...

237
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,259
Kakashi...

238
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,677
Don't do it.

239
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:20,599
Stay out of this!
They're not your students anymore!

240
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:23,602
Now they're my subordinates!

241
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:28,482
Man...troublesome people.

242
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,736
B-But the Chunin Exam
is also known as...

243
00:18:32,761 --> 00:18:33,595
Iruka...

244
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:37,407
I understand your point.

245
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,576
Master Hokage...

246
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,830
Therefore, I have decided to conduct

247
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,749
a special preliminary exam
for these rookie genin.

248
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,585
P-Preliminary exam?!

249
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,302
Say! Say! Say!

250
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,513
Why is it that he's the one who
always calls us out,

251
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:00,956
and then makes us wait?!

252
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,391
That's right! That's right!

253
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,810
What's he going to do about
the feelings of a maiden

254
00:19:04,835 --> 00:19:07,546
who accidentally overslept and resigned
herself to no blow drying?!

255
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:11,483
I overslept, so I haven't washed my face
and didn't brush my teeth.

256
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:15,821
Y-You...That's dirty.

257
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:20,033
<i>Why're these guys so hyper
first thing in the morning?!</i>

258
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,787
Hey, good morning, folks!

259
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,249
Today, I got a bit lost on the
path of life...

260
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,792
Right! That's a lie!!

261
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:31,712
Uh, well...

262
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:36,133
This is sudden, but I recommended
you guys for the Chunin Exam, so...

263
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,177
Here, these are your applications.

264
00:19:38,652 --> 00:19:39,986
Chunin Exam...

265
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:43,473
That being said, the recommendations
are not compulsory.

266
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:47,144
You guys are free to decide whether
you take the Exam or not.

267
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:50,147
All right! I love you, Kakashi Sensei!

268
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,940
Hey, cut it out. Get away already...

269
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,861
Only those who want to take the Exam,
sign that application and

270
00:19:55,944 --> 00:20:00,240
come to Room 301 of the Academy
at 3:00 p.m. Five days from now...

271
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:01,566
That's it!

272
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,581
<i>Chunin Exams, eh...</i>

273
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:11,251
<i>I bet lots of strong guys would be there..</i>

274
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,921
<i>For example, that guy!</i>

275
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,216
<i>And this guy!</i>

276
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,553
<i>I might be able to fight him.</i>

277
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,271
<i>I...don't want to...</i>

278
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,358
<i>Here I can't...</i>

279
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,944
<i>keep up with Sasuke,
and not even with Naruto...</i>

280
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,654
<i>The Chunin Exam, no way...</i>

281
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,136
Sakura, you're late!

282
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,889
Yeah...sorry...

283
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,809
Morning, Sasuke.

284
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,018
Yeah...

285
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,772
<i>Something's strange about Sakura.</i>

286
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,323
So, are you sure you're going
to attempt taking

287
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,866
the Chunin Exam with that skill?

288
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,661
May it'd be best if you runts quit.

289
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,205
You're green assed brats, after all.

290
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,875
Please let us through.

291
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:39,881
That's...mean...

292
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,509
What did you say?!

293
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:46,179
Listen!
We're being nice to you!

294
00:21:46,354 --> 00:21:48,439
The Chunin Exam is a high hurdle.

295
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,393
Many times have we seen
people quit shinobi

296
00:21:51,418 --> 00:21:54,463
as well as people who were
disabled for life

297
00:21:54,997 --> 00:21:57,374
just because they took this Exam.

298
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,401
<i>A brat such as this a chunin?</i>

299
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:04,948
What's so bad about weeding out
those who won't pass anyway?!

300
00:22:05,582 --> 00:22:06,917
A just argument.

301
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,786
However, you will let me through.

302
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:15,375
And could you also immediately
undo this barrier created with genjutsu?

303
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,003
I have business on the third floor.

304
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,130
What's this guy talking about...?

305
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,590
I don't know...

306
00:22:22,056 --> 00:22:24,892
- Well, well...
- So you noticed, eh?

307
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,612
How about it, Sakura?

308
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,265
You should've been
the first one to realize it.

309
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,099
Huh?

310
00:22:31,198 --> 00:22:33,744
Your analytical strength and
genjutsu know how

311
00:22:34,301 --> 00:22:37,429
has improved the most in our squad, so...

312
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:38,899
Thank you...

313
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:42,444
Of course. I realized it ages ago!

314
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,571
You see, this is the second floor!

315
00:22:44,855 --> 00:22:45,522
Yup!

316
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:53,163
Well, not bad...
But all you've done is to catch on.

317
00:22:54,214 --> 00:22:54,840
Right?!

318
00:23:02,513 --> 00:23:03,264
<i>H-He's fast!</i>

319
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:04,883
<i>This person...</i>

320
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,761
<i>He's a different person from
when he was getting punched before!</i>

321
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,056
<i>He stopped my kick...</i>

322
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:13,308
<i>What's with that chakra in his arm?</i>

323
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,395
Hey, this isn't what you promised.

324
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,146
You were the one who said

325
00:23:18,171 --> 00:23:20,798
you didn't want to carelessly
attract attention and be watched.

326
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,025
But...

327
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:24,361
<i>This guy...</i>

328
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,322
<i>The marks where he was hit
are disappearing.</i>

329
00:23:27,972 --> 00:23:28,848
<i>Was he faking?</i>

330
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:35,705
My name's Rock Lee.
Your name's Sakura, right...?

331
00:23:36,723 --> 00:23:37,307
Huh?

332
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:42,670
Please go out with me!
I'll protect you until I die!

333
00:23:44,939 --> 00:23:46,733
Absolutely...not.

334
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:49,136
Huh?

335
00:23:50,644 --> 00:23:52,271
You're...too intense.

336
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,434
Hey, you there.

337
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:56,852
Identify yourself.

338
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,020
I'm not obliged to answer...

339
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:00,605
What...?!

340
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,191
<i>Cute...</i>

341
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:08,071
So those are Kakashi and
Guy's treasured brats...

342
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:12,242
Well, for the time being,
their applications will pass.

343
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:13,493
Yeah...

344
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:18,039
It appears this year's
test takers will be amusing.

345
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,376
For us proctors too, eh...

346
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,088
Now then!
Sasuke, Naruto, let's go!

347
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:26,756
Don't pull.

348
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:37,184
<i>Sasuke...Sasuke Uchiha, eh.</i>

349
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:40,770
Hmph...

350
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,528
Lee, let's go.

351
00:24:48,836 --> 00:24:50,295
What're you doing?

352
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:54,951
You guys go on ahead.
I have something I want to check out.

353
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,374
You, with the unpleasant look.
Wait a minute!

354
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:03,877
Huh?

355
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:10,467
- Oh!
- Yikes!

356
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:13,803
What is it?

357
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,932
Why don't you fight with me
here now?

358
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,440
My name's Rock Lee.

359
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,610
When asking a person their name,

360
00:25:28,934 --> 00:25:31,145
I'm supposed to give
my own name first, right?

361
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:32,781
Sasuke Uchiha...

362
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:35,742
Hmph...So you knew?

363
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:38,954
I want to fight with you!

364
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:44,125
I want to test out how effective
my techniques will be

365
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:48,380
against the descendant of the
clan reputed for genius ninja.

366
00:25:49,405 --> 00:25:50,072
Also...

367
00:25:55,345 --> 00:26:00,225
Noooo!
Those lower eyelashes are awful!

368
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,185
The hairstyle is awful, too!

369
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:05,313
Those bushy eyebrows,
just too intense!

370
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,523
Everything is!

371
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,025
You're an angel!

372
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:13,780
Noooooo!

373
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:19,286
You are good at it.
Then, how about?

374
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,346
<i>Really...That was super close.</i>

375
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:41,725
You! Don't throw strange stuff!

376
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,227
I was dodging for my life!

377
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:47,772
You don't have to resent me that much.

378
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:52,378
<i>It's Sasuke again!
Darn it! Darn it!</i>

379
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:55,405
To be honest, you're a naive one,

380
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:58,908
knowing the name of Uchiha
and challenging me.

381
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:04,414
Do you want to realize
what this name is, Bushy Brow?

382
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,250
I insist.

383
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:09,794
Wait!

384
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,510
I am going to take out
the Bushy Brow. Believe it!

385
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,347
Hey, you!

386
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,431
Big deal.

387
00:27:21,456 --> 00:27:23,592
I'll be able to take care of him
in just five minutes!

388
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:27,854
The one I want to fight isn't you...
It's Uchiha.

389
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,690
All these people...

390
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,485
keep saying Sasuke, Sasuke.
How annoying!

391
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,992
Darn it!

392
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,203
<i>Leaf Whirlwind!</i>

393
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:52,837
I declare. You are absolutely
no match for me.

394
00:27:53,404 --> 00:27:54,363
Because...

395
00:27:55,799 --> 00:28:00,387
among the Leaf Village genin,
I'm the strongest now.

396
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:05,100
Interesting. I'll do it.

397
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:08,728
Stop! Sasuke!

398
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:12,732
There's less than thirty minutes
until the 3:00 registration.

399
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,235
Don't worry.

400
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,488
It'll be over in five minutes.

401
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:20,844
<i>Here he comes!</i>

402
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,038
<i>I can't get completely out
of the way...</i>

403
00:28:27,063 --> 00:28:27,730
<i>Guard!</i>

404
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:30,583
<i>What...?!</i>

405
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:39,467
<i>W-What's going on?</i>

406
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,222
<i>But...he did guard himself
just now, no mistake.</i>

407
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,684
<i>He got around my guard.</i>

408
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,060
<i>What is it?</i>

409
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,813
<i>Is it ninjutsu...?
Or is it genjutsu...?!</i>

410
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:55,024
<i>As I thought, he's going to get up!</i>

411
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,902
I'll do it.

412
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:01,740
<i>Huh?! C-Could that be...?</i>

413
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,367
<i>Sharingan!</i>

414
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:09,080
<i>Sasuke, when has he...
Why is that in his eyes...</i>

415
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,374
<i>And in both eyes...!</i>

416
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,294
<i>Is that the Sharingan?</i>

417
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,423
<i>Sasuke's awesome, after all!</i>

418
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,802
<i>If this is the same Kekkei Genkai
as Kakashi Sensei's...</i>

419
00:29:23,427 --> 00:29:25,346
<i>he can read Bushy Brow's jutsu!</i>

420
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,310
<i>Huh?!</i>

421
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:33,730
<i>To not be able to discern the jutsu
with the Sharingan...</i>

422
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,483
<i>Could it be...that his technique is...!</i>

423
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:38,818
That's right...

424
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,821
My technique is neither
ninjutsu nor genjutsu.

425
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:52,957
That's right!

426
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,254
My technique is
mere taijutsu...Sasuke.

427
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:02,091
You may not be able to
believe it just like that, but...

428
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,092
Punk!

429
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:08,413
In other words, even if you understand
with your eyes,

430
00:30:08,438 --> 00:30:11,358
there's nothing you can do if your
body can't keep up.

431
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:16,147
There are two types of strong people,
genius types and effort types.

432
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:20,443
If your Sharingan is
a genius type drawing Uchiha ability...

433
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:25,156
I'm an effort type who has
patiently mastered only taijutsu.

434
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,325
In a manner of speaking,

435
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:31,855
your Sharingan and my ultimate
taijutsu have the worst compatibility...

436
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:42,423
It's my victory!

437
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,514
That's as far as it goes! Lee!

438
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:51,808
Sasuke!

439
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,859
<i>Sasuke was beaten?!</i>

440
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:04,320
<i>What happened while
I was knocked out?!</i>

441
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:07,282
Are you okay?! Sasuke.

442
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,746
<i>He's agitated...
To think he couldn't fall properly.</i>

443
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:16,958
Y-You were watching...?

444
00:31:18,134 --> 00:31:21,513
Lee! That technique just now
is prohibited, you know!

445
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:25,216
<i>W-What's with that turtle...?</i>

446
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,720
I-I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...

447
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,348
<i>He's...getting scolded or something...</i>

448
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:37,729
<i>Could that be...Bushy Brow's teacher?!</i>

449
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,863
<i>There's no mistake!</i>

450
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,032
Hey-hey.

451
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:50,450
What...?

452
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:54,537
That thing...It's a turtle, right?
Right?

453
00:31:54,562 --> 00:31:56,397
Isn't it obvious?!

454
00:31:56,673 --> 00:32:00,385
Say! Say! Can even a turtle
become a ninja teacher?

455
00:32:00,677 --> 00:32:02,253
I don't know!

456
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:07,926
<i>To think I lost to someone so flippant...</i>

457
00:32:11,312 --> 00:32:13,848
Have you prepared yourself?

458
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,350
Y-Yes sir...

459
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:19,812
All right, if you will, Guy Sensei!

460
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:27,028
Man! Life treating you good, huh?

461
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,071
Huh?!

462
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:34,494
Whoaaa! An even more
intense guy has appeared!

463
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:35,437
Yo, Lee!

464
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:39,165
T-Those are some incredibly
raging brows...

465
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,943
I've never seen anything like that
in my life.

466
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:47,799
H-Hey! You guys!
Don't mock Guy Sensei!

467
00:32:47,907 --> 00:32:49,842
Shut up!

468
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,719
I'm at a loss for a reaction because

469
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,471
of those bizarre things appearing
one after another!

470
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:54,639
What?!

471
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,516
Idiot!

472
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:11,572
Lee, you...you...

473
00:33:11,881 --> 00:33:13,549
S-Sensei...!

474
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:16,911
L-Lee...

475
00:33:17,945 --> 00:33:21,541
Sensei...I...I...

476
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,420
Enough, Lee!
Don't say anything!

477
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,089
Sensei!

478
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,340
Lee!

479
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,431
<i>I lost to a guy like that...</i>

480
00:33:36,755 --> 00:33:39,425
Yes...this is adolescence!

481
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:41,227
Sensei!

482
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,608
That sort of tone's kind of nice, too.

483
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,611
I-Idiot! That's dangerous!
Very dangerous!

484
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,781
It's okay, Lee!

485
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,577
Mistakes come with adolescence.
Don't worry about it!

486
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:00,621
You're so kind...Sensei!

487
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,906
Lee, you will be
punished for attempting to

488
00:34:04,931 --> 00:34:07,171
break the prohibition,
on top of fighting...

489
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:11,049
in principle, after
the Chunin Exam.

490
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,008
Okay!

491
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:15,053
Five hundred howls of adolescence!

492
00:34:15,077 --> 00:34:15,911
Yes, sir!

493
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,933
<i>If I'm not mistaken, those kids are...</i>

494
00:34:21,391 --> 00:34:22,725
<i>Kakashi's...</i>

495
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,147
Oh! No, he's looking this way!

496
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:29,942
You guys...how's Kakashi Sensei?

497
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,778
You know Kakashi...?

498
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,738
I know him all too well.

499
00:34:35,874 --> 00:34:41,162
People call us...
eternal rivals.

500
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:43,289
Sounds like a lie!

501
00:34:43,313 --> 00:34:46,184
What're you saying?!
Guy Sensei really is...

502
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,376
That's fine.

503
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:50,630
"Action speaks louder than words"
anyway.

504
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:55,760
By the way, my record is fifty wins
and forty-nine losses.

505
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:56,511
Huh?!

506
00:34:56,536 --> 00:34:57,829
<i>This guy...</i>

507
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,348
When did he.?

508
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:04,936
One thing, I'm stronger than Kakashi...

509
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:07,814
<i>N-No way...</i>

510
00:35:08,056 --> 00:35:12,902
<i>He's fast! He's faster than Kakashi!
Is he human...?!</i>

511
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:16,572
How about that?!
Guy Sensei is awesome, isn't he?!

512
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,032
<i>Darn it...</i>

513
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,493
This time around,
Lee caused the trouble.

514
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:23,162
Out of consideration for my face,
forgive him.

515
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:26,499
Out of consideration for
this pleasant face.

516
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,918
<i>He's better than that Kakashi...?</i>

517
00:35:29,653 --> 00:35:32,505
<i>Darn it! He's...</i>

518
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,882
<i>not just all talk...</i>

519
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:40,096
You guys and Lee should probably go
to the classroom pretty soon.

520
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,105
<i>He...!</i>

521
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:56,445
Then, do your best, Lee!
Farewell!

522
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:57,488
Yes, sir.

523
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:58,406
What?!

524
00:36:01,634 --> 00:36:02,510
Sasuke...

525
00:36:03,518 --> 00:36:05,729
I have one last thing to tell you.

526
00:36:07,857 --> 00:36:09,792
I lied before.

527
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:16,007
The strongest man of the
Leaf Village genin might be on my team.

528
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,635
I'm entering in order
to defeat that person.

529
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,055
And, you are one of my targets.

530
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:27,518
Please prepare yourself for the Exam!

531
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:38,613
Sasuke...

532
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:42,033
Ha! So...

533
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:45,578
I guess Uchiha clan's not all that, huh?

534
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,038
Shut up!

535
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,416
I'll knock him flat next time!

536
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,044
Ha! That from someone
who just got whipped.

537
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:58,549
You saw it, didn't you? His hand...

538
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:06,515
That Bushy Brow probably did a heck
of a lot of special training.

539
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,267
Day after day...

540
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,603
More than you have...

541
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,913
I see. Sakura, you've come, too.

542
00:37:31,598 --> 00:37:35,436
Now you can formally register
for the Chunin Exam.

543
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:36,921
What do you mean?

544
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,232
Actually, from the start,

545
00:37:40,257 --> 00:37:45,322
only three man squads could
apply and take the exams.

546
00:37:45,937 --> 00:37:48,648
But Sensei, you said that the decision
to take the exams

547
00:37:48,673 --> 00:37:50,133
was up to the individual.

548
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,228
Yes...I said that.

549
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,355
Were you lying?

550
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:56,857
Yes, I was...

551
00:37:58,658 --> 00:38:00,452
If I said that,

552
00:38:01,202 --> 00:38:05,373
Sasuke and Naruto would probably
forcefully convince you to take it.

553
00:38:07,727 --> 00:38:09,937
Even if you didn't have
the will to apply,

554
00:38:10,545 --> 00:38:12,297
if Sasuke asks you

555
00:38:12,322 --> 00:38:15,534
you would attempt to take
the exams half heartedly.

556
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:20,047
For Sasuke's sake and,
well, Naruto's.

557
00:38:20,415 --> 00:38:21,541
Then, if...

558
00:38:21,598 --> 00:38:25,018
it had only been Sasuke and
Naruto who had come here?

559
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,221
I would've stopped the Exam here.

560
00:38:28,045 --> 00:38:30,506
I wouldn't have felt like letting
them go beyond this point.

561
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:34,662
But...you guys came here
on your own will.

562
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,314
Sakura!

563
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:38,899
Naruto!

564
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,402
And, Sasuke!

565
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:46,039
I'm glad you came.

566
00:38:46,948 --> 00:38:49,326
You're a team I'm proud of.

567
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,746
Now then, go on!

568
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,498
Okay! Let's go!

569
00:39:13,633 --> 00:39:17,095
<i>I was born with strength that
surpasses Elder Sister's.</i>

570
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,682
<i>This is my destiny!</i>

571
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:24,904
<i>That's why…</i>

572
00:39:25,103 --> 00:39:26,897
<i>I must get stronger…!</i>

573
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:35,956
<i>More, more, more…more!</i>

574
00:39:39,676 --> 00:39:41,678
Look at all your injuries…

575
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,132
Couldn't you be overdoing it a bit?

576
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:46,942
No such thing.

577
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,137
I must protect the Hyuga Clan.

578
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:55,659
Oh, that's right!

579
00:39:55,759 --> 00:39:59,305
It seems Lady Hinata is doing
very well as a genin.

580
00:39:59,739 --> 00:40:03,242
I hear she will be taking
the Chunin Exams.

581
00:40:03,716 --> 00:40:04,968
The Chunin Exams?

582
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:07,838
Yes. It's a test one must pass

583
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:10,408
in order to be promoted from
genin to chunin rank.

584
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:14,620
But I understand it's quite rigorous,
and there are even fatalities.

585
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,045
<i>There are so many of them...</i>

586
00:40:23,638 --> 00:40:26,015
<i>Could it be that they're all applicants?</i>

587
00:40:32,588 --> 00:40:35,883
<i>They...all look...immensely strong...</i>

588
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,438
Sasuke, you're late!

589
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:46,694
I thought I'd be able to see you
for the first time in awhile,

590
00:40:46,885 --> 00:40:49,388
so I was waiting in excitement.

591
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:54,577
Get away from Sasuke!
Ino Pig!

592
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,912
Oh, my. It's Sakura.

593
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,915
Your Billboard Brow hasn't changed, eh...
Ugly!

594
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,542
What did you say?!

595
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:06,380
What's up with this?

596
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:07,089
Huh?

597
00:41:07,363 --> 00:41:11,117
Are you guys going to take
this bothersome Exam, too?

598
00:41:11,342 --> 00:41:13,303
Oh, it's the idiot trio.

599
00:41:13,328 --> 00:41:15,080
Quit calling us that!

600
00:41:15,289 --> 00:41:17,332
Man, this is a freaking bother...

601
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:22,396
Yahoo, I found you!

602
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:25,524
My my, everybody's here.

603
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,693
H-Hello...

604
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,361
What did you say?

605
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,031
You guys, too?!
Man.

606
00:41:32,632 --> 00:41:34,467
Ha! I see.

607
00:41:34,566 --> 00:41:38,194
This means all nine genin rookies
are taking the Exam, eh...!

608
00:41:38,637 --> 00:41:39,346
Now then...

609
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:41,666
How far can we go?

610
00:41:41,823 --> 00:41:43,366
Eh...Sasuke?

611
00:41:43,693 --> 00:41:44,310
Hmph!...

612
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,253
You're mighty confident. Kiba.

613
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,214
We've trained a great deal, so...

614
00:41:49,338 --> 00:41:51,132
We won't lose to you guys!

615
00:41:51,157 --> 00:41:52,825
Shut up!

616
00:41:53,284 --> 00:41:54,327
Hey, you guys!

617
00:41:54,694 --> 00:41:57,030
You should be a little quieter.

618
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:03,687
You guys are the "rookie nine"...
fresh out of the academy, right?

619
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:08,400
Carrying on like that
with cute faces...Man.

620
00:42:08,934 --> 00:42:10,602
This isn't a field trip.

621
00:42:11,144 --> 00:42:13,396
Who're you? Acting all haughty!

622
00:42:13,638 --> 00:42:17,601
I'm Kabuto Yakushi.
Anyway, take a good look around you.

623
00:42:24,649 --> 00:42:28,152
Behind you...
They're from the Rain Village.

624
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:29,505
They're hot tempered.

625
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,174
Everyone's tense before the Exam.

626
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,594
I thought I'd warn you guys
before you get your butts whipped...

627
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:39,557
I guess it can't be helped.

628
00:42:39,781 --> 00:42:42,618
You're rookies who don't know
left from right...

629
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:45,762
You remind me of my old self.

630
00:42:46,238 --> 00:42:48,407
Then, is this your second time?

631
00:42:48,815 --> 00:42:49,566
No...

632
00:42:50,517 --> 00:42:51,559
It's my seventh time.

633
00:42:52,102 --> 00:42:52,894
Huh?!

634
00:42:53,378 --> 00:42:57,674
This Exam is only held twice a year,
so it's now my fourth year.

635
00:42:58,108 --> 00:43:02,112
Then that means you know
a lot about these exams?!

636
00:43:02,488 --> 00:43:03,363
Kind of...

637
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:09,737
Leaf, Sand, Rain, Grass,
Waterfall, Sound...

638
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:13,257
There are lots of exceptional genin
from those villages

639
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,926
who have come to take
the Exam this year as well.

640
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,222
As far as the Village Hidden
in Sound goes,

641
00:43:20,489 --> 00:43:23,283
it's a village of a small nation that
just sprang up in recent years,

642
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,351
so there isn't much information...

643
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:28,539
At any rate,

644
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,858
they're all Hidden Villages
with nothing but crackerjacks.

645
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,902
That kind of makes you lose
your confidence.

646
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:37,573
Why are you saying that now?

647
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:38,699
In other words...

648
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:41,342
all of the applicants who
have gathered here...

649
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:45,438
They're all choice top elite
genin from each nation.

650
00:43:45,963 --> 00:43:46,923
Hmm.

651
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,877
This isn't going to be easy.

652
00:43:52,813 --> 00:43:54,523
<i>I can't go along with this!</i>

653
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:56,884
<i>They may be your subordinates now,</i>

654
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:59,345
<i>but they are children
who were my students.</i>

655
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:00,763
<i>If it's about them I know...</i>

656
00:44:00,788 --> 00:44:03,207
<i>It's as you say, Iruka.</i>

657
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,977
<i>It's not going to be that easy.</i>

658
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:08,937
<i>You're too eager.</i>

659
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:12,441
<i>I postponed my team's test taking
for one year</i>

660
00:44:12,491 --> 00:44:14,034
<i>and took care to build up
their skills.</i>

661
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,713
<i>Have them take the Exam after they've
enjoyed their life a little bit more.</i>

662
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,073
<i>Hmph...</i>

663
00:44:19,298 --> 00:44:21,592
<i>They might be too easygoing.</i>

664
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:25,579
<i>But they will surpass
your guys in no time.</i>

665
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:28,832
<i>That's enough.</i>

666
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:31,710
<i>That's as far as
the rookie matter goes.</i>

667
00:44:32,176 --> 00:44:33,511
<i>Now then, next...</i>

668
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:36,548
<i>I'll take recommendations for genin
other than rookies.</i>

669
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,093
<i>I said that, nevertheless...</i>

670
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:44,932
<i>I wonder if even the fearless ones
are frightened just this time around.</i>

671
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,018
My name's Naruto Uzumaki!

672
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:52,064
I won't lose to any of you!
Got it?!

673
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,904
Say! What's with him?!

674
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:02,116
<i>That idiot would never
get depressed! Absurd!</i>

675
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,785
It won't do any good to
provoke everyone!

676
00:45:04,851 --> 00:45:06,011
Don't tell me!

677
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:07,871
If I don't tell it to you,
who do I tell it to?!

678
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:09,081
What did you say?!

679
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:11,709
Oh, I feel better.

680
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:13,377
Hmph...

681
00:45:19,073 --> 00:45:21,576
Isn't that the guy from before...?

682
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:24,096
The dog's bark is
bigger than its bite.

683
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:25,764
Is he an idiot...?

684
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:28,016
He's mighty high-spirited.

685
00:45:28,316 --> 00:45:29,609
He's hot-headed, eh.

686
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:33,230
Lee, maybe you did
not bully him enough.

687
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:36,734
Did you hear?

688
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:40,404
Sound Village is a minor
Hidden Village of a small nation.

689
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:42,239
That's offensive.

690
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:45,534
Maybe I'll...play with them a bit.

691
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:50,956
Yes, being referred to as something
like leftover shinobi and all.

692
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:10,350
<i>These guys...are the Sound Village...</i>

693
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:13,437
<i>I can see through that speed.</i>

694
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:18,442
I see...It's that kind of attack, eh?

695
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:22,780
Huh?!

696
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,080
Oh! He puked?!

697
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:33,791
K-Kabuto?

698
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:35,000
Huh?!

699
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:37,294
Hah!

700
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,007
Hey, Kabuto!

701
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,008
Are you okay?!

702
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:45,010
Yeah...I'm okay.

703
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:46,303
Really?

704
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:49,765
<i>Oh, so he's not so special.</i>

705
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,768
<i>Even though he's a veteran who's been
taking the exams for four whole years.</i>

706
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,605
The three from Sound village...
Doubtless chunin.

707
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:02,861
<i>Kabuto should've totally read the attack..</i>

708
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:05,656
<i>But why did he vomit?</i>

709
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:08,617
Lee. How about that technique just now?

710
00:47:09,301 --> 00:47:11,052
I had no problem reading the speed.

711
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:12,996
There's some kind of trick...

712
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:19,169
Silence! Degenerates!

713
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:34,893
Sorry to keep you waiting.

714
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:41,650
I'm Ibiki Morino, proctor for
the first test of the Chunin Exam.

715
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,198
You, from Hidden Sound Village!

716
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,869
No doing as you please
before the Exam!

717
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:54,538
You want to be failed
at the get go?!

718
00:47:56,748 --> 00:48:02,045
Sorry. It's our first time taking the
Exams, so we flipped out...

719
00:48:03,497 --> 00:48:06,792
Hmph. This is a good opportunity,
so I'll say this.

720
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,428
There will be no battles,
competitions and the like

721
00:48:09,552 --> 00:48:11,054
without the permission
of the proctors!

722
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,915
And even if you get permission,

723
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:17,110
actions that could lead to the death
of an opponent will not be permitted.

724
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:21,773
Any pig that screws with me
will be disqualified immediately.

725
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,025
Got it?!

726
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:27,362
This Exam looks to be easy!

727
00:48:30,214 --> 00:48:34,343
Now then, we will start
the first test of the Chunin Exam!

728
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:36,413
Turn in your applications,

729
00:48:36,771 --> 00:48:39,273
take one of these number cards
in exchange,

730
00:48:39,298 --> 00:48:41,467
and sit in the seat
matching that number!

731
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:44,963
After that, we will hand out
the paper for the written test!

732
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:47,799
Written? Paper?

733
00:48:48,883 --> 00:48:50,051
Paper...

734
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:56,683
A paper test?!

735
00:49:03,931 --> 00:49:09,270
<i>Everyone's seats are all scattered...
What should I do?</i>

736
00:49:10,705 --> 00:49:11,706
Naruto...

737
00:49:12,857 --> 00:49:16,569
Oh! You are Hinata!
Since when have you?

738
00:49:19,097 --> 00:49:22,016
L-Let's both do our best.

739
00:49:22,483 --> 00:49:23,776
Y-Yeah.

740
00:49:25,145 --> 00:49:30,025
There are several important
rules to this first test.

741
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:35,764
I will take no questions,
so listen well accordingly!

742
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:39,359
<i>Rules? No questions will be taken...?</i>

743
00:49:40,084 --> 00:49:42,086
First off is the first rule!

744
00:49:42,845 --> 00:49:47,141
You are given ten points
each from the start!

745
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:49,544
The written test has
ten problems in all!

746
00:49:49,628 --> 00:49:51,213
Each problem is one point.

747
00:49:51,463 --> 00:49:54,674
And, this test is a
point deduction system.

748
00:49:55,383 --> 00:49:58,220
You are deducted one point for
each problem you get wrong!

749
00:49:58,845 --> 00:50:02,224
If you get three wrong,
you'll have seven points!

750
00:50:02,808 --> 00:50:03,975
The second rule.

751
00:50:04,684 --> 00:50:06,186
Pass or failure will be determined

752
00:50:06,228 --> 00:50:08,230
by the total points of
the three person teams.

753
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:11,775
W-Wait a minute!

754
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:14,820
What do you mean...
total points of the teams?

755
00:50:15,028 --> 00:50:15,862
Shut up!

756
00:50:16,196 --> 00:50:17,864
There's a perfectly
good reason for this!

757
00:50:18,198 --> 00:50:19,491
Shut up and listen!

758
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:22,077
If you've got it,
here is the most important next rule!

759
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:24,663
Those who are deemed by
the sentinels

760
00:50:24,704 --> 00:50:29,167
as having committed an act of
cheating or something similar to that...

761
00:50:29,709 --> 00:50:34,673
will have two points deducted
for each act.

762
00:50:35,257 --> 00:50:36,216
In other words...

763
00:50:36,258 --> 00:50:39,761
there may be those who will be
dismissed during this test

764
00:50:39,886 --> 00:50:42,973
without waiting for test grading.

765
00:50:46,102 --> 00:50:47,769
<i>This means they're deducting points</i>

766
00:50:47,894 --> 00:50:50,147
<i>from things other
than the written test problems.</i>

767
00:50:50,438 --> 00:50:53,150
Know that those who
commit awkward cheating...

768
00:50:53,692 --> 00:50:55,777
will bring ruin upon yourselves.

769
00:50:56,494 --> 00:50:58,830
I'll check you anytime.

770
00:51:00,115 --> 00:51:02,701
If you aspire to become
a chunin at all,

771
00:51:02,834 --> 00:51:06,546
know that shinobi should act
like exemplary shinobi.

772
00:51:07,914 --> 00:51:10,792
<i>Relax!
Yes...yes!</i>

773
00:51:11,326 --> 00:51:14,495
<i>Naruto aside,
Sasuke and I are okay!</i>

774
00:51:14,963 --> 00:51:18,592
<i>Even if Naruto gets zero points...
if we cover that...</i>

775
00:51:19,217 --> 00:51:23,597
And, in the case of even one person
on the team getting zero points...

776
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:26,850
Everyone on that team will fail!

777
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:27,767
<i>Wha?!</i>

778
00:51:27,809 --> 00:51:29,311
What did he say?!

779
00:51:30,729 --> 00:51:32,230
<i>I feel two menacing stares...</i>

780
00:51:33,315 --> 00:51:34,482
Naruto?

781
00:51:34,941 --> 00:51:38,778
By the way, the last problem will
be given forty five minutes

782
00:51:38,803 --> 00:51:40,138
after the start of the test!

783
00:51:41,305 --> 00:51:42,848
The time for the test is one hour.

784
00:51:46,453 --> 00:51:47,204
Begin!

785
00:51:56,421 --> 00:51:57,380
<i>Could it...</i>

786
00:51:57,464 --> 00:51:59,716
<i>Could it be that,
the fat is really on the fire now...?</i>

787
00:52:00,342 --> 00:52:03,011
<i>Naruto!
Just don't get zero points!</i>

788
00:52:06,546 --> 00:52:10,634
<i>Naruto isn't getting jitters
from the get go, is he...?</i>

789
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:12,145
<i>This is bad...</i>

790
00:52:16,524 --> 00:52:17,901
<i>As if!</i>

791
00:52:17,984 --> 00:52:21,988
<i>I know I've cleared many obstacles
like this before...</i>

792
00:52:22,155 --> 00:52:24,324
<i>At times like this, one should
look at all the problems</i>

793
00:52:24,366 --> 00:52:25,909
<i>without feeling pressed
or making a fuss!</i>

794
00:52:25,992 --> 00:52:28,052
<i>And then with utmost effort</i>

795
00:52:28,077 --> 00:52:30,746
<i>I should tackle the problems that look
easy to understand!</i>

796
00:52:30,997 --> 00:52:34,668
<i>Let's see, the first problem...
is a code text, eh...</i>

797
00:52:34,884 --> 00:52:36,803
<i>Excellent, I say!</i>

798
00:52:39,381 --> 00:52:40,298
<i>Next! Next!</i>

799
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:42,342
<i>Let's see...the second problem...</i>

800
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:47,097
<i>The parabola B in the diagram illustrates
the greatest possible distance</i>

801
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:51,851
<i>Enemy ninja A can throw his shuriken
from a tree seven meters high...</i>

802
00:52:52,686 --> 00:52:55,146
<i>Predict and answer the enemy ninja's
character inferred</i>

803
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:57,691
<i>from the ellipse this shuriken forms,</i>

804
00:52:57,833 --> 00:53:01,670
<i>also answer the longest firing range
in battle on flat ground</i>

805
00:53:01,695 --> 00:53:03,697
<i>and explain your basis.</i>

806
00:53:05,323 --> 00:53:09,077
<i>T-This is an...integrated problem based
on predictions</i>

807
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:13,248
<i>of uncertain conditions and
dynamic energy analysis application!</i>

808
00:53:14,249 --> 00:53:16,668
<i>There's no way
Naruto can solve this!</i>

809
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:17,894
<i>I mean...</i>

810
00:53:17,919 --> 00:53:22,173
<i>hardly anyone except me
can solve this problem!</i>

811
00:53:24,884 --> 00:53:26,177
<i>Okay, next!
Next!</i>

812
00:53:31,349 --> 00:53:33,768
<i>These other problems...
are nothing but difficult ones.</i>

813
00:53:36,271 --> 00:53:37,355
<i>I see...</i>

814
00:53:38,606 --> 00:53:41,568
<i>I don't...understand even
one of these problems.</i>

815
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:47,407
<i>Oh, no, this is bad!</i>

816
00:53:47,574 --> 00:53:49,075
<i>For real! For real!</i>

817
00:53:49,117 --> 00:53:52,329
<i>What should I do?
What should I do? What should I do?</i>

818
00:54:01,588 --> 00:54:05,842
<i>If about ten of all fifty one teams
are able to pass,</i>

819
00:54:06,468 --> 00:54:09,621
<i>it will be bad if I didn't stretch myself
and get a considerable amount of points.</i>

820
00:54:10,388 --> 00:54:12,849
<i>It's like a system inviting cheating...</i>

821
00:54:13,767 --> 00:54:17,145
<i>I hope Sasuke and Naruto
won't panic and cheat.</i>

822
00:54:20,565 --> 00:54:21,399
<i>Don't panic...</i>

823
00:54:21,483 --> 00:54:24,569
<i>For now, all there is to do is to be
very, very cautious...</i>

824
00:54:24,611 --> 00:54:27,739
<i>and cheat without being found out!</i>

825
00:54:29,574 --> 00:54:31,701
<i>At any rate, this elaborate fuss...</i>

826
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,663
<i>It's like a trick assuming
that we're going to cheat.</i>

827
00:54:36,915 --> 00:54:39,209
<i>They probably check with that paper...</i>

828
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:43,755
<i>Somebody got nailed.</i>

829
00:54:44,756 --> 00:54:47,509
<i>Cheating deducts two points.</i>

830
00:54:49,068 --> 00:54:50,444
<i>Two point deduction, huh...</i>

831
00:54:52,263 --> 00:54:55,642
<i>Ordinarily, it'd be failure the moment
the cheating was discovered...</i>

832
00:54:58,912 --> 00:55:01,373
<i>A test to see the ability
for intensive information collection</i>

833
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:04,109
<i>with the full use of deception
and concealment techniques.</i>

834
00:55:06,653 --> 00:55:08,822
<i>"Shinobi should read
the double bluff," eh...</i>

835
00:55:09,656 --> 00:55:11,574
<i>In other words, the true intention
of the proctor is...</i>

836
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:14,994
<i>if you're going to cheat,
not "awkward cheating,"</i>

837
00:55:15,578 --> 00:55:19,541
<i>but "like exemplary shinobi",
don't get caught.</i>

838
00:55:20,542 --> 00:55:23,711
<i>Viewed in this light, the extraordinariness
of the point deduction system,</i>

839
00:55:23,837 --> 00:55:29,426
<i>the lenience of only deducting two points
for each discovery of cheating makes sense.</i>

840
00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:31,861
<i>In other words,</i>

841
00:55:31,886 --> 00:55:35,056
<i>what's being tested here is how
we can gather the correct answers</i>

842
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:38,835
<i>without having our cheating detected
by the proctors or</i>

843
00:55:38,893 --> 00:55:41,813
<i>by the one being cheated on.</i>

844
00:55:42,689 --> 00:55:44,357
<i>Realize it quick, Naruto!</i>

845
00:55:45,483 --> 00:55:46,651
<i>It'll turn into a fatal mistake!</i>

846
00:55:47,402 --> 00:55:48,319
<i>Realize it!</i>

847
00:55:55,243 --> 00:55:56,911
<i>This is bad. Believe it...</i>

848
00:56:03,042 --> 00:56:04,586
<i>So Gaara has also started, eh...</i>

849
00:56:05,544 --> 00:56:08,130
<i>Hmph...l'm counting on you, Crow.</i>

850
00:56:21,728 --> 00:56:27,859
Yahoo, good boy, Akamaru!
Next is problem four!

851
00:56:39,204 --> 00:56:40,497
<i>Judging from this rhythm...</i>

852
00:56:40,538 --> 00:56:43,374
<i>The stroke order...
and the number of strokes...</i>

853
00:56:45,376 --> 00:56:46,753
<i>I see.</i>

854
00:57:03,228 --> 00:57:04,729
Okay! Please tell me.

855
00:57:09,952 --> 00:57:11,027
Eight, huh.

856
00:57:22,413 --> 00:57:24,290
<i>Lee, if you can see it,
wear your headband!</i>

857
00:57:45,111 --> 00:57:47,489
<i>Time is rapidly going by!</i>

858
00:57:47,605 --> 00:57:50,942
<i>Oh, man! I'm afraid all there
is to do is cheat...</i>

859
00:57:51,734 --> 00:57:53,528
<i>But, if I'm discovered,</i>

860
00:57:53,695 --> 00:57:56,614
<i>it'll be trouble for Sakura
and Sasuke.</i>

861
00:57:57,699 --> 00:57:59,867
<i>On the other hand,
if I get zero points...</i>

862
00:57:59,951 --> 00:58:02,954
<i>Sakura and Sasuke will be
my companions in failure.</i>

863
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:04,872
Naruto...

864
00:58:07,242 --> 00:58:11,629
I'll show you...my test.

865
00:58:11,963 --> 00:58:12,714
<i>Huh...?</i>

866
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:15,758
<i>What is Hinata saying...?</i>

867
00:58:16,342 --> 00:58:18,344
Why would you show me?

868
00:58:22,724 --> 00:58:24,559
Uh...uh...actually...

869
00:58:28,504 --> 00:58:32,967
I don't want you, Naruto...
to leave at this stage...

870
00:58:38,197 --> 00:58:41,409
Y-You see...
the nine of us are the only rookies...

871
00:58:41,909 --> 00:58:45,163
and I have many anxieties about
what's to come, so!

872
00:58:47,498 --> 00:58:52,337
I get it now! I was kind of
strangely suspicious of you!

873
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:58,885
<i>Anyhow! This is crazy lucky, I say!</i>

874
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:00,953
<i>Thank goodness I'm next to Hinata...</i>

875
00:59:06,934 --> 00:59:10,479
You made five mistakes. You fail!

876
00:59:11,105 --> 00:59:12,607
N-No way...

877
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:17,236
His two buddies, both of you get out
of the classroom, right now.

878
00:59:26,579 --> 00:59:28,331
#23 fails!

879
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:30,792
#43 and #27 fail!

880
00:59:30,958 --> 00:59:32,293
Noooo!

881
00:59:34,712 --> 00:59:40,051
Hey, hey! Do you have proof that
I cheated five whole times?!

882
00:59:40,125 --> 00:59:44,380
Really, are you guys properly checking
this number of people?

883
00:59:47,767 --> 00:59:48,768
Listen up...

884
00:59:48,893 --> 00:59:54,315
Even among us chunin, we're elite
who were selected for this Exam.

885
00:59:55,233 --> 00:59:58,403
We don't overlook you blinking once...

886
00:59:58,786 --> 01:00:01,872
In a matter of speaking,
this strength is the proof.

887
01:00:06,911 --> 01:00:07,912
Naruto?

888
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:11,649
Hurry...Look...

889
01:00:29,116 --> 01:00:32,870
Hinata...You don't get it, do you?

890
01:00:33,488 --> 01:00:34,155
What?

891
01:00:35,148 --> 01:00:39,360
An awesome ninja like me
won't cheat. Believe it!

892
01:00:40,236 --> 01:00:41,904
N-Naruto.

893
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:44,115
B-But...

894
01:00:48,336 --> 01:00:50,087
Also, if something went wrong,

895
01:00:50,212 --> 01:00:54,049
you'd be in a hot spot for
helping me cheat, right?!

896
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:55,168
<i>What?!</i>

897
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:56,502
<i>Naruto...</i>

898
01:00:58,546 --> 01:01:02,216
I'm...sorry...
I-I did something uncalled for...

899
01:01:03,092 --> 01:01:05,470
<i>I...went and acted big.</i>

900
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:09,790
<i>What should I do?
I'm extremely stupid.</i>

901
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:16,522
<i>Byakugan!</i>

902
01:01:19,241 --> 01:01:20,492
<i>Sharingan!</i>

903
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:22,987
<i>I'll copy all his movements!</i>

904
01:01:25,698 --> 01:01:27,742
<i>My hand is moving fluently...</i>

905
01:01:28,326 --> 01:01:30,036
<i>I hit the jackpot straight away
with this guy.</i>

906
01:01:30,578 --> 01:01:32,246
#59! Fails!

907
01:01:33,206 --> 01:01:34,707
#33! #9!

908
01:01:36,042 --> 01:01:38,002
<i>This is the thirteenth group to fail.</i>

909
01:01:39,837 --> 01:01:41,380
#41 fails.

910
01:01:41,881 --> 01:01:44,550
#35, #62 fails!

911
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:45,626
No way!

912
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:50,431
<i>That brat...</i>

913
01:01:51,323 --> 01:01:56,077
<i>He coolly proceeds through this
ruckus without moving an eyelash.</i>

914
01:01:57,496 --> 01:01:59,331
<i>Very well done considering he's new.</i>

915
01:02:07,372 --> 01:02:09,666
<i>The optic nerves are connected...</i>

916
01:02:10,218 --> 01:02:12,470
<i>The third eye...open!</i>

917
01:02:28,845 --> 01:02:30,346
<i>Ugh! There's dirt in my eye...</i>

918
01:02:31,222 --> 01:02:32,223
<i>Dang it!</i>

919
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:50,157
Excuse me.

920
01:02:50,658 --> 01:02:51,409
What is it?

921
01:02:51,883 --> 01:02:53,468
I need to go to the bathroom...

922
01:02:55,488 --> 01:02:58,074
We will accompany you
to the bathroom.

923
01:02:59,125 --> 01:03:00,376
I see...

924
01:03:02,844 --> 01:03:07,683
Anyhow...the proctors are
nothing so special!

925
01:03:08,591 --> 01:03:11,720
They don't realize that the proctors
have increased by one...

926
01:03:12,471 --> 01:03:14,473
Eh, don't you think so...

927
01:03:15,057 --> 01:03:16,267
Crow?

928
01:03:21,287 --> 01:03:24,040
<i>Forty minutes have passed
since the test started...</i>

929
01:03:24,609 --> 01:03:26,277
<i>Twenty minutes left...huh...</i>

930
01:03:27,645 --> 01:03:29,021
<i>Since it's come to this,</i>

931
01:03:29,046 --> 01:03:32,966
<i>it's the last problem to be given forty
five minutes after the start of the test.</i>

932
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:38,164
<i>All there is to do is bet on this.
Believe it!</i>

933
01:03:41,358 --> 01:03:42,109
All right!

934
01:03:43,419 --> 01:03:46,130
Here is the tenth question!

935
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:48,908
<i>Here it comes!</i>

936
01:03:49,425 --> 01:03:52,261
<i>I have to put everything on
the line for this question!</i>

937
01:03:55,389 --> 01:03:58,434
But before that,

938
01:03:59,327 --> 01:04:04,249
I'm going to add
some rules for the last question.

939
01:04:09,236 --> 01:04:11,697
Aren't you lucky?

940
01:04:14,158 --> 01:04:17,202
It looks like playing with
the dolls wasn't a waste, after all?

941
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:19,272
<i>This guy.</i>

942
01:04:19,297 --> 01:04:21,049
<i>He's figured Crow out!</i>

943
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:24,360
Anyway, sit down.

944
01:04:36,123 --> 01:04:37,791
Let me explain!

945
01:04:38,834 --> 01:04:40,210
These are

946
01:04:41,837 --> 01:04:43,797
the hopeless rules!

947
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:49,803
Well, anyhow.

948
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:53,307
There's nothing to do when
the subordinates are gone, huh?

949
01:04:53,682 --> 01:04:57,352
Well, it'll get busy soon enough.

950
01:04:57,978 --> 01:04:58,896
Why?

951
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:03,191
This year's first proctor...

952
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:05,694
I hear it's that Ibiki Morino.

953
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:09,698
<i>Well then, passing the first exam
already seems iffy.</i>

954
01:05:11,617 --> 01:05:14,453
Of all the people, that sadist...

955
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:15,921
Sadist?

956
01:05:16,305 --> 01:05:22,436
Kurenai, you're a new jonin,
so you wouldn't know.

957
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:25,881
Who is this person?

958
01:05:27,299 --> 01:05:29,635
He is a pro, a professional.

959
01:05:30,177 --> 01:05:32,679
Professional? Of what?

960
01:05:39,193 --> 01:05:41,904
Torture and interrogation.

961
01:05:42,147 --> 01:05:42,981
What?!

962
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:48,320
Well, there maybe no physical torture
in the exam itself,

963
01:05:48,561 --> 01:05:51,122
but he's sure to use his
his skills as an interrogator

964
01:05:51,147 --> 01:05:54,492
to torment them psychologically.

965
01:05:56,244 --> 01:05:57,329
That is...

966
01:05:58,705 --> 01:06:03,085
Leaf Village ANBU's
Torture and Interrogation Unit Marshall,

967
01:06:03,585 --> 01:06:05,128
Ibiki Morino!

968
01:06:09,508 --> 01:06:12,052
<i>Hopeless rules...?!</i>

969
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,014
First, you guys will have to choose

970
01:06:16,348 --> 01:06:21,228
whether or not you will take
this 10th question!

971
01:06:21,853 --> 01:06:22,521
<i>Huh?!</i>

972
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:27,067
<i>Choose whether or not
to take the exam?</i>

973
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:29,361
What, choose?!

974
01:06:29,611 --> 01:06:32,197
What happens if you choose not
to take the 10th exam?

975
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:38,412
If you chose not to take the exam,
then your score will be zero.

976
01:06:39,246 --> 01:06:42,416
And of course, the same goes for
the two others in the same group!

977
01:06:42,958 --> 01:06:44,001
W-What does that mean!

978
01:06:44,126 --> 01:06:46,628
Of course, everybody is going to
choose to take the exam!

979
01:06:47,004 --> 01:06:49,256
This is ridiculous!
As if we have a choice!

980
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:53,635
And...one more rule...

981
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:57,347
If you chose to take it and
are unable to answer it correctly,

982
01:06:58,181 --> 01:07:00,017
then you will have to...

983
01:07:01,685 --> 01:07:05,689
relinquish your right
of taking the Chunin Exam forever.

984
01:07:09,026 --> 01:07:11,028
What kind of ridiculous rule is that?!

985
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:13,905
Besides, there are plenty
of people here

986
01:07:13,989 --> 01:07:15,866
who have taken the
Chunin Exam many times!

987
01:07:17,826 --> 01:07:20,120
I make the rule this year.

988
01:07:22,414 --> 01:07:25,751
But I did give you
the option to go back!

989
01:07:28,170 --> 01:07:31,548
For those of you who aren't confident,
you can choose not to take it

990
01:07:31,764 --> 01:07:34,475
and take the exam
next year or the year after that.

991
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:39,639
<i>Oh! How terrible!</i>

992
01:07:40,348 --> 01:07:43,602
<i>If one out of the three
chooses not to take the exam,</i>

993
01:07:43,852 --> 01:07:45,937
<i>then all three will be failed.</i>

994
01:07:47,272 --> 01:07:50,484
<i>If you do choose to take it,
but get the wrong answer...</i>

995
01:07:50,859 --> 01:07:53,153
<i>then that person will be a
genin for the rest of their life!</i>

996
01:07:54,029 --> 01:07:55,864
<i>No matter what,
the odds are against us!</i>

997
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:58,700
<i>It's an impossible choice
for anyone with normal nerves!</i>

998
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:03,997
Then, let's begin...

999
01:08:05,499 --> 01:08:07,125
The 10th question...

1000
01:08:07,725 --> 01:08:10,353
Those who will not be taking it,
raise your hands!

1001
01:08:11,296 --> 01:08:14,466
Once I confirm your number,
I'll ask you to leave!

1002
01:08:18,845 --> 01:08:22,307
I...I...

1003
01:08:24,351 --> 01:08:26,561
I'm quitting!
I'm not going to take it!

1004
01:08:28,105 --> 01:08:29,523
#50 failed!

1005
01:08:30,649 --> 01:08:34,653
#130, #111 will be
failed as well...

1006
01:08:36,196 --> 01:08:39,199
I-I'm sorry...
Gennai! Inaho!

1007
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:43,411
Darn...

1008
01:08:44,121 --> 01:08:45,163
M-Me too!

1009
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:48,959
Me too!

1010
01:09:00,387 --> 01:09:01,304
<i>Naruto...</i>

1011
01:09:02,931 --> 01:09:04,808
<i>Why don't you raise your hand?</i>

1012
01:09:10,438 --> 01:09:11,148
<i>That guy...</i>

1013
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:13,775
<i>I am the super elite ninja</i>

1014
01:09:13,817 --> 01:09:15,610
<i>who will be carrying
the name of the Hokage!</i>

1015
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:19,681
<i>My name is Naruto Uzumaki,
remember that!</i>

1016
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:22,159
<i>Shut up!</i>

1017
01:09:22,409 --> 01:09:26,454
<i>I'm prepared to do anything
to become a Hokage!</i>

1018
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:28,290
<i>I will surpass the Hokage!</i>

1019
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:31,334
<i>And I will make all of
the people in the village</i>

1020
01:09:31,418 --> 01:09:33,837
<i>acknowledge my presence!</i>

1021
01:09:38,425 --> 01:09:41,011
<i>He's always got such a one track mind.</i>

1022
01:09:41,052 --> 01:09:43,597
<i>Saying Hokage, Hokage
all the time like a fool.</i>

1023
01:09:46,892 --> 01:09:48,518
<i>I'm sorry, Naruto.</i>

1024
01:09:49,477 --> 01:09:50,854
<i>It seems like...</i>

1025
01:09:50,896 --> 01:09:53,023
<i>I don't want to...</i>

1026
01:09:56,443 --> 01:09:58,028
<i>crush your unachievable dreams.</i>

1027
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:11,917
Don't underestimate me!
I won't run!

1028
01:10:13,585 --> 01:10:14,669
I'll take it!

1029
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:17,339
But even if I'm stuck being
a genin forever,

1030
01:10:17,923 --> 01:10:21,259
I will become a Hokage
no matter what it takes!

1031
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:26,431
I'm not scared!

1032
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:35,065
<i>That guy, he wasn't even
thinking of us at all.</i>

1033
01:10:35,899 --> 01:10:37,442
<i>Such audacity!</i>

1034
01:10:38,026 --> 01:10:39,110
<i>That's right...</i>

1035
01:10:39,486 --> 01:10:41,529
<i>That's exactly the kind of fool you are!</i>

1036
01:10:43,823 --> 01:10:45,450
I'll ask again.

1037
01:10:46,917 --> 01:10:49,002
It's a choice that will alter your life.

1038
01:10:49,955 --> 01:10:51,706
If you want to quit, now is your chance!

1039
01:10:52,332 --> 01:10:55,126
I'm not going to take back
my words!

1040
01:10:55,669 --> 01:10:57,212
That is my way of ninja!

1041
01:11:06,221 --> 01:11:09,015
<i>Huh...What a funny kid.</i>

1042
01:11:09,766 --> 01:11:13,270
<i>He completely brushed away
those kids' anxieties.</i>

1043
01:11:15,313 --> 01:11:19,776
<i>78, huh? Much more left
than I expected.</i>

1044
01:11:20,944 --> 01:11:23,697
<i>It's going to be the same.
No matter how much more I push it.</i>

1045
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,456
I like your determination!

1046
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:35,250
Then...

1047
01:11:36,334 --> 01:11:38,253
For those who are still here...

1048
01:11:39,379 --> 01:11:40,964
The first exam...

1049
01:11:44,134 --> 01:11:46,052
You have passed it!

1050
01:11:47,721 --> 01:11:48,513
Huh?

1051
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:52,225
H-Hey, what does that mean?

1052
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:54,311
All of a sudden you're telling us
that we've passed!

1053
01:11:54,394 --> 01:11:55,729
What about the 10th question?

1054
01:11:58,473 --> 01:12:00,975
There wasn't such
a thing to begin with!

1055
01:12:01,568 --> 01:12:04,821
Well, you can look at the choice you
just had to make as the 10th question!

1056
01:12:05,322 --> 01:12:05,989
What?!

1057
01:12:06,281 --> 01:12:07,157
Hey!

1058
01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:10,910
Then, what were all
those nine questions for!

1059
01:12:10,952 --> 01:12:12,329
It was just a waste of time!

1060
01:12:12,412 --> 01:12:13,830
Not a waste...

1061
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:18,918
The objective of the nine questions
were already accomplished.

1062
01:12:20,462 --> 01:12:25,759
To test your individual ability
to gather information!

1063
01:12:26,968 --> 01:12:28,928
Ability to gather information?

1064
01:12:29,721 --> 01:12:30,430
First...

1065
01:12:31,139 --> 01:12:33,058
The focus of this test was

1066
01:12:33,232 --> 01:12:35,452
on the system of determining
the pass or failure

1067
01:12:35,477 --> 01:12:39,856
based on the three person groups
that was proposed in the first rule.

1068
01:12:40,732 --> 01:12:42,108
By grading the exam on
a group basis,

1069
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:47,989
I added the unimaginable pressure
of dragging down your teammates.

1070
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:50,700
I see, I see.

1071
01:12:50,784 --> 01:12:54,079
I kind of felt that was
the point of this test!

1072
01:12:54,788 --> 01:12:56,122
<i>No, you didn't!</i>

1073
01:12:58,875 --> 01:12:59,667
However...

1074
01:13:00,168 --> 01:13:02,170
The questions on these tests weren't
things that

1075
01:13:02,253 --> 01:13:05,048
you genin ninja would
have been able to solve...

1076
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:08,301
So in that case...

1077
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:12,430
I imagined that most of you here
would have come to this conclusion:

1078
01:13:12,789 --> 01:13:16,000
"In order to score points,
I'll have to cheat."

1079
01:13:16,810 --> 01:13:17,644
In other words,

1080
01:13:17,685 --> 01:13:20,897
this exam was created under the premise
that you all would cheat!

1081
01:13:29,322 --> 01:13:32,325
That being said,

1082
01:13:32,525 --> 01:13:35,553
I had two chunin in the group
who knew all of the answers

1083
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:38,623
from whom you could cheat.

1084
01:13:38,957 --> 01:13:42,377
<i>What?! That's what it was?</i>

1085
01:13:42,836 --> 01:13:45,004
I had a hard time figuring
out the guy.

1086
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:46,714
Yeah. Really...

1087
01:13:49,134 --> 01:13:50,844
It was so obvious!

1088
01:13:50,969 --> 01:13:52,971
There's something wrong with you
if you didn't notice!

1089
01:13:53,012 --> 01:13:54,639
Right, Hinata?!

1090
01:13:55,348 --> 01:13:58,977
<i>He...didn't realize it...</i>

1091
01:13:59,527 --> 01:14:00,820
However...

1092
01:14:01,646 --> 01:14:06,109
those who just foolishly cheated,
naturally were disqualified.

1093
01:14:08,236 --> 01:14:09,571
That's because...

1094
01:14:10,087 --> 01:14:12,590
Information, depending on
the time and situation,

1095
01:14:12,706 --> 01:14:15,084
it will be more valuable than life.

1096
01:14:15,243 --> 01:14:17,203
And in a mission or on a battlefield,

1097
01:14:19,205 --> 01:14:21,749
you will always have to risk your life
to fight for it!

1098
01:14:23,443 --> 01:14:27,614
Horrible burn marks, nail punctures
and scratches...

1099
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:30,091
Those are signs of physical torture!

1100
01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:36,806
When information is gathered

1101
01:14:36,831 --> 01:14:38,958
and the enemy or a third party
finds out about it,

1102
01:14:39,434 --> 01:14:42,812
that information is no longer
guaranteed to be correct.

1103
01:14:44,939 --> 01:14:46,900
Just remember this.

1104
01:14:48,735 --> 01:14:51,237
To be given the wrong information

1105
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:55,116
can bring a catastrophic blow
to your friends and town.

1106
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:59,704
So that is why, out of necessity,
we forced you guys to cheat

1107
01:14:59,746 --> 01:15:02,165
in order to test your ability
to collect information.

1108
01:15:03,115 --> 01:15:08,036
And we filtered out those who
were clearly lacking in those abilities.

1109
01:15:08,838 --> 01:15:09,756
But...

1110
01:15:10,164 --> 01:15:13,251
The last question doesn't
make any sense.

1111
01:15:13,633 --> 01:15:16,888
It really is an unfair question.

1112
01:15:20,391 --> 01:15:22,852
Then, how about these two choices?

1113
01:15:23,728 --> 01:15:26,397
Let's say that you guys did
become a chunin.

1114
01:15:27,482 --> 01:15:30,026
The mission is to steal
a secret document!

1115
01:15:31,819 --> 01:15:33,321
You have no idea how many
ninja the enemy has,

1116
01:15:33,363 --> 01:15:36,658
their ability, and other armament
they may have.

1117
01:15:37,575 --> 01:15:41,745
On top of that, there maybe
the pitfall of an enemy trap.

1118
01:15:42,389 --> 01:15:45,976
Now this mission...
Will you take it? Or not take it?

1119
01:15:46,668 --> 01:15:48,311
Because you want your life spared...

1120
01:15:48,336 --> 01:15:50,672
Because your partners will
be put in danger...

1121
01:15:51,356 --> 01:15:53,608
Can you get away from
dangerous missions?

1122
01:15:54,801 --> 01:15:55,843
The answer is...

1123
01:15:59,055 --> 01:15:59,722
No!

1124
01:16:01,683 --> 01:16:03,518
There are going to be missions
you cannot avoid

1125
01:16:03,601 --> 01:16:05,562
no matter how risky or
dangerous it may be!

1126
01:16:08,398 --> 01:16:10,942
Showing your courage to
your teammates in a tight spot,

1127
01:16:11,609 --> 01:16:13,861
and the ability to get through
the hardships...

1128
01:16:17,031 --> 01:16:20,702
This is the quality that is needed
in a chunin troop leader!

1129
01:16:25,373 --> 01:16:29,711
In a pinch, there are
those who cannot risk their own fate,

1130
01:16:30,185 --> 01:16:34,023
and those who waver and give up
their chances

1131
01:16:34,048 --> 01:16:38,136
because they think they
will have another chance.

1132
01:16:38,919 --> 01:16:42,089
I believe that such fools who don't have
strong determination

1133
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:46,643
have no right to become a chunin!

1134
01:16:48,187 --> 01:16:49,814
You've passed through the gates!

1135
01:16:51,149 --> 01:16:54,611
The fist exam for the Chunin Exam
has been completed.

1136
01:16:55,704 --> 01:16:58,623
I wish you well!

1137
01:16:58,823 --> 01:17:01,492
All right! Wish us well!

1138
01:17:01,517 --> 01:17:04,061
I did it! I did it!
Yeaah!

1139
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,248
<i>What a funny guy...</i>

1140
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:18,009
<i>Gosh, this one...</i>

1141
01:17:18,509 --> 01:17:19,886
You guys!

1142
01:17:20,110 --> 01:17:22,889
This isn't the time to be
celebrating!

1143
01:17:24,182 --> 01:17:27,685
I'm the proctor for the second exam!
Anko Mitarashi!

1144
01:17:28,728 --> 01:17:30,938
Let's move onto
the next stage! Next!

1145
01:17:31,272 --> 01:17:33,274
Follow me!

1146
01:17:38,696 --> 01:17:40,239
Read the atmosphere.

1147
01:17:43,550 --> 01:17:46,845
<i>This proctor...
Is kind of like Naruto.</i>

1148
01:17:47,796 --> 01:17:52,593
78?! Ibiki!
You let 26 teams slide by?

1149
01:17:53,294 --> 01:17:56,673
I guess, the first exam this time around
was too easy.

1150
01:17:57,006 --> 01:18:00,551
It seems like this time,
there are a lot of excellent candidates.

1151
01:18:00,927 --> 01:18:03,513
I'm getting excited.

1152
01:18:04,222 --> 01:18:06,015
I'll give you the details tomorrow.

1153
01:18:06,057 --> 01:18:07,684
We'll be changing locations,

1154
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:11,854
so get information from your jonin
about the location and the time!

1155
01:18:12,814 --> 01:18:14,607
That's it. You're dismissed.

1156
01:18:31,666 --> 01:18:35,044
<i>I didn't think that there would be a guy
that would pass with a blank sheet.</i>

1157
01:18:35,837 --> 01:18:40,091
<i>Naruto Uzumaki...
He really is a funny guy.</i>

1158
01:18:44,804 --> 01:18:47,265
W-What is this place?!

1159
01:18:56,441 --> 01:18:59,277
This is the location for
the "second exam",

1160
01:18:59,793 --> 01:19:02,587
the 44th Training Field.

1161
01:19:03,448 --> 01:19:06,451
Also known as...the Forest of Death.

1162
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:11,013
The Forest of...Death?!
