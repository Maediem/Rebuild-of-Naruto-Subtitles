1
00:01:39,324 --> 00:01:40,536
I overslept!

2
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:44,578
Hey, hey! Where is everyone?

3
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:49,567
Naruto. Your Sensei wanted you
to rest and relax today...

4
00:01:51,155 --> 00:01:52,291
I knew it.

5
00:01:52,316 --> 00:01:54,062
They left me behind.

6
00:01:57,396 --> 00:01:58,189
I'll be back.

7
00:02:01,137 --> 00:02:03,268
W-What the heck is this?!

8
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:13,341
What is going on?
What's happened?

9
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,051
<i>It can't be...</i>

10
00:02:16,705 --> 00:02:18,847
Inari! Give me a hand.

11
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,324
Inari!?

12
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:21,678
I'll be right there.

13
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,537
<i>This mist...</i>

14
00:02:33,017 --> 00:02:35,436
Sasuke! Sakura!
They're coming!

15
00:02:40,996 --> 00:02:42,747
<i>I knew he was still alive.</i>

16
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,165
<i>Making an appearance so soon, eh...</i>

17
00:02:45,814 --> 00:02:46,982
Say, Kakashi Sensei.

18
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,431
This is his...
Hidden Mist Jutsu, right?!

19
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,133
<i>Sorry to have kept
you waiting, Kakashi.</i>

20
00:02:59,986 --> 00:03:02,905
<i>I see you've got those brats
with you as always.</i>

21
00:03:03,515 --> 00:03:07,227
<i>He's still trembling. Poor thing.</i>

22
00:03:17,161 --> 00:03:19,455
I'm trembling with...excitement.

23
00:03:21,584 --> 00:03:23,294
Do it, Sasuke.

24
00:03:35,246 --> 00:03:36,205
<i>I can see it!</i>

25
00:03:37,462 --> 00:03:40,424
Well well. So he could
see the Water Clones, eh.

26
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,218
That brat's grown quite a bit.

27
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,859
You might even have a rival, Haku.

28
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:48,605
So it seems.

29
00:04:01,553 --> 00:04:03,931
Damn it!
They could've woken me up!

30
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:21,511
Well, well...It seems my prediction
was right on the money.

31
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:22,904
Prediction?

32
00:04:23,274 --> 00:04:24,665
That little mask...

33
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,011
Oh!

34
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,767
I knew it...Heh!

35
00:04:28,724 --> 00:04:31,018
So the Elite Shinobi of
the Hidden Mist thing

36
00:04:31,112 --> 00:04:33,698
was a bald faced lie!

37
00:04:34,098 --> 00:04:36,767
No matter how you look at it,
he's gotta be a comrade of Zabuza.

38
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,028
Standing together with him and all...

39
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:43,074
How dare he show up like that
after what he did!

40
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,577
I hate brats who
think they're so cool...

41
00:04:46,672 --> 00:04:48,175
He's better than you, Kakashi Sensei.

42
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:49,956
Oh...really?

43
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,709
I'll do it.

44
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:53,584
Huh?

45
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:59,048
With his bad acting...
I hate brats who think they're so cool!

46
00:04:59,622 --> 00:05:01,457
Sasuke, you are so cool!

47
00:05:02,643 --> 00:05:06,662
<i>That Sakura doesn't
take stabs at Sasuke...</i>

48
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,851
He's an impressive kid.

49
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,102
Hmm...

50
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,396
Even though those Water Clones

51
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:17,150
have only 1/10th the strength
of their original...

52
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,569
To think he did so well.

53
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,914
However, you made
the preemptive move.

54
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,407
Go!

55
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:25,658
Right!

56
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,830
Are you Tazuna's daughter?

57
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,555
Sorry, but you're coming with us.

58
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,650
Mom!

59
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,279
Don't come in here!
Get out, quick!

60
00:06:04,112 --> 00:06:05,154
What's with you, brat?!

61
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,118
Should we take him, too?

62
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,746
One hostage is fine.

63
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,123
<i>Hostage...?!</i>

64
00:06:15,548 --> 00:06:16,383
Then...

65
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,544
Shall we kill him?

66
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,005
Wait!

67
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,051
If you lay a hand on that child...

68
00:06:25,602 --> 00:06:27,277
I'll bite off my tongue
and kill myself!

69
00:06:30,087 --> 00:06:32,464
You want a hostage, right?

70
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,861
Thank your mom, kid.

71
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:51,077
Oh, man...
It's not enough...

72
00:06:51,155 --> 00:06:54,617
Knock it off.
You just tried out your sword earlier.

73
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,333
Forget it already and
let's take the woman.

74
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,635
Mom, I'm sorry...

75
00:07:08,724 --> 00:07:09,665
I'm so sorry!

76
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:15,810
I'm weak, so I can't protect you...

77
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:28,526
I don't want to die...
I'm scared!

78
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,409
<i>You crybaby...</i>

79
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,456
<i>So you're just gonna cry all day
like the lead in a tragedy?</i>

80
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,627
<i>An idiot like you can just
cry forever! You crybaby!</i>

81
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,593
<i>For the things I truly hold
dear to myself...</i>

82
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:53,014
<i>I'll protect them until the end
with both these arms,</i>

83
00:07:53,227 --> 00:07:54,687
<i>even if it looks like
I might lose my life!</i>

84
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,022
<i>Inari...</i>

85
00:08:09,563 --> 00:08:10,523
Dad!

86
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:19,081
Looking at that beautiful skin
of yours makes me want to cut you.

87
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,156
Hey...walk faster.

88
00:08:21,547 --> 00:08:22,506
Wait!

89
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:26,756
Inari!

90
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,134
What?
It's just the kid from before.

91
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:35,932
Get...get away from my mom!

92
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,810
Man...This brat's hopeless.

93
00:08:40,573 --> 00:08:41,282
Let's do it!

94
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,457
If you do that, I'll bite off
my tongue and--

95
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,904
Shut up. Go to sleep.

96
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,739
I...na...ri.

97
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:03,802
The Substitution Jutsu...?!

98
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,711
The woman...Hmm?

99
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,964
Sorry I was late.

100
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,805
Heroes usually appear
on the scene late, so...

101
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,095
Naruto!

102
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,479
Inari, you did well!

103
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:24,313
Huh?

104
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:29,402
Thanks to you distracting them,
I was able to save your mom.

105
00:09:35,974 --> 00:09:39,394
Naruto...how did you know that
those thugs were here?

106
00:09:41,382 --> 00:09:44,636
In the forest, there was a boar that
had been cut up with a sword.

107
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:49,380
And on top of that,
there were trees with lots of cuts.

108
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,633
They headed in
the direction of your house...

109
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,302
so I got worried.

110
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,179
I see.

111
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,681
Well...

112
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,018
If it isn't the no good ninja
that Tazuna hired...

113
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:03,364
Let's do it...

114
00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:04,246
Yeah...

115
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:05,771
Here they come!

116
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,694
Hah!
Something like that won't work!

117
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:14,989
Fools.

118
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,956
W-Wow...!

119
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,311
I'm...sorry about yesterday.

120
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,044
Huh?

121
00:10:30,476 --> 00:10:35,397
Calling you a crybaby...
Forget I ever said that.

122
00:10:37,547 --> 00:10:39,257
You're strong!

123
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:48,856
Dang it!

124
00:10:49,352 --> 00:10:52,439
I...decided never
to cry again, but...

125
00:10:55,404 --> 00:11:03,108
Now you'll laugh at me again
and call me a crybaby.

126
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,750
It's okay...when you're happy.

127
00:11:14,064 --> 00:11:17,943
It's okay to cry when you're happy!

128
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,055
Naruto...

129
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:34,568
Now then.
I can leave the rest to you, right?

130
00:11:35,088 --> 00:11:35,672
Yeah...

131
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,407
Okay, I'm going to hop over
to the bridge for a bit.

132
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:45,718
Man, it's tough being a hero!

133
00:11:45,924 --> 00:11:46,963
Sure is!

134
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,298
Well, well...
He can keep up with that speed, eh?

135
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:58,926
Yes...

136
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:02,596
Sakura, surround Tazuna and
don't move away from me.

137
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,968
Let Sasuke handle him!

138
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:05,558
Okay.

139
00:12:06,012 --> 00:12:08,556
I don't want to have to kill you...

140
00:12:09,336 --> 00:12:11,838
I'd like for you to back down.

141
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,284
Nonsense...

142
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:15,215
I figured...

143
00:12:16,662 --> 00:12:20,957
But you won't be able to keep up
with my speed.

144
00:12:21,788 --> 00:12:25,541
And I've already made
two preemptive moves.

145
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:27,039
Two preemptive moves?

146
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,394
The first one is the scattered water.

147
00:12:31,211 --> 00:12:35,131
And the second one was
blocking one of your hands...

148
00:12:35,854 --> 00:12:40,359
Leaving you only one hand to
defend yourself from my attacks.

149
00:12:44,038 --> 00:12:45,790
A one handed Sign?

150
00:12:46,846 --> 00:12:48,389
I've never seen such a thing before...

151
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,062
<i>A Thousand Needles of Death!</i>

152
00:12:57,347 --> 00:12:59,647
<i>So he doesn't want to kill him...eh?</i>

153
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,533
<i>Remember...that training...</i>

154
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,660
<i>Build up chakra at one point...</i>

155
00:13:18,885 --> 00:13:19,803
<i>He vanished...</i>

156
00:13:26,627 --> 00:13:28,128
You're surprisingly slow...

157
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,710
<i>To think Haku would
lose in a battle of speed...</i>

158
00:13:39,123 --> 00:13:43,044
It seems that I'm faster than you...

159
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:48,994
I can't have you mocking our team,
calling them brats...

160
00:13:50,507 --> 00:13:51,550
He may not look it,

161
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,667
but Sasuke is the number one rookie
of the Hidden Leaf Village.

162
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,963
And Sakura is our sharpest...

163
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:03,843
And the other one is
the number one hyperactive,

164
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:08,180
knucklehead ninja, Naruto Uzumaki.

165
00:14:13,056 --> 00:14:14,766
Haku, do you know what this means?

166
00:14:14,935 --> 00:14:16,979
At this rate, you'll be defeated
by your intended victim...

167
00:14:17,764 --> 00:14:18,473
Yes...

168
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:23,529
What...?

169
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:26,824
It's unfortunate...

170
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:30,681
Is this...cold air...?

171
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,508
<i>Hidden Jutsu:</i>

172
00:15:03,033 --> 00:15:04,659
<i>Crystal Ice Mirrors!</i>

173
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,467
<i>Are these...mirrors?!</i>

174
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,371
Damn it!

175
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,934
I'm your opponent, aren't I?

176
00:15:36,945 --> 00:15:39,322
Now then...I'll start.

177
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:44,722
I shall show you...
my true speed!

178
00:15:57,111 --> 00:16:00,740
If you make a move,
I'll kill those two!

179
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,012
I'm sorry, Tazuna!

180
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,182
I'm stepping away
from here for a bit.

181
00:16:17,152 --> 00:16:19,112
Sure. Go!

182
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,676
Take this!

183
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:44,420
What?!

184
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,527
<i>That idiot...what a showoff...</i>

185
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:54,796
The number one hyperactive,
knucklehead ninja...

186
00:17:04,712 --> 00:17:06,130
Naruto Uzumaki...

187
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,162
is finally here!

188
00:17:11,316 --> 00:17:12,150
Oh...

189
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,168
Naruto!

190
00:17:13,422 --> 00:17:18,260
The hero of a story generally appears
in this kind of situation

191
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,540
and takes out the enemy in no time!

192
00:17:21,565 --> 00:17:23,900
<i>Heh...That brat, eh...</i>

193
00:17:24,903 --> 00:17:26,487
<i>Man, that idiot!</i>

194
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:28,937
<i>Making such a conspicuous entrance...</i>

195
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,967
<i>There's no point if you don't
catch the enemy off guard!</i>

196
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:35,888
<i>That boy...</i>

197
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:39,545
All right, here I go!
<i>Shadow Clone</i>...

198
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:43,979
Whoa!

199
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:44,949
What?!

200
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,361
Haku...what are you doing?

201
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:55,074
Zabuza, leave this kid to me...

202
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:59,036
Please let me fight this battle my way.

203
00:18:09,615 --> 00:18:14,245
So, you don't want me interfering?

204
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,474
You're naive...as usual...

205
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,352
I'm sorry...

206
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,562
<i>Naive, eh...</i>

207
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,481
<i>True enough...</i>

208
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,025
<i>Judging from these wounds,</i>

209
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,528
<i>there's no mistaking that
I was attacked with a senbon.</i>

210
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,115
<i>But no vital areas have
been targeted so far.</i>

211
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,413
<i>It's impossible.
He's too much for Naruto!</i>

212
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,624
<i>I should be the one to...</i>

213
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,503
Hey. Don't get any ideas...

214
00:18:50,354 --> 00:18:52,064
If you move,

215
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,175
you know what'll happen
to that old man, right?

216
00:18:56,893 --> 00:18:57,894
<i>True...</i>

217
00:18:58,862 --> 00:19:00,405
How about it?

218
00:19:00,623 --> 00:19:05,754
Let's just see how those young guys
fight against each other.

219
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,897
That mask...

220
00:19:09,141 --> 00:19:12,186
You were Zabuza's comrade, after all,
weren't you!

221
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:15,346
You've got nerve to deceive us!

222
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:17,573
I'm sorry.

223
00:19:19,078 --> 00:19:22,539
Things like deceiving and catching
one off guard is a shinobi's duty.

224
00:19:23,404 --> 00:19:25,489
Please don't take it personally.

225
00:19:28,423 --> 00:19:31,343
<i>You don't have that luxury, either!</i>

226
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:37,676
I haven't...forgotten about you.

227
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,636
<i>Sasuke?</i>

228
00:19:40,715 --> 00:19:44,969
I would rather you had
just gone down quietly.

229
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,352
But it looks like it won't work
that way.

230
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,397
Fine. I'll put an end to you first.

231
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,817
H-Hey!

232
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:57,804
Naruto. I'll get to you later.

233
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:00,657
<i>This is it!</i>

234
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,334
<i>So the real body is over there, eh...</i>

235
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,251
<i>Okay!</i>

236
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:12,794
I'm over here.

237
00:20:17,572 --> 00:20:20,324
<i>He moved? How?!</i>

238
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:29,733
<i>What kind of jutsu is he using?</i>

239
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:34,650
<i>It's possible that he has clones
hidden in the mirrors and</i>

240
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:37,294
<i>has them all throw
senbons simultaneously...</i>

241
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:39,504
<i>No, they're too fast...</i>

242
00:20:39,725 --> 00:20:40,881
<i>I can't even see...</i>

243
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,616
<i>the trajectory of his attacks.</i>

244
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:48,747
<i>Also, if was a mere Clone Jutsu...</i>

245
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:52,084
<i>I don't see a need for
these ice mirrors...</i>

246
00:20:52,402 --> 00:20:53,945
<i>Looks like our best bet...</i>

247
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:59,568
<i>Is for me to attack from the inside
while Naruto attacks from outside...</i>

248
00:20:59,965 --> 00:21:02,050
Yo! I came to save you.

249
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:06,056
You okay, Sasuke?

250
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,851
Y-You idiot!

251
00:21:10,115 --> 00:21:13,034
If you're a shinobi,
you should move more cautiously!

252
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:14,518
What's with you?!

253
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,496
I came to the rescue, you know!

254
00:21:16,521 --> 00:21:18,273
If we're both inside the mirrors...

255
00:21:19,644 --> 00:21:22,308
Forget it!
I've had it, you idiot!

256
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,907
Idiot?
What do you mean idiot?!

257
00:21:25,178 --> 00:21:28,140
<i>As to be expected of the
number one unpredictable ninja.</i>

258
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,541
<i>Him "helping" just made the
situation far worse...</i>

259
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:35,878
It looks like, our only
option left is to smash the mirrors!

260
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:38,105
<i>Fire Style:</i>

261
00:21:38,189 --> 00:21:39,982
Hey! What're you going to do?!

262
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,843
These are mirrors made of ice...

263
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:43,800
So...

264
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,971
<i>Fireball Jutsu!</i>

265
00:21:56,846 --> 00:21:58,932
It's not working at all!

266
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:02,195
They won't melt with that
level of firepower.

267
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:20,255
Damn! Where'd he attack from?!
Are they all clones?

268
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,819
Where's the real body?!

269
00:22:26,528 --> 00:22:29,072
It's useless for you to even
attempt following with your eyes.

270
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,308
I absolutely will not be caught.

271
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:34,311
Humph.
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

272
00:22:34,488 --> 00:22:35,406
Don't!

273
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:41,985
Even so, I'll find out which is
the real body by hitting them all!

274
00:22:57,372 --> 00:23:02,919
This is a teleportation Jutsu that uses
mirrors reflect only my image.

275
00:23:03,561 --> 00:23:05,355
I move so quickly...

276
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,216
that to me, you two might
as well be standing still.

277
00:23:08,923 --> 00:23:10,562
Is that Jutsu...a kekkei genkai?!

278
00:23:13,343 --> 00:23:15,387
Kekkei...genkai?

279
00:23:15,412 --> 00:23:17,684
It's the same as my Sharingan...

280
00:23:17,709 --> 00:23:22,029
Deep blood ties...
Lineage of paranormal individuals...

281
00:23:22,447 --> 00:23:25,074
A type of jutsu that is passed down,
generation to generation.

282
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:29,741
It's impossible for even me
to copy something like that...

283
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:35,038
Damn it...

284
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,042
So...what?!

285
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,712
I can't die here like this.

286
00:23:43,272 --> 00:23:46,650
'Cause I have a dream
that I must turn into reality...

287
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:50,429
The dream to have my strength recognized
by everyone in the village...

288
00:23:50,454 --> 00:23:52,782
and become the Hokage!

289
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:54,474
<i>A dream...</i>

290
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,314
I find it difficult to
completely embrace being a Shinobi...

291
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:05,610
If I can help it,
I don't want to kill you two...

292
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,613
And I don't want to be killed
by you two...

293
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,909
But if you guys are
going to come at me...

294
00:24:13,331 --> 00:24:17,210
I'll kill my feelings with my blade,
and completely become a Shinobi.

295
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:22,127
This bridge is the battleground
that connects each of us to our dreams.

296
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,338
I, for the sake of my dream.

297
00:24:25,808 --> 00:24:28,311
And you, for the sake of yours.

298
00:24:29,517 --> 00:24:30,977
Please don't hold it against me...

299
00:24:32,065 --> 00:24:34,150
I want to protect the person
I care for the most...

300
00:24:35,393 --> 00:24:39,564
I live for the sake of that person,
I fight for that person,

301
00:24:39,953 --> 00:24:42,080
and I want to make that
person's dream a reality...

302
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:43,982
That's my dream.

303
00:24:44,463 --> 00:24:47,592
For the sake of the dream,
I will completely become a Shinobi...

304
00:24:47,979 --> 00:24:49,881
and kill you both!

305
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:58,830
Sasuke! Naruto!
Don't lose to a guy like that!

306
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,500
Stop it, Sakura.
Don't encourage them!

307
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:02,667
What?

308
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,796
Even if there was a chance that
we could break that technique,

309
00:25:07,325 --> 00:25:10,152
they won't be able to defeat that boy.

310
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,345
W-What do you mean?

311
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:19,267
They don't have the mentality
to kill their feelings...

312
00:25:19,424 --> 00:25:21,676
and take another's life.

313
00:25:22,882 --> 00:25:24,175
Exactly...

314
00:25:25,116 --> 00:25:30,830
No real shinobi will come out of
a peace-addicted village like yours.

315
00:25:31,745 --> 00:25:34,581
Because they are not able to learn

316
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:37,751
the "experience of killing"!

317
00:25:39,011 --> 00:25:40,372
I'm sorry but...

318
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,543
I'm going to have to finish
this in an instant.

319
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,004
The Sharingan again?

320
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:50,416
Such an unimaginative guy!

321
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:00,350
You might call me
"an unimaginative guy,"

322
00:26:01,107 --> 00:26:04,099
but at the end of the day,
you're just afraid of the Sharingan.

323
00:26:05,234 --> 00:26:07,403
The secret technique of a shinobi...

324
00:26:07,601 --> 00:26:11,063
isn't something that you show
your opponent so many times.

325
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:12,629
Be appreciative.

326
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,934
You're the only who has had
the chance to see it twice...

327
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,724
And there will not be a third time...

328
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:26,251
Even if you were able to defeat me,
you can't defeat Haku...

329
00:26:26,422 --> 00:26:28,870
Since he was a kid,

330
00:26:29,074 --> 00:26:32,509
I've been painstakingly teaching him
the battle techniques of the ninja!

331
00:26:51,294 --> 00:26:54,631
All of my techniques.

332
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,534
On top of that...

333
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,537
He has been polishing up
his own skills as well!

334
00:27:05,905 --> 00:27:08,741
His jutsu surpasses even me!

335
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:12,964
That's the terrifying ability of
his kekkei genkai.

336
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:17,427
Thus, I have
forged the ultimate tool.

337
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:21,431
He is...
He is the best tool!

338
00:27:21,594 --> 00:27:25,098
There's nothing more boring
than listening to someone brag...

339
00:27:25,361 --> 00:27:27,989
It's about time...
I make my move.

340
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:31,191
Now, now.
As long as we're talking...

341
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,818
Let me brag about another thing...

342
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,908
<i>I know...
Zabuza...</i>

343
00:27:40,737 --> 00:27:42,530
<i>I'll finish them off soon enough...</i>

344
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,954
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

345
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:48,917
<i>You just don't learn, do you?!</i>

346
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:14,187
<i>He read my movement...
There's no way he could do that...</i>

347
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:20,990
<i>This is good!</i>

348
00:28:21,015 --> 00:28:23,351
<i>Bit by bit, I'm figuring out
the timing...</i>

349
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:26,719
Damn! We were so close!

350
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,332
Naruto, can you still move?

351
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:32,752
Of course! I'm totally fine!

352
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:36,673
<i>He's exhausted,
and it's no wonder.</i>

353
00:28:36,931 --> 00:28:39,725
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu uses
a lot of chakra.</i>

354
00:28:40,347 --> 00:28:42,432
<i>But thanks to him,
I found our way out.</i>

355
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,764
<i>Hah! Impossible!</i>

356
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,893
<i>It was just a coincidence.</i>

357
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,848
Naruto! Run!

358
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:54,816
What?

359
00:28:54,841 --> 00:28:57,218
Run out of here and
attack from the outside!

360
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:00,155
A-All right!

361
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,533
I won't let you!

362
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,505
I-I'm not going to lose!

363
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:21,593
<i>There!</i>

364
00:29:21,618 --> 00:29:23,620
<i>Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!</i>

365
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,159
Damn!

366
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:48,828
T-That was good just now!

367
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:49,829
What?

368
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:52,123
We're doing it one more time!

369
00:29:53,336 --> 00:29:54,713
All right!

370
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,619
<i>There has to be a limit
to that guy's chakra, too!</i>

371
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,009
This won't go as you've planned.

372
00:30:04,132 --> 00:30:05,633
<i>First, I'll get you!</i>

373
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:15,774
I've been anxious to copy your line.

374
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:22,362
"I'll tell you now, the same jutsu
won't work on me twice."

375
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,863
Was that it...?

376
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:28,326
<i>Ninja Art: Hidden Mist Jutsu!</i>

377
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:37,877
<i>This is?!</i>

378
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:41,714
Sakura! Stay with Tazuna!

379
00:30:43,655 --> 00:30:44,656
Huh?

380
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:46,469
Oh! Sakura!

381
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:51,099
Mr. Tazuna, no matter what,
don't move away from me!

382
00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:53,436
Yeah...you got it.

383
00:30:54,209 --> 00:30:56,962
<i>I know it's called Hidden Mist,
but this fog is way too thick...</i>

384
00:30:57,991 --> 00:31:00,494
<i>Even Zabuza himself shouldn't
be able to see anything...</i>

385
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,740
Good job on dodging it...

386
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,118
Just what I expect of Kakashi
of the Sharingan...

387
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,097
<i>He's...</i>

388
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:14,998
<i>closing his eyes!</i>

389
00:31:15,445 --> 00:31:18,239
But...the next time you see me,

390
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,545
will be the end.

391
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:24,299
You overvalue the Sharingan.

392
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,216
What...?

393
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:31,139
You spoke as if you saw through
everything, but...

394
00:31:31,712 --> 00:31:35,090
Your foresight was wrong, after all.

395
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,103
Kakashi...

396
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,982
You can't read my mind or
my future...

397
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,067
You're a fruad.

398
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,821
First I vanish into the thick fog,

399
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,641
and make your
perceptive eyes useless...

400
00:31:52,546 --> 00:31:56,139
With my eyes closed, I shut down your
ability to use your hypnotic eye

401
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,832
in a close distance battle.

402
00:31:59,613 --> 00:32:00,698
But...

403
00:32:00,931 --> 00:32:03,350
That also means that
you can't see.

404
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:05,965
Did you forget?

405
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:09,761
That I am a master
of Silent Killing,

406
00:32:09,786 --> 00:32:12,926
and can find
my target just by sound.

407
00:32:15,001 --> 00:32:19,631
<i>Damn! It's been a while since
I've fought in such bad conditions.</i>

408
00:32:21,416 --> 00:32:23,794
<i>And I'm worried about
Sasuke and Naruto, too...</i>

409
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:32,367
<i>Be calm...Think...
Who will he target now...</i>

410
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:34,494
<i>Oh no!</i>

411
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,291
What?!

412
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:41,501
Too late!

413
00:32:49,545 --> 00:32:51,714
<i>That was Sakura's voice!</i>

414
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,930
<i>Did something happen?</i>

415
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:57,141
<i>What's Kakashi doing?</i>

416
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,772
Sa...kura...

417
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,942
Can you stand up, Naruto?

418
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,902
Y-Yeah...

419
00:33:07,984 --> 00:33:09,861
From now on,
don't waste your chakra!

420
00:33:10,277 --> 00:33:11,945
You'll be playing
right into his hands.

421
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:15,546
I know.

422
00:33:17,213 --> 00:33:18,297
<i>Crap!</i>

423
00:33:18,386 --> 00:33:20,723
<i>If things continue like this,
things are going to get really bad.</i>

424
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:21,791
<i>I...</i>

425
00:33:21,913 --> 00:33:23,832
<i>I have to do something.</i>

426
00:33:26,932 --> 00:33:28,976
My eyes have begun to adjust...

427
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:33,105
It's about the time I put
an end to this for you...

428
00:33:37,613 --> 00:33:38,447
<i>What?!</i>

429
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,813
Stand up, you idiot!

430
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:51,921
<i>I was aiming for a vital spot...
but he blocked them all.</i>

431
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,993
I know...you're so persistent!

432
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:04,632
<i>A coincidence...
No, that's not it.</i>

433
00:34:04,885 --> 00:34:10,099
<i>On the contrary, he's fighting
while covering for his friend.</i>

434
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:14,385
<i>That boy...he can see something.</i>

435
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,263
<i>What in the world...?</i>

436
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:19,974
Okay, in that case...

437
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,351
He disappeared.

438
00:34:22,521 --> 00:34:24,690
Where, where did he disappear to?!

439
00:34:25,224 --> 00:34:27,309
Naruto! Don't faint!

440
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:30,276
I can't take care of you
any more than I am now!

441
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:33,279
Who asked you to take care of me...

442
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:40,828
It seems that kid has
reached his limits.

443
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,377
You move well...

444
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:49,796
Wha?!

445
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,673
But I'll stop you
with the next one.

446
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:56,844
<i>Calm down...</i>

447
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,263
<i>Focus!</i>

448
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:14,862
<i>He saw through
absolutely everything?!</i>

449
00:35:16,296 --> 00:35:17,215
<i>No way...</i>

450
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:29,959
<i>Those eyes...</i>

451
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:31,921
<i>It can't be...</i>

452
00:35:34,283 --> 00:35:35,284
<i>Sharingan...</i>

453
00:35:39,341 --> 00:35:40,468
You're...

454
00:35:41,128 --> 00:35:42,463
<i>It was just for a moment...</i>

455
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,059
<i>But I was able to see!</i>

456
00:35:47,139 --> 00:35:51,352
<i>I'm sure, to a certain extent,
his eyes can already see me.</i>

457
00:35:54,954 --> 00:35:57,624
<i>It would be foolish to aim
straight at him.</i>

458
00:35:58,826 --> 00:35:59,869
<i>In that case...</i>

459
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:05,089
<i>I'll use that kid as bait.</i>

460
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,373
<i>What?!</i>

461
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,375
<i>Let me make it in time!</i>

462
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:19,468
Your desire to help
those kids has gone to your head,

463
00:36:19,568 --> 00:36:22,029
and it seems to have clouded
your Sharingan

464
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,723
with even heavier fog.

465
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,768
Even though you have
those impressive eyes,

466
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:31,377
your ability to read your enemy's
movements is getting cloudy.

467
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:36,569
Amuse me more, Kakashi...

468
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,656
I want to repay my debt in
an amusing way.

469
00:36:41,907 --> 00:36:48,289
Don't worry. Haku should be
finished with those brats anytime now.

470
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:55,641
You better beg for their forgiveness...

471
00:36:55,666 --> 00:36:59,753
when you reunite in the after-life!

472
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:19,487
Sasuke...defeated...?

473
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,657
That's not true!

474
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:24,659
Sasuke is...

475
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:25,993
<i>Cha!</i>

476
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,329
Not by that guy!

477
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,331
<i>Cha!</i>

478
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,208
He won't be defeated!

479
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:34,835
<i>Cha!</i>

480
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,253
Naruto won't be either!

481
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:38,923
That's right.

482
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:39,799
Huh!

483
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:47,348
I...believe in their strength.

484
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,143
Naruto is the number one,
hyperactive, knucklehead ninja...

485
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:58,058
And Sasuke is a member of
the most prestigious clan

486
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,736
in the Hidden Leaf Village!

487
00:38:02,234 --> 00:38:03,235
You don't mean?!

488
00:38:04,496 --> 00:38:08,667
Yes...
His name is Sasuke Uchiha...

489
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,163
He's a ninja genius.

490
00:38:13,648 --> 00:38:17,735
He's the sole survivor
of that tragic clan?!

491
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:20,715
No wonder he grows so quickly.

492
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:23,160
But...

493
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,512
That's the same for Haku.

494
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,309
Nobody has ever beaten
Haku's secret jutsu.

495
00:38:32,416 --> 00:38:34,252
Not a single person...

496
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,939
Well then...

497
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,026
It's about time
I put an end to this, huh?

498
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:46,877
No, I'm going to put
an end to this!

499
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,086
For God's sake, you...

500
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:04,216
just won't quit...
getting in my way, will you?

501
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,302
You did it!
Sasuke...!

502
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:19,231
W-What kind of expression
is that...

503
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:25,196
You...idiot...!

504
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,574
W-Why...

505
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,578
Did you protect me...?!

506
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:38,292
How the hell...should I know?

507
00:40:10,014 --> 00:40:11,015
Hmph...

508
00:40:11,732 --> 00:40:12,941
You know...

509
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,621
I hated you...

510
00:40:17,888 --> 00:40:20,933
Why? Why...?

511
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:24,088
Why...me...?

512
00:40:25,834 --> 00:40:27,336
I don't know...

513
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:32,410
My body just...moved on it's own...

514
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,140
Idiot!

515
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,114
Sasuke!

516
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,775
That man...

517
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:51,490
Until I defeated...my brother...

518
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,203
I wouldn't die...

519
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:58,947
That's what I swore, but...

520
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:08,507
Don't you dare die.

521
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:45,586
He was a shinobi worthy of respect.

522
00:41:48,311 --> 00:41:50,980
Is this the first time
a friend has died?

523
00:41:52,173 --> 00:41:54,842
This is the way of the shinobi...

524
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:01,602
Shut up!

525
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:16,534
I'm going to kill you!

526
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,794
<i>What is this chakra?!</i>

527
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:32,508
<i>Impossible...</i>

528
00:42:33,671 --> 00:42:35,840
<i>His chakra is
physically manifesting itself!</i>

529
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:41,892
<i>A-And...what a ghastly chakra it is...</i>

530
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,952
<i>The wounds on his hand...
are healing instantly...</i>

531
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,955
<i>This boy...</i>

532
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,124
<i>What the hell is he...?</i>

533
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:15,301
<i>It can't be!</i>

534
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,970
<i>What is...this chakra?</i>

535
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:20,222
<i>It feels foul...</i>

536
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:25,352
<i>Kakashi?
No, it's too big to be Kakashi's...</i>

537
00:43:26,808 --> 00:43:27,684
<i>Who is it?</i>

538
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,926
<i>There's murder in his eyes!</i>

539
00:43:58,347 --> 00:44:00,391
<i>He looks nothing like he used to!</i>

540
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,223
<i>He's coming!</i>

541
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:08,812
<i>What?</i>

542
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:12,775
<i>His chakra repelled my attack!</i>

543
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:14,818
<i>Then...</i>

544
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:27,915
<i>This should do it!</i>

545
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:34,838
<i>Why?!</i>

546
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:40,260
<i>It can't be!</i>

547
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,894
<i>Could...Naruto's seal
have been broken...?!</i>

548
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:51,689
<i>No.</i>

549
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:52,773
<i>This feeling...</i>

550
00:44:53,952 --> 00:44:55,704
<i>It hasn't completely broken...</i>

551
00:44:56,123 --> 00:44:59,292
<i>The chakra of the Nine-Tailed
Fox is escaping...</i>

552
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:04,034
<i>But the seal
has only slipped a little!</i>

553
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,080
<i>I still have some time!</i>

554
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,328
Do you hear me, Zabuza?

555
00:45:12,059 --> 00:45:13,393
We're both busy people.

556
00:45:14,443 --> 00:45:16,320
I know it's against your style,

557
00:45:16,893 --> 00:45:19,479
but how about
we stopped playing around.

558
00:45:22,727 --> 00:45:25,188
Why don't we settle this once
and for all with one final move?

559
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:27,057
Interesting.

560
00:45:27,712 --> 00:45:30,465
What can you possibly
do in this situation?

561
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:33,272
Kakashi, go ahead.
Show me.

562
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,155
<i>No good...</i>

563
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:43,490
<i>I can't hold this chakra down!</i>

564
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,160
<i>Zabuza...</i>

565
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:34,374
<i>I can't defeat this boy.</i>

566
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,087
<i>Zabuza...</i>

567
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:43,717
<i>I'm...</i>

568
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:00,859
You're...that kid...

569
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:03,779
Why?

570
00:47:04,205 --> 00:47:05,165
Why did you stop?

571
00:47:06,594 --> 00:47:12,767
I just killed your dear friend,
and you can't kill me?

572
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:22,589
Damn it!

573
00:47:30,567 --> 00:47:33,031
What happened to all
that power from a moment ago?

574
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:38,730
You can't kill me with
that kind of strength.

575
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:42,985
Wasn't he someone
special to you?

576
00:47:45,158 --> 00:47:47,952
<i>Is there someone special
in your life?</i>

577
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,368
<i>I want to protect someone
special to me.</i>

578
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:54,371
<i>I want to make that
person's dream a reality...</i>

579
00:47:55,136 --> 00:47:56,596
<i>That's my dream.</i>

580
00:47:58,608 --> 00:48:02,070
People often misunderstand...

581
00:48:03,378 --> 00:48:06,882
They show pity and don't finish off
the enemy they ought to finish.

582
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:09,177
They let them survive.

583
00:48:10,799 --> 00:48:14,970
To me, that isn't compassion
or anything.

584
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:18,353
Do you know...

585
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:22,524
How it feels to
not be needed by anyone?

586
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:26,320
To live each day without a dream.
The pain of it all.

587
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:28,870
What are you saying?

588
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:33,577
Zabuza has no use
for a weak Shinobi.

589
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:37,247
You took away
my reason for existence.

590
00:48:38,252 --> 00:48:39,169
Why?

591
00:48:39,574 --> 00:48:41,493
Why do you have to
serve a guy like that?

592
00:48:41,738 --> 00:48:45,742
He gets money from thugs
to do bad things!

593
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:50,469
Is that No-Brow really
the only person special to you?

594
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:56,058
A long time ago,
I had other people special to me.

595
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:01,229
They were...my parents.

596
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:10,072
I was born in the Land of Water,
in a small village heavy with snow.

597
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:14,111
My parents worked on a small farm.

598
00:49:14,249 --> 00:49:16,293
We were very poor,

599
00:49:16,464 --> 00:49:19,384
but my parents seemed to
be satisfied with it.

600
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:22,960
I was happy then...

601
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,671
They were loving parents.

602
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:29,216
But...

603
00:49:30,131 --> 00:49:32,133
When I was old enough
to understand things,

604
00:49:33,056 --> 00:49:34,849
something happened.

605
00:49:35,428 --> 00:49:36,345
Like what?

606
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:38,225
What happened?

607
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:46,066
My blood...

608
00:49:46,672 --> 00:49:47,548
Blood?

609
00:49:50,228 --> 00:49:51,229
Go on!

610
00:49:51,584 --> 00:49:53,795
Tell me what happened.

611
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:58,453
My father...
He killed my mother.

612
00:49:59,088 --> 00:50:01,293
Then he tried to kill me.

613
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:02,276
Huh?!

614
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:08,296
For generations, the Land of Mist
has seen endless civil wars.

615
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:12,899
People with kekkei genkai were
hated and feared in the Land of Water.

616
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:15,137
Kekkei genkai?

617
00:50:16,051 --> 00:50:19,971
It's a special power or jutsu
passed on through certain clans,

618
00:50:20,063 --> 00:50:25,109
from parent to child,
or from grandparent to grandchild.

619
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:28,483
Because of their special powers,

620
00:50:29,084 --> 00:50:33,130
those who had kekkei genkai
were exploited in all sorts of battles.

621
00:50:33,499 --> 00:50:37,221
As a result, all kekkei genkai
were feared

622
00:50:37,246 --> 00:50:39,172
as harbingers of disaster
and death.

623
00:50:43,188 --> 00:50:44,398
After the wars were over,

624
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:49,296
people with kekkei genkai
were hunted down and killed.

625
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:55,510
To survive, we were forced to hide
the existence of our bloodline traits.

626
00:50:57,012 --> 00:51:01,016
I'm sure that boy went through
something similar as well.

627
00:51:01,882 --> 00:51:05,719
The greater your power,
the more you were feared.

628
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:11,401
My mother had a kekkei genkai.

629
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:14,571
She kept it secret from my father.

630
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:16,490
She hoped that--

631
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:21,369
No, she must have thought that
they could have a simple life forever.

632
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:29,586
<i>Look, Mommy! Look!</i>

633
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:32,881
<i>Isn't it fantastic?</i>

634
00:51:35,283 --> 00:51:36,660
<i>Not you, too!</i>

635
00:51:36,784 --> 00:51:39,038
<i>Why? Why him, too?</i>

636
00:51:39,063 --> 00:51:40,587
<i>That hurts, Mommy!</i>

637
00:51:46,357 --> 00:51:47,316
<i>Sorry...</i>

638
00:51:48,392 --> 00:51:50,434
<i>I'm sorry, Haku...</i>

639
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:52,609
<i>I'm sorry!</i>

640
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:56,171
However...

641
00:51:56,463 --> 00:52:00,426
Father had discovered our secret.

642
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,095
My father...

643
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:04,848
Was killed by my own hands.

644
00:53:06,895 --> 00:53:11,316
And at that moment,
I knew what I was.

645
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:14,733
That I...

646
00:53:15,084 --> 00:53:19,922
that my existence didn't matter
to anyone else in the world.

647
00:53:21,189 --> 00:53:23,483
<i>That's...how I felt.</i>

648
00:53:24,015 --> 00:53:26,976
You told me that...

649
00:53:27,313 --> 00:53:31,609
You'd be the best ninja in the village,
and make everyone respect you.

650
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:37,283
If someone comes along and
accepts you for who you are,

651
00:53:37,308 --> 00:53:41,980
no one could be more important
to you than that person.

652
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:48,694
Even though he knew I was from
a clan with a kekkei genkai,

653
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:51,263
Zabuza took me in.

654
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:57,567
The power that everyone hated...
He wanted it, needed it.

655
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:05,617
<i>Brats like you won't be needed
by anyone and die like dogs.</i>

656
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:13,833
<i>You have the same eyes as I do...</i>

657
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:21,758
<i>Brat...</i>

658
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:26,304
<i>Do you want...
to be needed by someone?</i>

659
00:54:28,594 --> 00:54:32,723
<i>Are you willing
to give everything for me?</i>

660
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,158
<i>From now on,
you belong to me.</i>

661
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,466
<i>Come with me.</i>

662
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:10,765
I was so happy...

663
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,853
<i>Haku, bad news.</i>

664
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:19,316
<i>I have to leave the
Land of Water tonight.</i>

665
00:55:20,995 --> 00:55:25,041
<i>But, I'll be back some day.</i>

666
00:55:25,699 --> 00:55:28,234
<i>I will rule over this land.</i>

667
00:55:28,974 --> 00:55:30,684
<i>To do that...</i>

668
00:55:30,996 --> 00:55:35,543
<i>what I need isn't consolation,
encouragement or empty words.</i>

669
00:55:36,285 --> 00:55:37,954
<i>What I really need is...</i>

670
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:39,561
<i>I already know.</i>

671
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:40,962
<i>You have nothing to fear.</i>

672
00:55:41,335 --> 00:55:43,670
<i>I am your weapon, Zabuza.</i>

673
00:55:43,857 --> 00:55:48,194
<i>Keep me by you as a mere tool
that heeds your every word.</i>

674
00:55:50,746 --> 00:55:52,039
<i>You're a good boy!</i>

675
00:55:54,054 --> 00:55:56,139
I apologize, Zabuza.

676
00:55:56,905 --> 00:56:00,659
I wasn't good enough...
Your tool failed you.

677
00:56:09,649 --> 00:56:10,858
I want you...

678
00:56:11,268 --> 00:56:12,686
to kill me.

679
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:19,501
<i>Ninja Art: Summoning!
Earth Style: Fanged Pursuit Jutsu!</i>

680
00:56:27,235 --> 00:56:29,404
Whatever you're doing won't work!

681
00:56:29,833 --> 00:56:33,503
You have absolutely no idea
where I am now.

682
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:34,641
On the other hand...

683
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:39,687
I know exactly where you are.

684
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:41,106
Kakashi...

685
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:45,443
You are completely
in my hands now.

686
00:57:01,362 --> 00:57:04,323
If you can't use your eyes or ears,
simply use your nose.

687
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,315
That's what happens

688
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:10,093
when you're closing your eyes
in the midst of fog.

689
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:13,346
This is the Summoning Jutsu
specialized for pursuit.

690
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,976
I deliberately shed my own blood

691
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:20,504
while stopping both of
your attacks before.

692
00:57:21,127 --> 00:57:25,298
Your weapons have a thick scent of
my blood on them now.

693
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:29,253
Those are my adorable Ninja Dogs.

694
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:31,531
And their sense of smell
is without equal.

695
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:34,784
You're the one who
was playing into my hands.

696
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:39,914
The fog has lifted already.

697
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:43,793
And your future is...
death.

698
00:57:45,388 --> 00:57:47,181
I've had enough of your bluffs!

699
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:48,882
Don't act tough!

700
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:52,760
There's nothing you can do
in this situation.

701
00:57:53,326 --> 00:57:55,412
Your death is certain.

702
00:57:57,817 --> 00:57:58,818
Zabuza.

703
00:57:58,843 --> 00:58:00,678
You were too full of yourself.

704
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:04,063
You're too ambitious
for your own good.

705
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:18,286
You assassinated the Mizukage,
but failed to pull off a coup.

706
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:22,671
You left the service with
few men under you,

707
00:58:22,996 --> 00:58:25,039
and became a rogue ninja.

708
00:58:25,623 --> 00:58:29,776
Soon after, your name reached
our Hidden Leaf Village.

709
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:32,692
You needed to raise funds
to strike back.

710
00:58:33,165 --> 00:58:35,069
And you needed to hide from

711
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:36,763
the Tracking Unit's
pursuit and retaliation.

712
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:38,932
Isn't that about the reason

713
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:42,508
why you hired yourself out
to scum like Gato?

714
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:44,646
Zabuza.

715
00:58:44,951 --> 00:58:49,038
Do you really believe I've managed
to survive with just the Sharingan?

716
00:58:50,451 --> 00:58:54,997
Here's something I didn't copy,
a jutsu of my own...

717
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:57,450
To enlighten you!

718
00:59:08,112 --> 00:59:09,243
<i>Lightning Blade!</i>

719
00:59:10,029 --> 00:59:11,156
<i>What the...?!</i>

720
00:59:11,657 --> 00:59:14,827
<i>His hand is visibly overflowing
with chakra!</i>

721
00:59:18,004 --> 00:59:20,548
Your future is...death!

722
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:27,238
Naruto...

723
00:59:27,782 --> 00:59:29,283
I want you to kill me.

724
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:34,279
Please, make it quick.

725
00:59:39,292 --> 00:59:41,586
What are you hesitating for?

726
00:59:41,797 --> 00:59:43,341
I just don't get it!

727
00:59:43,693 --> 00:59:48,436
The only reason you are allowed
to live is because you stay strong?

728
00:59:49,867 --> 00:59:52,078
There must be something other
than just fighting...

729
00:59:52,103 --> 00:59:53,356
There must be some other way

730
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:55,842
for you to make
the others accept you!

731
00:59:57,302 --> 01:00:01,631
Remember when we met at the forest?
Do you know what I thought?

732
01:00:02,412 --> 01:00:03,685
That you and I are much alike.

733
01:00:06,523 --> 01:00:08,233
I'm sure you can relate to me.

734
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:14,360
I apologize for dirtying
your hands with my blood.

735
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:16,696
Is that it?

736
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:19,949
Is there really no other way?

737
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:23,036
Correct.

738
01:00:27,093 --> 01:00:30,137
If only...we had met under
different circumstances,

739
01:00:30,442 --> 01:00:32,278
we could've been friends.

740
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:42,764
<i>I...I hope your dream comes true.</i>

741
01:00:44,012 --> 01:00:45,889
<i>Him too...</i>

742
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:50,229
<i>Sasuke also had dreams of his own!</i>

743
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:02,241
<i>Thank you...
You will become stronger.</i>

744
01:01:04,343 --> 01:01:05,178
Hmm...

745
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:08,081
The super thick fog
has finally begun to clear.

746
01:01:10,678 --> 01:01:11,971
There are two over there!

747
01:01:12,309 --> 01:01:13,436
They are facing off each other.

748
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:14,253
Huh?

749
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:16,381
I can't see well...

750
01:01:17,505 --> 01:01:19,173
Which one is Kakashi Sensei...

751
01:01:20,856 --> 01:01:21,815
One moved!

752
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:26,933
Huh?

753
01:01:37,342 --> 01:01:39,136
Forgive me, Naruto...

754
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:47,328
I cannot die yet!

755
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:02,593
<i>Is this the end...?</i>

756
01:02:50,458 --> 01:02:51,918
Zabuza...

757
01:02:55,852 --> 01:02:58,814
Didn't you say my future
was death?

758
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:04,762
You're off the mark again, Kakashi!

759
01:03:05,714 --> 01:03:06,456
Old man!

760
01:03:07,306 --> 01:03:08,724
Old Man Giichi!

761
01:03:08,821 --> 01:03:10,406
Please open up!

762
01:03:11,844 --> 01:03:13,512
Let's go to the bridge!

763
01:03:13,636 --> 01:03:15,263
If we all do it together,

764
01:03:15,288 --> 01:03:17,582
we can beat Gato and
his men this time!

765
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:20,046
Inari...

766
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,591
I made up my mind not
to fight anymore.

767
01:03:24,678 --> 01:03:26,305
Your father...

768
01:03:27,598 --> 01:03:29,641
was a hero...

769
01:03:30,655 --> 01:03:32,168
But even he's not with us anymore.

770
01:03:35,097 --> 01:03:38,768
If we were to fight,
we'd just be throwing our lives away.

771
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:43,152
None of us wants to lose anymore...

772
01:03:44,642 --> 01:03:47,896
No one wants to regret again.

773
01:03:48,173 --> 01:03:50,175
I finally realized...

774
01:03:51,023 --> 01:03:54,193
Nothing is accomplished if
I just cry all the time!

775
01:03:54,958 --> 01:03:56,460
That's why I have to fight!

776
01:04:08,052 --> 01:04:12,682
Inari...has grown into
a fine man.

777
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:19,313
Will you just let Inari go
there by himself?

778
01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:24,043
Open up!

779
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:24,777
Hey!

780
01:04:26,386 --> 01:04:28,638
I'm asking you to fight with me!

781
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:32,159
Old man! Please listen to me!

782
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:43,504
I went all over the town,
but no one wants to come.

783
01:04:44,143 --> 01:04:45,144
I have no choice!

784
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:59,854
Wait!
You're just a child!

785
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:06,485
I may be a child, but I already
know what it means to fight.

786
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:10,031
Because I'm my father's son!

787
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:14,827
Wait a moment, Inari!

788
01:05:20,374 --> 01:05:22,084
Where did he go...?

789
01:05:24,211 --> 01:05:28,132
I didn't see him,
but the fog is starting to lift...

790
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:31,290
Huh? Is he over there?

791
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:42,939
What the heck is going on here?!

792
01:05:49,467 --> 01:05:51,595
Isn't that the masked boy?

793
01:05:54,408 --> 01:05:57,745
<i>The boy...is already dead.</i>

794
01:06:02,049 --> 01:06:03,425
You did great, Haku.

795
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:10,925
Kakashi Sensei!

796
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:14,553
<i>He intends to cut right through
the boy to get me!</i>

797
01:06:15,888 --> 01:06:19,308
I really did find a treasure back then!

798
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:21,519
Even in his final moment,

799
01:06:21,544 --> 01:06:24,130
he gave me such
a perfect opportunity!

800
01:06:35,282 --> 01:06:37,535
You were able to move
cause Haku was already dead, huh?

801
01:06:38,285 --> 01:06:39,412
I won't forgive you!

802
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:40,413
Naruto!

803
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:41,872
You just stay there and watch!

804
01:07:00,199 --> 01:07:01,408
This is...

805
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,145
my battle!

806
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:08,107
Naruto!
It's good to see you!

807
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:10,818
<i>Sakura...</i>

808
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:13,487
Where's Sasuke?

809
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:20,453
Naruto!
Where is Sasuke?

810
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:31,130
Kakashi!

811
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:33,382
Don't get distracted now!

812
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:39,597
Why don't I go with you?

813
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:44,101
That way, you won't be going
against your orders.

814
01:07:45,336 --> 01:07:46,129
Right...

815
01:07:56,514 --> 01:07:57,598
Sasuke...

816
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:05,815
Huh?!

817
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:27,955
He's cold.

818
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:31,482
This isn't genjutsu, is it?

819
01:08:33,927 --> 01:08:36,930
Don't mind me.

820
01:08:37,738 --> 01:08:41,200
There are times when it's
alright to let out your emotions.

821
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:56,215
I always got perfect scores
at the ninja academy...

822
01:08:58,050 --> 01:08:58,843
Huh?

823
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:03,944
I memorized all the
hundreds of shinobi rules.

824
01:09:04,765 --> 01:09:07,768
All the tests were a breeze.

825
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:11,939
Until one day,
this question came up...

826
01:09:14,287 --> 01:09:18,125
State Rule #25 of
the Ways of the Shinobi...

827
01:09:19,446 --> 01:09:23,659
As always, I simply wrote down
the answer without batting an eye.

828
01:09:30,158 --> 01:09:33,395
"A Shinobi must never
show their true feelings

829
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:35,528
under any circumstances,
no matter what...

830
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:38,090
The mission always comes first.

831
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:42,469
A ninja must have the strength
of character never to shed any tears..."

832
01:09:51,312 --> 01:09:54,857
<i>Is this...
what it's like to be a Shinobi?</i>

833
01:09:56,794 --> 01:09:58,462
<i>How unbearably painful...</i>

834
01:10:00,371 --> 01:10:01,247
Sasuke...

835
01:10:27,254 --> 01:10:30,882
<i>Why...?
Why can't I keep up?</i>

836
01:10:34,021 --> 01:10:35,522
Damn you!

837
01:10:51,872 --> 01:10:52,873
Why you...!

838
01:11:03,842 --> 01:11:06,553
You can't possibly defeat me
the way you are now.

839
01:11:06,994 --> 01:11:08,120
What was that?

840
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:13,686
You still don't know...
What true strength means!

841
01:11:19,365 --> 01:11:21,784
Goodbye, Demon!

842
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:41,005
Both your arms have
now been disabled.

843
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:44,008
You can't even weave a hand sign.

844
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:48,429
Huh?

845
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:55,060
Oh!
You really got beat good this time.

846
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:59,648
You disappoint me, Zabuza.

847
01:12:04,903 --> 01:12:08,657
Gatô, why did you come here?

848
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:12,995
And who are those henchmen?

849
01:12:14,696 --> 01:12:17,115
Our plan has changed
a little...

850
01:12:19,212 --> 01:12:20,865
I'm sorry about this Zabuza,

851
01:12:20,890 --> 01:12:23,557
but you will die here.

852
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:26,383
What?!

853
01:12:27,092 --> 01:12:30,241
Since hiring a regular shinobi
costs a lot of money,

854
01:12:30,714 --> 01:12:33,629
I hired rouge ninja like you.

855
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:35,659
And, it would have been even
more ideal

856
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:38,329
to save my money and effort if
ninja-to-ninja battles

857
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:40,272
ended in each killing the other off.

858
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:43,042
Well, you are certainly not worthy
of being called

859
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:44,501
the Demon of the
Hidden Mist Village.

860
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:49,865
If you were to ask me,
you're just a cute little demon!

861
01:12:52,242 --> 01:12:53,952
<i>Who are those guys?</i>

862
01:12:54,196 --> 01:12:55,405
<i>So many of them...</i>

863
01:12:56,705 --> 01:12:58,749
Kakashi...I apologize.

864
01:12:59,449 --> 01:13:01,076
Our fight ends here...

865
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:04,922
I no longer have a reason
to assassinate Tazuna...

866
01:13:05,287 --> 01:13:08,039
so there is no reason
for us to continue.

867
01:13:09,332 --> 01:13:11,501
Yeah...you're right.

868
01:13:16,695 --> 01:13:18,029
That reminds me...

869
01:13:18,552 --> 01:13:20,971
I owe him something.

870
01:13:21,529 --> 01:13:25,950
He squeezed my arm 'til it broke...

871
01:13:30,444 --> 01:13:32,748
Huh, he's dead.

872
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:34,410
You bastard!

873
01:13:34,635 --> 01:13:36,637
What do you think you're doing, hey?!

874
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:39,248
Stop! Don't act so recklessly...!

875
01:13:39,475 --> 01:13:43,103
Why don't you do something too?!
He was your comrade, right?

876
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:47,423
Shut up, punk.
Haku is dead.

877
01:13:47,528 --> 01:13:48,237
What...?

878
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:51,468
Don't you feel anything watching
him disgrace Haku like that!

879
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,555
Weren't you with Haku for a long time!

880
01:13:55,139 --> 01:14:01,478
As Gato used me...
I was simply using Haku.

881
01:14:03,147 --> 01:14:04,565
I thought I'd told you...

882
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:07,901
We shinobi are merely tools.

883
01:14:09,010 --> 01:14:13,723
What I wanted were his skills,
not Haku himself.

884
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:17,448
I have no regrets...

885
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:22,708
Do you...
Do you really mean that?

886
01:14:23,375 --> 01:14:24,418
Naruto, stop.

887
01:14:25,002 --> 01:14:28,046
There's no need to fight
him anymore...Besides...

888
01:14:28,755 --> 01:14:32,259
Shut up!
He's still my enemy!

889
01:14:36,514 --> 01:14:37,891
He...

890
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:41,750
He really liked you!

891
01:14:42,603 --> 01:14:45,564
<i>Do you have somebody
precious in your life?</i>

892
01:14:45,977 --> 01:14:48,354
He was devoted to you!

893
01:14:48,517 --> 01:14:53,439
<i>When a person has something
precious they want to protect...</i>

894
01:14:54,019 --> 01:14:56,771
<i>that's when they can truly
become strong.</i>

895
01:14:57,114 --> 01:15:00,617
But you think he was nothing?
Don't you feel anything?!

896
01:15:01,141 --> 01:15:05,103
<i>It's difficult for me to completely
become a shinobi.</i>

897
01:15:05,709 --> 01:15:08,420
You really...honestly...

898
01:15:08,545 --> 01:15:10,797
don't feel anything at all?

899
01:15:12,582 --> 01:15:14,655
<i>I'd like to make that person's
dream come true...</i>

900
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:17,891
<i>For that, I could completely
become a shinobi.</i>

901
01:15:19,139 --> 01:15:21,600
Is that really how you get...

902
01:15:21,812 --> 01:15:24,106
when you become as strong as you are?

903
01:15:25,562 --> 01:15:30,734
He threw his life away for you!

904
01:15:31,606 --> 01:15:34,025
<i>I'd like to make that
person's dream come true...</i>

905
01:15:34,726 --> 01:15:37,228
<i>That is my dream.</i>

906
01:15:39,316 --> 01:15:41,443
He died without any of
his dreams coming true.

907
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:44,248
<i>I was happy.</i>

908
01:15:45,582 --> 01:15:47,584
To die as a tool...!

909
01:15:49,586 --> 01:15:55,092
That's...
That's...too cruel...

910
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:02,558
Kid...

911
01:16:17,890 --> 01:16:22,102
Don't say another word...

912
01:16:27,786 --> 01:16:28,787
Haku wasn't...

913
01:16:29,406 --> 01:16:31,450
He wasn't just thinking of me.

914
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:34,106
He was feeling pain inside

915
01:16:34,131 --> 01:16:35,924
while he battled you guys too...

916
01:16:37,509 --> 01:16:41,471
I know.
He was too kind...

917
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:47,327
I'm glad our last battle
was with you, boy.

918
01:16:49,650 --> 01:16:50,526
Huh?

919
01:16:54,727 --> 01:16:59,149
Yes, little punk,
it's as you say, after all...

920
01:17:00,744 --> 01:17:02,412
Shinobi are human too...

921
01:17:03,637 --> 01:17:07,224
Maybe it's impossible to become
an emotionless tool...

922
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:12,336
I've lost.

923
01:17:16,087 --> 01:17:17,963
Kid! Give me your kunai knife!

924
01:17:24,681 --> 01:17:25,515
Okay...

925
01:17:36,443 --> 01:17:37,194
What?!

926
01:17:37,772 --> 01:17:40,650
Enough! What are you waiting for?
Kill them all!

927
01:17:40,822 --> 01:17:42,199
Right!

928
01:17:43,424 --> 01:17:44,676
Are you crazy?

929
01:17:44,701 --> 01:17:46,995
Do you think you can win by yourself
against this many of us?

930
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:22,280
Demon!

931
01:18:39,089 --> 01:18:43,719
If you're so anxious
to join your friend...

932
01:18:44,044 --> 01:18:47,380
Then go...alone!

933
01:18:47,738 --> 01:18:49,532
Unfortunately...

934
01:18:49,793 --> 01:18:55,807
I don't...intend on going...
to the same place...as Haku!

935
01:18:56,273 --> 01:18:59,818
W-What?! Pretending to be so tough...

936
01:19:00,594 --> 01:19:06,016
You're going to hell with me!

937
01:19:07,524 --> 01:19:09,359
It's no big deal...

938
01:19:09,808 --> 01:19:12,224
When the Demon of
the Hidden Mist Village

939
01:19:12,249 --> 01:19:16,169
dies and goes to hell,
he can become a real demon!

940
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:19,130
Look forward to it!

941
01:19:19,283 --> 01:19:21,411
I'll let you find out
for yourself

942
01:19:21,594 --> 01:19:24,972
if I'm a cute little demon
or not in hell!

943
01:20:13,683 --> 01:20:15,018
Haku...

944
01:20:25,111 --> 01:20:29,908
Now...it's goodbye, Haku...

945
01:20:31,785 --> 01:20:34,496
Thanks for everything...

946
01:20:35,539 --> 01:20:37,207
I'm sorry...

947
01:20:49,374 --> 01:20:51,000
Don't look away.

948
01:20:52,430 --> 01:20:55,392
This is the end of
a man who lived fiercely.

949
01:20:56,980 --> 01:20:57,779
Yeah...

950
01:21:02,004 --> 01:21:04,507
<i>Did I...die...?</i>

951
01:21:05,902 --> 01:21:06,862
Sasuke!

952
01:21:06,941 --> 01:21:08,485
<i>Sakura...</i>

953
01:21:10,026 --> 01:21:13,029
<i>Am I...am I...?!</i>

954
01:21:16,246 --> 01:21:18,456
Sakura, you're heavy.

955
01:21:18,691 --> 01:21:19,474
Huh?!

956
01:21:21,084 --> 01:21:22,752
Sasuke...

957
01:21:28,685 --> 01:21:32,664
Sasuke, Sasuke, Sasuke!

958
01:21:32,762 --> 01:21:34,699
Sakura...
That hurts...

959
01:21:36,641 --> 01:21:38,768
<i>Things turned out well,
didn't they, Sakura?</i>

960
01:21:40,390 --> 01:21:42,225
Stop, you shouldn't move!

961
01:21:42,606 --> 01:21:44,274
I'm fine. Where's Naruto?

962
01:21:44,846 --> 01:21:47,713
And what happened
to that masked guy?

963
01:21:48,439 --> 01:21:50,149
Naruto's fine.

964
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:54,451
And...the masked kid,
he died...

965
01:21:55,398 --> 01:21:58,067
Died? Did Naruto get him?

966
01:21:58,622 --> 01:22:04,085
Well...I'm not really sure,
but he protected Zabuza...

967
01:22:07,088 --> 01:22:08,965
I had faith in you.

968
01:22:09,424 --> 01:22:10,926
You are awesome, Sasuke!

969
01:22:10,967 --> 01:22:13,136
You avoided getting inflicted with
any mortal wounds!

970
01:22:15,010 --> 01:22:17,596
<i>From the beginning...
he never intended to...</i>

971
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:19,851
Naruto!

972
01:22:20,143 --> 01:22:21,186
<i>Sakura...</i>

973
01:22:21,211 --> 01:22:24,047
Sasuke's all right!
He's alive!

974
01:22:24,731 --> 01:22:25,690
Huh?

975
01:22:37,535 --> 01:22:42,499
<i>He was feeling pain inside
while he battled you guys too...</i>

976
01:22:43,124 --> 01:22:45,543
<i>He was too kind...</i>

977
01:22:46,843 --> 01:22:48,720
<i>I see...He...</i>

978
01:22:49,489 --> 01:22:51,783
So, Sasuke's all right too...

979
01:22:53,176 --> 01:22:54,344
That's a relief...

980
01:22:56,336 --> 01:22:57,796
Hey, hey, hey!

981
01:22:58,682 --> 01:23:00,183
Aren't you guys forgetting something!

982
01:23:00,738 --> 01:23:04,779
Damn ninja!
Killing our source of money!

983
01:23:05,447 --> 01:23:07,496
Now that it's come to this,

984
01:23:07,807 --> 01:23:11,813
there's no choice but to attack the
whole town and take everything valuable!

985
01:23:12,862 --> 01:23:13,947
Shoot, this isn't good!

986
01:23:14,030 --> 01:23:15,198
Kakashi Sensei!

987
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:18,034
Don't you have a jutsu
to annihilate them all at once?

988
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:20,704
That's impossible!
I've used too much chakra!

989
01:23:21,371 --> 01:23:22,539
Here we go!

990
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:34,926
Enemies who come any closer
to the island...

991
01:23:35,719 --> 01:23:37,762
With the might of
all the island's people...

992
01:23:37,945 --> 01:23:39,781
We will not allow you to live!

993
01:23:39,806 --> 01:23:41,057
Yeah!

994
01:23:41,307 --> 01:23:42,350
Inari!

995
01:23:43,893 --> 01:23:46,896
Heroes always arrive
on the scene late!

996
01:23:48,337 --> 01:23:51,215
Inari...You guys...

997
01:23:57,073 --> 01:23:59,868
Okay, I'm gonna help out, too!

998
01:24:00,326 --> 01:24:01,828
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

999
01:24:06,957 --> 01:24:09,757
I can't do much
with my current chakra...

1000
01:24:09,782 --> 01:24:11,284
but a bluff should be enough.

1001
01:24:12,255 --> 01:24:13,506
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

1002
01:24:15,573 --> 01:24:16,616
Kakashi Version!

1003
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:21,973
So...are you ready to fight?!

1004
01:24:22,348 --> 01:24:24,017
No, we're not!

1005
01:24:32,692 --> 01:24:33,860
We've done it!

1006
01:24:54,170 --> 01:24:56,005
Sounds like it's over.

1007
01:24:56,707 --> 01:24:57,500
Yeah...

1008
01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:01,971
Kakashi...
I'd like to ask you a favor.

1009
01:25:03,128 --> 01:25:04,045
What is it?

1010
01:25:05,725 --> 01:25:11,022
His face...
I want to see his face...

1011
01:25:15,485 --> 01:25:16,402
All right.

1012
01:25:41,302 --> 01:25:42,220
Huh?

1013
01:25:43,753 --> 01:25:44,587
Snow...

1014
01:25:45,227 --> 01:25:47,104
Snow at this time
of the year?

1015
01:25:56,526 --> 01:26:00,196
<i>Haku...
Are you crying?</i>

1016
01:26:09,315 --> 01:26:11,817
Thanks, Kakashi...

1017
01:26:20,596 --> 01:26:23,057
You were at my side from the start...

1018
01:26:24,378 --> 01:26:25,755
At the very least...

1019
01:26:26,232 --> 01:26:29,152
I can be at your side in the end.

1020
01:26:41,237 --> 01:26:43,281
If it's possible...

1021
01:26:44,909 --> 01:26:48,037
I'd like to go...

1022
01:26:50,079 --> 01:26:51,497
to the same place...

1023
01:26:55,501 --> 01:26:56,544
as you.

1024
01:27:17,623 --> 01:27:18,916
This guy...

1025
01:27:19,275 --> 01:27:23,655
He was born in a village
where it snowed a lot.

1026
01:27:25,907 --> 01:27:26,741
I see...

1027
01:27:28,117 --> 01:27:30,828
He was a boy as pure as snow...

1028
01:27:32,956 --> 01:27:34,874
You can go with him, Zabuza...

1029
01:27:38,419 --> 01:27:40,421
The two of you...together.

1030
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:46,511
But you know, Kakashi Sensei...

1031
01:27:47,011 --> 01:27:48,012
Hmm?

1032
01:27:48,469 --> 01:27:50,346
I wonder if the way a ninja
should be

1033
01:27:50,749 --> 01:27:53,209
is really as these
two were saying.

1034
01:27:55,395 --> 01:27:59,524
Shinobi should not seek
the reason for their own existence.

1035
01:28:00,984 --> 01:28:04,112
What's important is to
exist merely as tools.

1036
01:28:06,155 --> 01:28:08,157
That's the same in the Land of Leaves.

1037
01:28:10,092 --> 01:28:12,053
I wonder if that's what
it really means

1038
01:28:12,078 --> 01:28:14,205
to become a real ninja.

1039
01:28:14,998 --> 01:28:17,083
I guess...I guess!

1040
01:28:17,306 --> 01:28:19,016
I don't like that!

1041
01:28:20,086 --> 01:28:21,713
Do you think so, too?

1042
01:28:22,237 --> 01:28:23,530
Hmm...

1043
01:28:23,715 --> 01:28:27,725
Well...That's why all ninja live

1044
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:31,962
trying to figure that
out without realizing it...

1045
01:28:33,182 --> 01:28:36,394
Like Zabuza...and that kid...

1046
01:28:42,827 --> 01:28:43,702
Okay!

1047
01:28:43,943 --> 01:28:44,694
Huh?

1048
01:28:45,168 --> 01:28:46,795
I've just decided!

1049
01:28:47,075 --> 01:28:50,078
I'm going to pursue my
own Ninja Way!

1050
01:28:50,664 --> 01:28:53,417
I'm gonna sprint straight
ahead and pursue

1051
01:28:53,929 --> 01:28:56,829
a way that I absolutely
won't regret!

1052
01:29:09,135 --> 01:29:12,722
Thanks to you the bridge
was safely completed,

1053
01:29:13,114 --> 01:29:15,742
but we will miss you very much.

1054
01:29:15,926 --> 01:29:17,219
Take care.

1055
01:29:17,477 --> 01:29:18,853
Thank you for everything.

1056
01:29:19,328 --> 01:29:20,621
Now, now!

1057
01:29:20,646 --> 01:29:23,649
We'll come back for
a visit again, Tazuna!

1058
01:29:25,401 --> 01:29:26,569
For sure?

1059
01:29:26,736 --> 01:29:27,487
Huh?

1060
01:29:32,115 --> 01:29:35,993
Inari...you're gonna
miss us, aren't you?

1061
01:29:36,052 --> 01:29:38,721
It's all right to cry.
Go ahead and cry!

1062
01:29:39,082 --> 01:29:40,249
I won't cry!

1063
01:29:40,658 --> 01:29:43,750
It's all right if you cry, Naruto!

1064
01:29:43,901 --> 01:29:46,195
Oh, is that so?

1065
01:29:53,262 --> 01:29:54,097
See ya!

1066
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:55,098
Oh...!

1067
01:29:58,267 --> 01:30:00,103
<i>You are so stubborn.</i>

1068
01:30:04,774 --> 01:30:07,860
That boy changed Inari's heart...

1069
01:30:08,303 --> 01:30:11,389
and Inari changed the hearts
of all the people in the village.

1070
01:30:11,948 --> 01:30:15,718
That boy created a bridge
linking us to hope,

1071
01:30:15,743 --> 01:30:18,913
a bridge called courage.

1072
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,501
So a linking bridge...

1073
01:30:22,387 --> 01:30:23,466
Speaking of bridges,

1074
01:30:23,491 --> 01:30:25,452
we need to name
this bridge, don't we?

1075
01:30:25,753 --> 01:30:26,963
That's true.

1076
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:28,256
In that case,

1077
01:30:28,281 --> 01:30:31,910
I have a perfect name
for this bridge.

1078
01:30:32,218 --> 01:30:33,970
Yeah, what is it?

1079
01:30:34,916 --> 01:30:37,619
The Great Naruto Bridge.
How's that?

1080
01:30:39,394 --> 01:30:40,395
That's a good name.

1081
01:30:41,185 --> 01:30:44,532
Alright! Let's get back soon
so I can have Iruka Sensei treat me

1082
01:30:44,557 --> 01:30:47,492
to ramen to celebrate
us completing the mission!

1083
01:30:47,984 --> 01:30:52,822
And! And! I'll tell Konohamaru
tales of my heroic exploits!

1084
01:30:53,316 --> 01:30:54,942
Then I...

1085
01:30:55,810 --> 01:30:57,848
Hey! Sasuke, do you want to go
on a date

1086
01:30:57,873 --> 01:30:59,115
when we get back to the village?

1087
01:30:59,459 --> 01:31:00,835
No, I don't think so.

1088
01:31:01,315 --> 01:31:02,858
<i>Just like that...</i>

1089
01:31:03,332 --> 01:31:06,294
You know! You know!
I'll go with you!

1090
01:31:06,461 --> 01:31:07,344
Be quiet!

1091
01:31:07,369 --> 01:31:08,329
Shut up! Naruto!

1092
01:31:12,884 --> 01:31:14,552
Haku said to me...

1093
01:31:15,112 --> 01:31:19,241
When a person has something
precious they want to protect,

1094
01:31:19,266 --> 01:31:21,102
they can become truly strong.

1095
01:31:23,895 --> 01:31:27,440
I see...
So do you feel the same way?

1096
01:31:28,316 --> 01:31:28,900
Yeah!

1097
01:31:29,341 --> 01:31:32,469
After watching Haku and Zabuza,
I think I believe that.

1098
01:31:33,112 --> 01:31:35,031
Hey, hey...

1099
01:31:35,072 --> 01:31:38,326
Kakashi Sensei,
what do you think about them?

1100
01:31:39,889 --> 01:31:43,100
What? Are you sure
that name's okay?

1101
01:31:45,161 --> 01:31:50,208
This name will ensure that
this bridge will never collapse...

1102
01:31:50,254 --> 01:31:54,800
And someday, it'll be the name
of a very famous bridge...

1103
01:31:55,059 --> 01:31:58,062
A name heard around the world.

1104
01:32:00,765 --> 01:32:03,601
That's truly what I hope.
