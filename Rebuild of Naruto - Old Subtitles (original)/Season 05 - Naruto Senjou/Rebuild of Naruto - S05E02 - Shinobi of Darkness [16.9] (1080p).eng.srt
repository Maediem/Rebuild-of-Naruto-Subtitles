1
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,391
<i>If only Lady Tsunade would
come out of her coma,</i>

2
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,978
<i>I know she would resolve
the situation with Sasuke.</i>

3
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,022
Excuse me.

4
00:00:24,883 --> 00:00:25,717
Sai?

5
00:00:26,476 --> 00:00:28,520
I need to speak to you.

6
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,655
Naruto did what?!

7
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,157
Yes.

8
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,909
In order to protect Sasuke.

9
00:00:36,225 --> 00:00:37,726
He was bruised and battered all over.

10
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:47,422
Still, he refused to sell out Sasuke.

11
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,382
Not only that...

12
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,426
In order to prevent you from worrying,

13
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:53,666
he asked me to keep it quiet.

14
00:00:54,807 --> 00:00:57,059
He's on his way to see the Raikage

15
00:00:57,084 --> 00:00:59,378
and ask him to forgive Sasuke.

16
00:00:59,515 --> 00:01:01,851
Why would he be so reckless?!

17
00:01:02,428 --> 00:01:04,138
Wasn't Kakashi with him?!

18
00:01:05,894 --> 00:01:07,688
It probably wouldn't have
made any difference.

19
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,699
Kakashi Sensei has faith in Naruto.

20
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,947
Even if it's a long shot,

21
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,949
he probably wants to create
an opportunity for him.

22
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:22,040
<i>If Lady Tsunade were there,
she'd have done the same thing.</i>

23
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,292
Sakura...

24
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:30,507
I was only recently assigned to
Team Kakashi to take Sasuke's place.

25
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,052
So I still don't know
all of you that well.

26
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,722
And I'm not good at understanding
a person's feelings.

27
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,225
But...

28
00:01:41,179 --> 00:01:45,516
Even I can tell that
Naruto loves you!

29
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,945
<i>I swear I'll bring Sasuke back!</i>

30
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:54,903
<i>I promise that on my life!</i>

31
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:02,247
<i>Sakura! I'll keep my promise to you.</i>

32
00:02:03,266 --> 00:02:07,645
<i>I swear I'll keep it because I said so.</i>

33
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,006
<i>I said so...</i>

34
00:02:16,128 --> 00:02:17,129
Sakura...

35
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:24,050
It's as though Naruto has been shouldering
the burden of his promise to you.

36
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,686
As though he intends to bear
that burden for the rest of his life.

37
00:02:29,435 --> 00:02:31,479
I don't know what you told Naruto.

38
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:37,240
But it's no different from
what was done to me.

39
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,576
It's like a Curse Mark.

40
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,317
Sasuke is the source of
Naruto's agony.

41
00:02:46,407 --> 00:02:47,909
But aren't you a part of it too?

42
00:02:52,997 --> 00:02:53,998
Ino...

43
00:02:58,231 --> 00:02:59,440
Don't cry, Ino!

44
00:02:59,752 --> 00:03:01,545
Kiba, don't be so harsh.

45
00:03:02,762 --> 00:03:05,306
You know how Ino has felt
about Sasuke all these...

46
00:03:05,487 --> 00:03:06,696
It can't be helped!

47
00:03:09,485 --> 00:03:11,278
Things have changed since then.

48
00:03:14,488 --> 00:03:15,572
Will they be okay?

49
00:03:16,477 --> 00:03:17,561
Look at Ino.

50
00:03:18,468 --> 00:03:19,737
How will Naruto and Sakura take it?

51
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,077
Let's leave it to Shikamaru.

52
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:25,278
He'll find the right words.

53
00:03:26,313 --> 00:03:30,401
Plus, there was that first mission of his
as a squad leader that failed,

54
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:33,416
and he still feels somewhat
responsible for it.

55
00:03:35,538 --> 00:03:39,417
If only we had been able to take
Sasuke back that time.

56
00:03:41,505 --> 00:03:44,591
That's why he volunteered
to be the persuader.

57
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:51,962
Wait! Naruto genuinely wants
to rescue Sasuke,

58
00:03:52,368 --> 00:03:56,238
not just because he promised
Sakura! Isn't that so?

59
00:03:56,787 --> 00:03:59,332
I totally agree with you.

60
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:03,177
But...both Sakura and I...

61
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:05,371
and everyone else rely on
Naruto too much.

62
00:04:06,356 --> 00:04:08,608
I've watched how Naruto
has been acting lately

63
00:04:08,633 --> 00:04:10,593
and I figured out what he's feeling.

64
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,171
It's sadness.

65
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:22,470
Then my thoughts turn to Sasuke...
and it starts to get warm inside my gut.

66
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,349
I realize now that it's anger.

67
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,941
Whether it's for Naruto's sake
or for the village,

68
00:04:35,601 --> 00:04:37,353
we can't just rely on Naruto.

69
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,904
We have to take action ourselves.

70
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:41,814
Sasuke is...

71
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,408
Sai is absolutely right.

72
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,703
Shikamaru...

73
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,920
We're not kids anymore.

74
00:04:50,997 --> 00:04:53,082
We must stop the Akatsuki.

75
00:04:53,367 --> 00:04:56,787
And we must stop Sasuke.

76
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:03,052
I came here for Team 7's consent.

77
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,471
Consent? Don't tell me...

78
00:05:06,135 --> 00:05:08,513
Yes...exactly that.

79
00:05:08,984 --> 00:05:11,612
We can't allow war to break out
between the Hidden Leaf

80
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,022
and the Hidden Cloud
because of Sasuke.

81
00:05:14,775 --> 00:05:17,241
According to the messenger
from the Cloud,

82
00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:21,145
Sasuke is already being treated
as a criminal on a national level.

83
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:25,408
If Sasuke continues to align himself
with the Akatsuki

84
00:05:25,697 --> 00:05:28,491
and intensify the hatred throughout
the country,

85
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:32,540
the Hidden Leaf must deal
with Sasuke.

86
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,791
That is my belief.

87
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,879
You understand where
I'm coming from, don't you?

88
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:40,882
Sakura...

89
00:05:46,549 --> 00:05:47,925
That's why I need your consent.

90
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,615
Sakura, will you...

91
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,641
Shikamaru!

92
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,772
Please don't...

93
00:05:58,411 --> 00:05:59,787
say anything more.

94
00:06:01,085 --> 00:06:05,006
Sorry, Sakura...
But whatever your answer is,

95
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:08,818
I must act for the sake of
the Leaf's future.

96
00:06:09,775 --> 00:06:11,819
I intend to tell Naruto this too.

97
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:13,152
Where is he?

98
00:06:14,863 --> 00:06:17,491
Naruto has gone to the Land of Iron.

99
00:06:18,695 --> 00:06:19,947
To meet with the Raikage.

100
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:22,533
He's willing to go that far?

101
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,845
I guess this isn't gonna be easy.

102
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,710
I'll talk to Naruto.

103
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,352
Sakura!

104
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,863
He's foolish enough to like
someone like me.

105
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:51,253
So let me handle this.

106
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,693
Well then, what do we do now?

107
00:08:36,164 --> 00:08:38,332
We have to form
an Allied Shinobi Force.

108
00:08:38,573 --> 00:08:41,701
It's the only way we can counter
the power of the seven Tailed Beasts.

109
00:08:42,957 --> 00:08:45,209
You were opposed to this,
weren't you, Lord Raikage?

110
00:08:45,554 --> 00:08:47,889
It seems my younger brother is alive.

111
00:08:48,302 --> 00:08:52,222
We cannot allow ourselves to be
manipulated by the Akatsuki any longer.

112
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,951
Form the alliance and
settle this once and for all!

113
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,955
What about the Hidden Leaf?
The Hokage ran off.

114
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,457
There is too much suspicion
surrounding Danzo.

115
00:09:01,777 --> 00:09:05,322
He lost our trust at this summit.

116
00:09:05,814 --> 00:09:08,108
When the Hidden Leaf ninja
learn about him,

117
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:10,885
his position in the village will
become insecure.

118
00:09:11,179 --> 00:09:12,764
He will be removed in no time!

119
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:16,055
I will speak to someone I trust among
the Hidden Leaf

120
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,831
regarding the Allied Shinobi Force.

121
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,267
Who would that be?

122
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,519
Kakashi Hatake of the Sharingan.

123
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,439
You mean the White Fang's son?

124
00:09:26,012 --> 00:09:29,974
Fine. He seems more trustworthy
than Danzo.

125
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,321
Agreed.

126
00:09:33,429 --> 00:09:37,058
Lord Raikage, we must take measures
to find Killer Bee immediately!

127
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,574
If the Akatsuki want
the Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails,

128
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:43,333
they are probably still pursuing Bee.

129
00:09:43,992 --> 00:09:47,245
Yes. Shee, send word to
the village to put together

130
00:09:47,507 --> 00:09:50,385
a Tracking Unit to begin the search
for Bee immediately!

131
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:51,465
Yes sir!

132
00:09:52,252 --> 00:09:55,046
We must notify Samui's team too.

133
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,946
Omoi and Karui have been
feeling quite distraught.

134
00:09:58,403 --> 00:10:01,489
If we are to stop
Madara's Project Tsuki no Me,

135
00:10:01,744 --> 00:10:04,705
we cannot let the Eight-Tails and
Nine-Tails fall into his hands.

136
00:10:04,957 --> 00:10:09,233
I think it is imperative that our
Allied Shinobi Forces find the two first

137
00:10:09,395 --> 00:10:12,273
and place them into hiding.

138
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,131
Y-You're absolutely right!

139
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:16,825
If the day comes when
this Ten-Tails is revived…

140
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:20,453
However, we cannot even imagine
the power Madara wields

141
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,747
with the seven Tailed Beasts
he already has.

142
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,666
Furthermore, he may possess
certain jutsu or a trump card

143
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,067
for using the Tailed Beasts.

144
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,880
Otherwise, he wouldn't have
come on so strong.

145
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:35,301
Perhaps it would be wise for
the Allied shinobi Forces to plan

146
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:39,263
on using the Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails
as military weapons too.

147
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,641
That cannot happen.

148
00:10:42,492 --> 00:10:45,244
This is also a war to protect those two.

149
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,872
There is a reason why Madara
is waging war

150
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,107
with just the seven Tailed Beasts
he has collected thus far.

151
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:52,991
It is too difficult for Madara,
in his weakened state,

152
00:10:53,016 --> 00:10:57,521
and the Akatsuki members to capture
the Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails.

153
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:01,086
And even if they had succeeded,
he felt the risk was too great.

154
00:11:01,422 --> 00:11:05,175
That is why he may be hoping to
lure the two to his side through war.

155
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:08,976
In any case, using the Eight-Tails
and Nine-Tails for battle

156
00:11:09,226 --> 00:11:11,020
is not a wise strategy.

157
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,214
I agree.

158
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,342
I also concur with the Kazekage.

159
00:11:16,685 --> 00:11:18,527
If we consider
the worst-case scenario,

160
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:21,931
it will be like offering the Eight-Tails
or Nine-Tails on a silver platter!

161
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,609
And besides, the Eight-Tails is
my younger brother and

162
00:11:25,634 --> 00:11:28,403
"military strategy" is
a foreign concept to him.

163
00:11:29,775 --> 00:11:32,068
I can't predict what he'd do.

164
00:11:32,467 --> 00:11:35,720
He may just create more chaos
on the battlefield!

165
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,823
Naruto the Nine-Tails,
would do the same.

166
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,468
– That's for sure.
– I'll say.

167
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:45,627
I understand.
Well then, Lord Tsuchikage,

168
00:11:45,652 --> 00:11:48,695
our aim will be to protect and
confine the Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails.

169
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,406
Fine.

170
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:51,923
Intel about Killer Bee
will be provided to

171
00:11:51,948 --> 00:11:54,075
the Stone, Mist, Sand and Leaf Villages.

172
00:11:54,522 --> 00:11:57,364
Use it to form Tracking Units
and get moving!

173
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:01,195
Send word the instant
you find the Eight-Tails.

174
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,328
My younger brother will
only heed orders from me!

175
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:08,352
By the way, Kazekage, we will leave
the matter with Kakashi to you.

176
00:12:08,668 --> 00:12:09,404
Yes.

177
00:12:10,071 --> 00:12:11,531
On my way here,

178
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:14,684
I met Kakashi Hatake and
the boy who is the Nine-Tails' Jinchuriki.

179
00:12:15,856 --> 00:12:17,858
They might still be here
in the Land of Iron.

180
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,316
You should start your search
for them here.

181
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:21,699
Understood.

182
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,618
U-Um...May I say something?

183
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,703
What is it?

184
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,586
Uh...Yes...Umm…

185
00:12:28,716 --> 00:12:30,343
Spit it out!

186
00:12:30,928 --> 00:12:34,812
I-In the Akatsuki, there's someone who,
like me, is a member of

187
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,923
the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist.
Kisame Hoshigaki.

188
00:12:38,302 --> 00:12:41,300
He has chakra equal to that
of a Jinchuriki

189
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:43,889
as well as a sword known
as Samehada, Shark Skin,

190
00:12:43,914 --> 00:12:46,187
which is the most evil, even among
the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist.

191
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:49,017
When his chakra and sword merge,
even though he is human,

192
00:12:49,042 --> 00:12:51,228
he releases power close to
that of a Jinchuriki.

193
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:53,439
He is like a Tailed Beast
without the tail.

194
00:12:53,534 --> 00:12:55,911
That's what I've been told by my seniors.

195
00:12:56,312 --> 00:12:59,941
He is extraordinary and
must not be underestimated.

196
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,281
We already know that!

197
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:05,159
But are you all sure about this plan?

198
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,861
We do not know what kind of power

199
00:13:07,886 --> 00:13:10,054
the seven Tailed Beasts possess
under Madara.

200
00:13:10,338 --> 00:13:12,799
If we confine the Eight-Tails
and Nine-Tails,

201
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:16,771
and our Allied Shinobi Force is destroyed
while protecting these Tailed Beasts,

202
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:20,677
our entire effort would
have been meaningless.

203
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:25,170
If that is the case, I think it is better
to use the two right from the beginning

204
00:13:25,195 --> 00:13:28,837
in a combined effort with
the Allied Shinobi Forces.

205
00:13:29,656 --> 00:13:31,282
I wonder about that.

206
00:13:32,267 --> 00:13:36,814
At this moment, the world's first
Allied Shinobi Force is being formed.

207
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,235
Its power is also unknown.

208
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,599
Madara will also be taking a great risk

209
00:13:42,624 --> 00:13:45,085
in pitting the power of
the seven Tailed Beasts against it.

210
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:49,495
Otherwise, why would he have come
to this summit to try to negotiate?

211
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,307
He must also be dealing with
unfavorable conditions.

212
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,836
Furthermore, we Samurai
will also participate in this war!

213
00:13:57,387 --> 00:14:01,391
Lord Tsuchikage…
Do you still have doubts even now?

214
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:05,845
After what we learned about Danzo,
who was your initial choice?

215
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:11,475
The question of who will lead the
Allied Shinobi Forces is still an issue.

216
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,603
Is there any among the current Kage
you consider competent enough?

217
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:19,441
Mifune, you criticized every Kage
including me.

218
00:14:34,851 --> 00:14:38,354
I believe appointing Lord Ei
would be the wisest move.

219
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,202
Didn't you say that Ei
was unsuitable

220
00:14:40,227 --> 00:14:43,063
because he gives in to his emotions
and relies on power?

221
00:14:43,776 --> 00:14:46,737
There is no longer any doubt
that the Eight-Tails is alive.

222
00:14:47,472 --> 00:14:51,059
Furthermore, he skillfully built
a consensus earlier

223
00:14:51,282 --> 00:14:53,534
and was quick to come up with
a counter strategy.

224
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:57,938
And Lord Ei is the only one capable
of controlling the Eight-Tails,

225
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,100
which is key to this battle.

226
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:04,737
Mizukage, Kazekage…
Are you in agreement?

227
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,115
This is not the time to argue.

228
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,701
I trust Lord Raikage.

229
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,037
We'll leave it to you, Raikage.

230
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:16,790
Understood. I will lead the Allied Forces.

231
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,336
Ohnoki the Fence Sitter,

232
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,381
since you are the only one
who has battled Madara Uchiha,

233
00:15:23,406 --> 00:15:25,492
we'll need any intel you can give us.

234
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,134
I expect your cooperation.

235
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:31,764
He certainly enjoys barking orders
at everyone.

236
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,433
If you don't trust me, fine.

237
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,441
But if we don't do something,

238
00:15:36,466 --> 00:15:38,819
the ninja world as we know it
will disappear.

239
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:43,192
Now is the time to put
personal differences aside and cooperate!

240
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,737
Well, it's certainly better than
losing this war.

241
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:51,630
Our arguments are nothing compared
to a world without ninja.

242
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,994
So I shall cooperate.

243
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,973
The Allied Shinobi Forces
are hereby formed.

244
00:16:14,552 --> 00:16:17,722
First, we must notify the Feudal Lords.

245
00:16:25,836 --> 00:16:28,589
Looks like the Raikage and
Kazekage went upstairs.

246
00:16:29,497 --> 00:16:32,374
Sasuke and Karin must
have gone ahead.

247
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:34,688
We should go up too.

248
00:16:35,135 --> 00:16:37,429
But it's guarded.

249
00:16:37,877 --> 00:16:39,003
We'll be spotted right away.

250
00:16:39,314 --> 00:16:42,191
Well, I have a good way.

251
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,337
What the hell was he?

252
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,214
So gross!

253
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:52,928
Shinobi...We shinobi we endure…

254
00:16:52,953 --> 00:16:56,415
Shinobi suppressing our sobs!

255
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:00,853
You don't just sing enka.
Enka requires a passion-filled soul!

256
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,230
Now you try singing.

257
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:04,440
Yeah!

258
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:09,319
Shinobi, by being so stealthy…

259
00:17:09,474 --> 00:17:12,686
We extend our life expectancy.

260
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:26,086
You lack passion.

261
00:17:26,868 --> 00:17:27,953
Passion!

262
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:34,167
You're just mouthing the lyrics
and not taking it seriously!

263
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,387
Passion?

264
00:17:35,497 --> 00:17:36,957
That's right! Passion!

265
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,683
As the characters in “enka” imply,

266
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:43,353
it's important to act out the world
in the song with passion!

267
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:47,983
Also, the tremolo,
you have to clench your belly

268
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,652
and bring the note into your nose,
all right?

269
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,323
What's the matter, Ponta?

270
00:18:00,609 --> 00:18:03,320
He's one of the Akatsuki, Master Kin.

271
00:18:04,154 --> 00:18:06,448
This personal biz will take a second,

272
00:18:06,473 --> 00:18:09,935
what a miff,
but no worries I'll erase him in a jiff!

273
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:13,008
I searched high and low for you,
Eight-Tails.

274
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:17,596
My great blade Samehada
loves powerful chakra.

275
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:22,684
And it seems to have finally caught scent
of some delicious chakra.

276
00:18:24,661 --> 00:18:29,124
I'm sorry, but you're going to
be food for my Samehada.

277
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,402
Not to worry though, I won't kill you.

278
00:18:36,069 --> 00:18:37,654
But I'll kill you.

279
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,993
I'll show you that
we're worlds apart in power.

280
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,955
So prepare ya-self, fool, ya fool!

281
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:43,997
My rhymes are…

282
00:18:44,576 --> 00:18:45,202
Ponta!

283
00:18:45,495 --> 00:18:48,915
You sure are chatty for a Jinchuriki.

284
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:52,256
There's a peculiar bear upstaging you!

285
00:19:00,555 --> 00:19:04,121
<i>If we keep doing what we've
always done, we'll never find Sasuke.</i>

286
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,062
<i>I've got to use Sage Mode.</i>

287
00:19:07,602 --> 00:19:10,146
<i>But first, I need to be able
to sustain it longer.</i>

288
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,986
Naruto, come inside soon.

289
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,450
Finally found you!

290
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:24,492
Sakura…

291
00:19:24,936 --> 00:19:27,480
Sai, Kiba, and even Bushy Brows?

292
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,544
Why did you all come here?

293
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,713
Naruto…

294
00:19:34,872 --> 00:19:36,541
I need to talk to you.

295
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:48,145
W-What did you just say, Sakura?

296
00:19:48,843 --> 00:19:51,888
I think I heard wrong.
Could you say it again?

297
00:19:54,467 --> 00:19:55,843
I said…

298
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,280
I…

299
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,376
Love you, Naruto.

300
00:20:04,202 --> 00:20:07,831
I said Sasuke doesn't mean
anything to me anymore.

301
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:11,043
I must have been crazy to carry
a torch for him for so long.

302
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,780
Listen carefully when
someone confesses her feelings for you!

303
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,514
But why? What for?!

304
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:29,520
This isn't the place to be joking around.
It's not funny, Sakura.

305
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,981
What's going on?

306
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,731
Nothing really!

307
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,569
I just woke up.

308
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:41,823
Why should I love a rogue ninja
who's a criminal?

309
00:20:42,703 --> 00:20:46,790
I'm not a child anymore.
I can face reality.

310
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:51,291
So Naruto, you can forget about
that promise you made to me.

311
00:20:52,258 --> 00:20:55,678
You can stop chasing
after Sasuke, all right?

312
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,589
What's going on?

313
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:06,890
Do you think Naruto will calmly
accept our decision?

314
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:10,060
But this is something we all decided.

315
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,104
We have to make him understand.

316
00:21:12,842 --> 00:21:15,470
I'll talk to Naruto about everything.

317
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:16,817
You, Sakura?

318
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,069
Do you have a plan that'll work?

319
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,930
Just leave everything to me.

320
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,618
So don't say anything to Naruto.

321
00:21:27,101 --> 00:21:30,438
Please promise me this, everyone.

322
00:21:33,573 --> 00:21:34,574
And…

323
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,466
<i>Damn it…
Is this what she had in mind?</i>

324
00:21:42,699 --> 00:21:44,868
Sakura, did something happen?

325
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,639
This is all so sudden.

326
00:21:47,664 --> 00:21:49,457
Nothing happened!

327
00:21:49,783 --> 00:21:52,160
It's obvious why I fell in love with you.

328
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:03,561
<i>All I really want, is for you
to accept me, Sasuke.</i>

329
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:07,034
<i>That's all...I'm desperate.</i>

330
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,330
<i>Sasuke! Sasuke! Sasuke!</i>

331
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:19,838
<i>Naruto, this is
a once in a lifetime request.</i>

332
00:22:21,238 --> 00:22:25,242
<i>Please, bring Sasuke back!</i>

333
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,512
<i>Next time I'm coming with you.</i>

334
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,741
<i>Sasuke…</i>

335
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:47,157
Sasuke keeps getting
farther and farther away from me.

336
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:52,746
But Naruto, you've always
stuck by my side

337
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,790
and cheered me up.

338
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:59,252
Naruto, I finally realized…

339
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,194
Your true self.

340
00:23:03,525 --> 00:23:06,319
You used to be a prank-loving loser.

341
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:08,708
But now you've become
a wonderful person.

342
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,514
And I've witnessed it all, first-hand.

343
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,767
Meanwhile, Sasuke keeps adding
to his crimes,

344
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:15,418
and breaking my heart.

345
00:23:16,568 --> 00:23:18,862
Always becoming more of a stranger.

346
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:24,903
But you Naruto,
I'm able to be close to you like this.

347
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:26,848
You comfort me.

348
00:23:27,756 --> 00:23:30,217
I care about you,
from the bottom of my heart—

349
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,035
Cut it out, Sakura.

350
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,663
This joke isn't funny at all!

351
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,335
Why are you so upset?

352
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:44,714
I'm just telling you that I like you now
instead of Sasuke.

353
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:48,095
You know the saying, “women are
as fickle as the autumn weather.”

354
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:53,056
I hate people who lie to themselves!

355
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:58,961
I'm lying to myself?

356
00:24:02,318 --> 00:24:04,320
I'm the one who decides how I feel!

357
00:24:04,814 --> 00:24:07,150
If you hate me,
just come out and say so!

358
00:24:07,355 --> 00:24:08,940
Don't just make up a convenient excuse.

359
00:24:08,965 --> 00:24:10,800
But it doesn't make sense!

360
00:24:11,027 --> 00:24:14,281
You came all the way out here
just to tell me that?

361
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:15,662
"Just" to tell you?

362
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,747
"Just"?

363
00:24:18,347 --> 00:24:21,433
You don't think it's a big deal for
a girl to profess her love?!

364
00:24:22,123 --> 00:24:24,125
I came “all the way out here”?

365
00:24:24,591 --> 00:24:26,259
Of course,
I'd come all the way out here!

366
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,884
Sasuke, Sasuke, Sasuke!
That's all you think about!

367
00:24:28,909 --> 00:24:31,203
Going after Sasuke and
putting yourself in danger!

368
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,931
You're the Nine-Tails' Jinchuriki
and the Akatsuki are after you!

369
00:24:35,306 --> 00:24:37,808
Worry about yourself for a change.

370
00:24:38,494 --> 00:24:41,663
I'm saying that it's not necessary
to endanger yourself

371
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,565
just to chase after Sasuke!

372
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:48,320
I want you to come back to the village now,
that's why I'm here.

373
00:24:48,658 --> 00:24:49,659
That's all!

374
00:24:57,922 --> 00:25:00,925
I think it just sounds
like a painful excuse.

375
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,263
I know you pretty well, Sakura.

376
00:25:04,735 --> 00:25:06,903
Then why don't you understand?

377
00:25:07,418 --> 00:25:11,255
I don't care about Sasuke
now that he's a criminal.

378
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:14,735
So the promise between us
doesn't matter anymore.

379
00:25:17,628 --> 00:25:20,172
It's not just about the promise.

380
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,146
I kind of understand more now,

381
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:26,358
about why Sasuke has become
obsessed with revenge

382
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:29,110
and is causing so much damage.

383
00:25:32,783 --> 00:25:36,495
Sasuke loved his family and his clan.

384
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:40,523
Because his love was so deep,
it's hard for him to forgive.

385
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:42,724
If he were so devoted,

386
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:45,752
why would he join the Akatsuki after
defeating the unforgivable Itachi?

387
00:25:46,188 --> 00:25:47,687
That's not how it went down.

388
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:48,713
Naruto!

389
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,512
It doesn't matter, even if
there's no promise between us anymore.

390
00:25:56,471 --> 00:26:00,308
I personally want to save Sasuke.

391
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,686
What now, Sakura?

392
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,281
Maybe you should just
tell him the truth.

393
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:12,904
Oww!

394
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,781
Forget it! I'm going back.

395
00:26:16,363 --> 00:26:18,990
Let's go, Kiba, Lee, Sai!

396
00:26:20,165 --> 00:26:21,166
Sakura…

397
00:26:21,805 --> 00:26:22,890
Let's go.

398
00:26:29,251 --> 00:26:31,795
<i>Naruto…I'm sorry!</i>

399
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,228
Are you okay with this, Sakura?

400
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,317
Kiba, I need a favor.

401
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:51,401
What is it?

402
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,445
I'm going to start looking
for Sasuke right now!

403
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:54,989
Will you help me?

404
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:30,398
If we just got rid of the Eight-Tails'
and Nine-Tails' hosts,

405
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:33,777
we could stop Madara's plan and

406
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,363
weaken the military power of
the Cloud and the Leaf.

407
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:37,864
We could kill two bird
with one stone!

408
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,992
It was agreed that this time,
we will do no such thing.

409
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,870
Why not?! That's not like you,
Stubborn Geezer!

410
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:49,543
<i>Then let me ask you this.</i>

411
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:53,463
<i>Sure. I will answer anything, kid.</i>

412
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:57,342
<i>When did you all forsake yourselves?</i>

413
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,057
It's because I remembered.

414
00:28:04,357 --> 00:28:05,358
Remembered what?

415
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:10,146
I remembered who I was
before I became so stubborn!

416
00:28:18,772 --> 00:28:22,651
He may be big,
but he's not a bear worth shredding!

417
00:28:22,947 --> 00:28:24,991
Ponta is a raccoon!

418
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,873
You will feel the passion of my wrath!

419
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:33,712
<i>Passion? So you can use it
in this sort of situation.</i>

420
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,880
<i>Okay, got it!</i>

421
00:28:35,905 --> 00:28:39,451
<i>I'd better add that Ponta is a raccoon.</i>

422
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:41,845
So you mean…

423
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,014
You're going to get in my way!

424
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,067
Yosaku Chop!

425
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:00,780
<i>He's watching my moves and using
Lightning Style enhanced ninja tools</i>

426
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:02,236
<i>from mid-range distances.</i>

427
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:11,458
<i>But it's also a diversionary tactic
to try to confine me.</i>

428
00:29:11,676 --> 00:29:14,261
<i>Now twice you shall be perfo-rated.
Don't let that make me hated.</i>

429
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:26,973
What's going on?!

430
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:30,727
Bee's Super Vibrato Lightning Blade
didn't pierce through?

431
00:29:31,063 --> 00:29:32,064
Well then…

432
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,610
Eight-Tails' Cloak!

433
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:39,986
<i>Head butt!</i>

434
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,865
You...My chakra…

435
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,950
Bee! I saw it!

436
00:29:46,155 --> 00:29:50,285
It's that sword!
It's sucking away your chakra!

437
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:56,127
It probably absorbed the chakra out
of your Super Vibrato Lightning Blade

438
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,254
before it even made contact!

439
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:01,382
That's why it didn't pierce through.

440
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:09,098
Your octopus-flavored chakra
must be very appealing.

441
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,477
It's rare that Samehada
gets this worked up.

442
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,979
You are worthy of shredding.

443
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,982
Your eyes are cute, it's so surprising.

444
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,610
But making them into dead fish eyes…
is what I'm devising.

445
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:27,659
You...Umm…

446
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,043
Kisame Hoshigaki,
pleased to meet you after the fact.

447
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:42,757
It appears to be a jutsu
where a seed-like clone

448
00:30:43,057 --> 00:30:48,437
parasitizes a life form with chakra
and feeds on its host's chakra.

449
00:30:49,148 --> 00:30:51,317
So that's why you didn't notice it.

450
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:54,947
Most likely a ninjutsu of the Akatsuki
we saw at the meeting.

451
00:30:55,584 --> 00:30:59,964
And what about the other one
who has been following us all along?

452
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:02,627
He continues to tail us.

453
00:31:03,005 --> 00:31:05,299
Probably the Byakugan user
from the Hidden Mist.

454
00:31:05,853 --> 00:31:06,951
Him?

455
00:31:10,734 --> 00:31:11,735
There.

456
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,877
It would be a stroke of luck
if he falls for this.

457
00:31:19,936 --> 00:31:22,981
Your traps are special.
It'll work.

458
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:28,553
Dead or alive, make sure
you gouge out his right eye.

459
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:29,814
Yes, sir!

460
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:35,059
Judging from the markings,
Ao went this way.

461
00:31:35,409 --> 00:31:36,619
Let us hurry.

462
00:31:36,777 --> 00:31:37,485
Yes, ma'am!

463
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:42,919
Take care of my body, Torune.

464
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:02,253
A booby trap. It must be Danzo's.

465
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,892
<i>Why am I seeing my own body?!</i>

466
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:19,020
Gotcha.

467
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:20,772
<i>What's going on?</i>

468
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,316
You are under my Mind Transfer
Puppet Curse Jutsu.

469
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,986
<i>Damn it! Was this
a curse-type Mind Transfer Jutsu</i>

470
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:29,072
<i>that activates itself when
the object is attacked?!</i>

471
00:32:29,349 --> 00:32:33,186
Your mind is now sealed inside
that puppet.

472
00:32:34,506 --> 00:32:36,466
And I am in possession…

473
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,667
Of your body.

474
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:49,342
Damn it. It's useless.

475
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:51,327
<i>Forget it.</i>

476
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:54,806
<i>That is a barrier ninjutsu that
only us Hidden Mist Black Ops,</i>

477
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,391
<i>the shinobi tracking unit, can undo.</i>

478
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:59,936
<i>My Byakugan is precious,
the only one that the Mist possesses.</i>

479
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:03,690
<i>Do not think that you'll be able
to reclaim it easily.</i>

480
00:33:04,529 --> 00:33:07,949
So it self-activates
when the eye is at risk, eh?

481
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:11,447
A fitting jutsu coming from you guys,

482
00:33:11,782 --> 00:33:13,701
also known as the Undertaker Squad.

483
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,453
I don't expect it to be easy.

484
00:33:18,027 --> 00:33:21,739
Taking your eye means that I,
as the jutsu caster, will lose my own eye.

485
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,751
You know that.

486
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,421
<i>So it's Danzo's orders?</i>

487
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,756
<i>Just what does he think of
his subordinates?</i>

488
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:32,135
If the Mist's military power becomes
greatly diminished because of it,

489
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,012
losing one of my eyes is
a cheap price to pay.

490
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:37,557
Though, thanks to your barrier,
it's not going to happen at this rate.

491
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:41,227
But there are plenty of other options.

492
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,566
What do you plan to do?

493
00:33:48,453 --> 00:33:51,504
I'm simply going to jump down
and behead you.

494
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,697
If I can't remove your eye,

495
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:55,491
then I'll just have to take
your entire head back to the Leaf with me.

496
00:33:55,516 --> 00:33:56,725
<i>You're going to kill yourself?</i>

497
00:33:56,909 --> 00:34:01,164
No. I'll undo this Mind Transfer Jutsu
just before the blade cuts your neck.

498
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,166
Either way, you'll die.

499
00:34:04,391 --> 00:34:11,148
And I, back in my body, can retrace
my steps here to grab your head.

500
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:14,802
<i>Fine. Just make sure you're careful.</i>

501
00:34:15,092 --> 00:34:16,885
<i>Or else you'll fail.</i>

502
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,432
What do you mean?

503
00:34:19,936 --> 00:34:22,994
<i>Because if you get nervous and
release that jutsu an instant too soon,</i>

504
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:25,229
<i>I'll defend myself from your sickle!</i>

505
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:28,816
<i>If I'm not dead,</i>

506
00:34:28,939 --> 00:34:31,961
<i>the tables will be turned
when you come to get my head.</i>

507
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,154
<i>Remember that.</i>

508
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,126
Saved.

509
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,711
What happened?

510
00:34:49,756 --> 00:34:53,010
I was caught in the enemy's jutsu
and couldn't move my body.

511
00:34:53,872 --> 00:34:55,708
If you hadn't come, I would be dead.

512
00:34:56,081 --> 00:34:59,293
That was a very close call.

513
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:01,299
I'm sorry I made you worry.

514
00:35:02,943 --> 00:35:04,445
Couldn't move?

515
00:35:05,487 --> 00:35:07,323
It must have been a genjutsu
or something.

516
00:35:08,115 --> 00:35:10,284
It was a type of Mind Transfer Jutsu.

517
00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:11,820
Your right eye…

518
00:35:12,293 --> 00:35:15,004
The enemy was after the Byakugan,
weren't they?

519
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:17,031
They almost succeeded in smashing it.

520
00:35:18,277 --> 00:35:21,280
I'm sorry, but can you untie me?

521
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,371
Of course.

522
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:26,791
I'll also undo that jutsu protecting
your right eye.

523
00:35:27,422 --> 00:35:29,507
Thank you, that will help.

524
00:35:32,606 --> 00:35:34,608
What is that?

525
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,095
<i>No!</i>

526
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:42,140
<i>He hasn't undone
the Mind Transfer Jutsu yet!</i>

527
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,602
<i>She fell for it.</i>

528
00:35:46,892 --> 00:35:48,910
<i>If the Mizukage can undo the jutsu
protecting this right eye,</i>

529
00:35:48,935 --> 00:35:50,061
<i>I couldn't ask for anything better.</i>

530
00:35:50,142 --> 00:35:53,521
<i>I can destroy the Byakugan and
then undo the Mind Transfer Jutsu.</i>

531
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,486
This should do.

532
00:35:58,264 --> 00:35:59,599
Lady Mizukage?

533
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,618
Lend me your Hiramekarei, Chojuro.

534
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:04,537
Huh?

535
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,748
You are not Ao.

536
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,712
I cannot undo the jutsu
on that right eye.

537
00:36:13,287 --> 00:36:15,748
Ao knows that well.

538
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:20,803
Besides, Ao would never apologize
to Chojuro.

539
00:36:21,831 --> 00:36:24,917
You played me…
you sly old vixen—

540
00:36:24,942 --> 00:36:27,319
<i>Ow!</i>

541
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:35,526
I-I wasn't the one who said that…ma'am.

542
00:36:35,743 --> 00:36:38,141
Oh, you're back to normal.

543
00:36:38,166 --> 00:36:41,502
I'll kill him!
That Sensory-Type Hidden Leaf ninja!

544
00:36:42,044 --> 00:36:45,339
It's a good thing she didn't use
the Hiramekarei on you, sir.

545
00:36:47,698 --> 00:36:48,445
Foo.

546
00:36:49,327 --> 00:36:50,036
Well?

547
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:53,644
Forgive me, sir. I have failed.

548
00:36:54,556 --> 00:36:56,141
It cannot be helped.

549
00:37:03,578 --> 00:37:06,206
Kisame Hoshigaki, eh?

550
00:37:06,783 --> 00:37:08,701
Ink in your mouth…

551
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:11,938
The rumors are true.
You really are an octopus brat.

552
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:16,567
I'm gonna make you weep!
You sharky creep!

553
00:37:21,828 --> 00:37:25,551
<i>A Tailed Beast Cloak with
only seven chakra tails…</i>

554
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,828
<i>Does this mean
you're going to get serious?</i>

555
00:37:28,363 --> 00:37:29,364
Did you know?

556
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:30,790
Know what?

557
00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:35,170
Octopi eat sharks!

558
00:37:44,852 --> 00:37:45,613
Bee!

559
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:52,100
This time, the shark shall
devour the octopus.

560
00:37:52,695 --> 00:37:56,659
<i>That sword Samehada's got
a big appetite and it's a speed-eater,</i>

561
00:37:56,684 --> 00:38:00,602
<i>but it looks like it can only devour
six tails' worth of chakra at one time.</i>

562
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:08,707
<i>If that's the situation with this version,</i>

563
00:38:08,732 --> 00:38:11,026
<i>then my next version
should do the trick.</i>

564
00:38:13,395 --> 00:38:17,483
Samehada has never grown
this big before.

565
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:20,548
Its delight is not trivial either.

566
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:22,591
What'll we do, Bee?

567
00:38:24,171 --> 00:38:25,881
<i>Enter Tailed Beast State, Bee!</i>

568
00:38:26,193 --> 00:38:28,472
<i>No way, fool, ya fool!</i>

569
00:38:28,574 --> 00:38:30,766
<i>An attack with you would
be way too huge</i>

570
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,476
<i>and would destroy the area.</i>

571
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,991
<i>Master Kin and Ponta are
here with us, don't forget!</i>

572
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,942
<i>Besides, I finally managed to
sneak off under the radar.</i>

573
00:38:40,191 --> 00:38:43,778
<i>If I let you out, it'll be like
announcing that Killer Bee is here!</i>

574
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:46,741
<i>It's not like you to make excuses, Bee!</i>

575
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,662
<i>So what'll you do?
Fight in Version 2 State?</i>

576
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,538
<i>Oh yeah.</i>

577
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:57,543
<i>'Cept most of my chakra got taken away
during those last few exchanges,</i>

578
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,670
<i>so lend me yours.</i>

579
00:39:01,637 --> 00:39:05,099
<i>If it weren't for me,
you'd have lost a long time ago.</i>

580
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,053
Ya sure got a cheeky personality,

581
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:10,389
but I'm still grateful for
your hospitality, yeah!

582
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,016
Huh?

583
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,899
Going into a Tailed Beast State, eh?

584
00:39:20,092 --> 00:39:23,554
No, this is a Tailed Beast's power
trapped in a humanoid form.

585
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,363
It's Version 2 State!

586
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:30,159
<i>Lariat!</i>

587
00:39:33,019 --> 00:39:36,147
<i>Samehada is so excited
it's tripping out.</i>

588
00:39:36,494 --> 00:39:40,498
<i>The chakra earlier is nothing compared
to this volume and quality.</i>

589
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:45,549
<i>I'm amazed he can control this
much chakra without losing his mind.</i>

590
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,315
You did it!

591
00:40:02,146 --> 00:40:04,898
I can't believe I was reduced back
to Version 1 State.

592
00:40:05,655 --> 00:40:08,533
He's still alive! Hurry and finish him!

593
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:12,952
You've sure done it.

594
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:21,608
What is that?!

595
00:40:24,478 --> 00:40:29,942
The stronger my opponent,
the stronger I become.

596
00:40:30,432 --> 00:40:32,309
I do not tire.

597
00:40:33,701 --> 00:40:35,619
I do not fall.

598
00:40:36,409 --> 00:40:38,620
So his blade steals his enemy's chakra

599
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:41,648
and transfers it to its master
in the form of stamina?

600
00:40:44,941 --> 00:40:50,005
And that's why
I'm called the Tailless Tailed Beast.

601
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:53,409
<i>Water Style:
Super Exploding Water Shock Wave!</i>

602
00:41:00,475 --> 00:41:02,852
The longer this battle drags on,

603
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:06,464
the more chakra will be shaved from you
and the greater you will weaken.

604
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:11,845
And I'll grow proportionately stronger.

605
00:41:12,152 --> 00:41:14,780
<i>Bee! You must take his sword away!</i>

606
00:41:15,088 --> 00:41:18,216
<i>That sword is the key to his strength!</i>

607
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:26,567
That's if you can pull it off my body.

608
00:41:32,472 --> 00:41:35,058
<i>At this rate,
both Master Kin and Ponta will drown.</i>

609
00:41:35,434 --> 00:41:38,395
<i>First, we have to get out of the water!</i>

610
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:43,584
You cannot escape this Water Style Jutsu.

611
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:48,506
I have the advantage in
this location right now.

612
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:54,929
<i>I can't see the boundary!
So much water! So crazy!</i>

613
00:41:56,983 --> 00:42:00,736
<i>These circumstances are hunky-dory!
I won't be taken down, sorry!</i>

614
00:42:01,074 --> 00:42:03,118
<i>This isn't the time for
your lame rapping!</i>

615
00:42:04,324 --> 00:42:06,493
<i>The water bubble is in motion</i>

616
00:42:06,521 --> 00:42:08,815
<i>and that half-fish guy
is at the center!</i>

617
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,069
<i>Pay attention!</i>

618
00:42:10,812 --> 00:42:13,523
<i>And he's faster under water
than we are!</i>

619
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:17,368
<i>Plus he's half fish,
so he probably breathes through gills!</i>

620
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,079
<i>Just running away
is gonna get us killed.</i>

621
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:21,789
<i>So what'll we do?</i>

622
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,500
<i>Akatsuki's target is you, Bee!</i>

623
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,169
<i>Leave that enka geezer
and the raccoon</i>

624
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,213
<i>and run in a different direction!</i>

625
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:32,052
<i>He's definitely gonna come after you.</i>

626
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,593
<i>I see. That way, those two can…</i>

627
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:39,657
<i>Right! While he's pursuing you,
the water will move with him.</i>

628
00:42:39,874 --> 00:42:42,126
<i>Then those two can
get out of the water.</i>

629
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,358
<i>All right! Now come this way!</i>

630
00:42:51,691 --> 00:42:52,817
<i>What?!</i>

631
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:56,907
I must capture the Eight-Tails alive,

632
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:00,202
but there's no rule against
killing these two!

633
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:02,538
<i>I ain't letting that happen, ya fool!</i>

634
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,248
<i>Wha—?!</i>

635
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,041
I got you!

636
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,297
Suction pads?!

637
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:12,798
<i>Gotcha!</i>

638
00:43:12,953 --> 00:43:15,624
<i>No way will you keep
taking my chakra.</i>

639
00:43:15,649 --> 00:43:17,442
<i>Fool, ya fool!</i>

640
00:43:17,874 --> 00:43:21,432
You really are worthy of being
called the perfect Jinchuriki.

641
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:25,603
To be able to change just one part of
yourself into your Tailed Beast is impressive.

642
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,484
<i>All right, they're out.</i>

643
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:46,224
You seem to be
having trouble breathing.

644
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:51,962
It was a good idea,
but as long as you're touching me,

645
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:54,882
you'll continue losing chakra.

646
00:43:57,676 --> 00:44:00,971
<i>I can see why Samehada
can't contain his excitement.</i>

647
00:44:01,357 --> 00:44:05,737
<i>He has discovered
his favorite kind of chakra.</i>

648
00:44:06,021 --> 00:44:10,234
<i>No one in the Akatsuki is as good as
I am at taking prey alive.</i>

649
00:44:10,567 --> 00:44:13,709
<i>This Water Prison Shark Dance Jutsu
is so much fun</i>

650
00:44:14,057 --> 00:44:16,795
<i>because I can probe
the amount of chakra to shave</i>

651
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:20,282
<i>until you're just on the verge of death.</i>

652
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,079
I must admit to failing once in a while.

653
00:44:26,029 --> 00:44:30,200
<i>I guess I have to use Lariat again.
I just have to time it right.</i>

654
00:44:30,815 --> 00:44:31,900
<i>Don't!</i>

655
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,484
<i>You can't beat him underwater!</i>

656
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:38,342
<i>That last attempt with
the octopus leg put him on guard.</i>

657
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:40,135
<i>Just make a run for it!</i>

658
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:41,512
<i>Use that!</i>

659
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,687
<i>Ink...A smokescreen.</i>

660
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:59,863
<i>You are an octopus, after all.</i>

661
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,532
<i>However…</i>

662
00:45:03,683 --> 00:45:09,314
With my body merged with Samehada,
I can detect chakra through my skin.

663
00:45:10,793 --> 00:45:14,422
It seems you'll run
out of chakra soon.

664
00:45:19,815 --> 00:45:20,671
Bee…

665
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:27,474
I'm coming…Bee!

666
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:33,313
The Eight-Tails turned out to
be rather disappointing too.

667
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:47,327
I can't chance you squirming around

668
00:45:47,352 --> 00:45:49,521
and going into
a Tailed Beast State again.

669
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:54,168
So I'm going to cut off your legs
as a precaution.

670
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:57,254
Though, my blade doesn't cut cleanly!

671
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,220
What's the matter?

672
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:18,817
Don't tell me you've become
attached to the Eight-Tails.

673
00:46:19,893 --> 00:46:24,522
You like his chakra that much, Samehada?

674
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:29,578
That was chakra you took from me!

675
00:46:39,856 --> 00:46:43,860
Very well.
Shall we exchange weapons then?

676
00:46:49,794 --> 00:46:51,338
This sword…

677
00:46:54,825 --> 00:46:57,619
It looks like it has a nice, sharp edge!

678
00:47:01,071 --> 00:47:02,248
<i>A pencil?!</i>

679
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:12,412
Too bad.

680
00:47:13,382 --> 00:47:15,843
Definitely too bad.

681
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,044
So that was your plan, eh?

682
00:47:23,456 --> 00:47:25,708
Sorry we're late, Bee.

683
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:27,594
Brother…

684
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:31,130
Raikage? How did you find us?

685
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:34,977
That mass of water you created
was quite visible.

686
00:47:35,195 --> 00:47:39,032
And I perceived Bee and
the Eight-Tails' chakra mixed inside it.

687
00:47:39,539 --> 00:47:42,359
You really went to town sucking up
someone else's chakra

688
00:47:42,384 --> 00:47:43,927
and using it for yourself.

689
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:46,655
It was so obvious.

690
00:47:47,982 --> 00:47:50,443
Guess you found us, after all.

691
00:47:55,091 --> 00:47:58,762
That Samehada...It's giving
the Eight-Tails more chakra!

692
00:47:58,787 --> 00:47:59,830
Let's do it.

693
00:48:00,654 --> 00:48:02,865
Okay, Brother.

694
00:48:04,199 --> 00:48:05,993
<i>Water Style:
Super Shark Bomb—</i>

695
00:48:08,327 --> 00:48:10,412
— <i>Double Lariat!</i>
— <i>Double Lariat!</i>

696
00:48:12,082 --> 00:48:15,002
I must say, you two are too fast.

697
00:48:27,511 --> 00:48:28,512
Brother…

698
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:30,866
No!

699
00:48:31,568 --> 00:48:34,028
Wandering around by yourself!

700
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:39,416
Even ya non-dominant arm does me
a lot o' harm! Sound da alarm!

701
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:42,878
How was the lower level?

702
00:48:43,297 --> 00:48:45,008
Everyone was annihilated except for us.

703
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:48,050
It seems like two of Sasuke's subordinates
are still around here.

704
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:49,259
Did you see them?

705
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:50,969
We haven't seen them.

706
00:48:52,037 --> 00:48:53,497
They probably died too.

707
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:55,515
Everything is a mess down there.

708
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:58,769
No. A Sensory-Type ninja
from the Hidden Cloud

709
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,812
confirmed that they survived.

710
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,941
They asked us to capture them
and then they left.

711
00:49:04,536 --> 00:49:06,246
Oh, is that so?

712
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,111
You two…

713
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,074
Remove your armor.

714
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:16,453
Oh my, it seems we've been found out.

715
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:24,127
Just as I thought,
that wasn't a very good plan.

716
00:49:27,462 --> 00:49:30,382
<i>Sakura, why did you do
something like that?</i>

717
00:49:34,899 --> 00:49:37,402
Sai! What are you doing here?

718
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:39,476
It's a clone.

719
00:49:40,214 --> 00:49:41,674
I'm going to tell you

720
00:49:41,699 --> 00:49:44,744
what Sakura really wanted to say earlier,
but couldn't.

721
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,944
What do you mean, Sai?

722
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:55,158
Sakura didn't come to
confess her love for you.

723
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,829
The Hidden Leaf ninja have
come to a consensus

724
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,163
and I'm here to inform you.

725
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,036
I thought it was strange.

726
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:07,004
So she was hiding something after all.

727
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,590
The Hidden Leaf will deal with Sasuke.

728
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:15,137
Every one of your comrades is committed
to that and will act accordingly.

729
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:22,477
Did Sakura…
Did Sakura really agree to that?!

730
00:50:22,741 --> 00:50:25,827
Sakura loves Sasuke so much!

731
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:27,107
And yet…

732
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:29,336
How could she?!

733
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:32,863
After Akatsuki's attack on our village,

734
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:36,158
the Hidden Leaf ninja can no longer
recognize Sasuke as one of their own,

735
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:37,951
not after he supported the Akatsuki.

736
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,287
Sakura is not a fool.

737
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:44,374
She's not a child who wouldn't understand
the difficulty of the situation.

738
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,296
That's why we came here in person
to try to explain it to you.

739
00:50:54,762 --> 00:50:58,933
Then why didn't she just come out
and tell me the truth?

740
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:01,433
It wasn't that simple.
You know that.

741
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:04,895
She understood how hurt
you would feel.

742
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,105
But still…

743
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:11,818
To be honest, Sakura made us promise
not to tell you the truth.

744
00:51:13,197 --> 00:51:15,408
She said she would tell you somehow.

745
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:18,492
She said it was her duty to do so.

746
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:24,247
This is just an assumption on my part.

747
00:51:25,623 --> 00:51:27,041
But I believe Sakura…

748
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,755
She intends to kill Sasuke herself.

749
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:35,050
Is that true, Sai?!

750
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:38,136
Probably.

751
00:51:42,867 --> 00:51:45,119
<i>Please don't take it all on yourself.</i>

752
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:48,321
<i>I feel the same way as you.</i>

753
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,857
<i>So does everyone else.</i>

754
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:53,443
<i>Oh…yeah.</i>

755
00:51:54,517 --> 00:51:56,144
<i>Thank you, Sai.</i>

756
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,907
<i>I know.</i>

757
00:52:01,377 --> 00:52:04,672
Sakura smiled and told everyone
she would cooperate.

758
00:52:05,173 --> 00:52:08,509
But this time,
I saw through her fake smile.

759
00:52:09,596 --> 00:52:13,433
No way.
Sakura wouldn't do such a thing.

760
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:17,050
She's crazy about Sasuke—

761
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:18,510
It's because she loves him so much

762
00:52:18,977 --> 00:52:22,815
that she can't bear to watch
Sasuke turn more and more evil.

763
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:27,185
It's because she loves him so much

764
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,980
that she wants to save Sasuke
from this path of evil.

765
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:35,610
Even if that means killing the one
she loves with her own hands.

766
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:41,783
That is how committed she is
to her love for Sasuke.

767
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:45,495
And in doing so, Naruto…

768
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:48,790
She's prepared to accept your hatred.

769
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:57,132
It's her way of atoning for
the lifelong burden she placed on you.

770
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:01,636
Until now, Sakura relied on you too much.

771
00:53:02,783 --> 00:53:05,661
This time, she intends to resolve
everything alone.

772
00:53:10,543 --> 00:53:11,234
Sai…

773
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:15,150
Why are you telling me all this?

774
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,402
I couldn't ignore what Sakura's doing.

775
00:53:18,417 --> 00:53:20,252
And besides, I belong to Team 7.

776
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:22,908
I see.

777
00:53:38,669 --> 00:53:42,005
There is something
you must hear immediately.

778
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:45,805
We will tell you everything that happened
at the Five Kage Summit.

779
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:51,270
I see.

780
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,981
Who would have thought the meeting
would become so intense.

781
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:57,400
I guess with Danzo…

782
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:01,905
I'm not too eager about
becoming the Hokage.

783
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:05,659
And even if the situation
requires me to accept…

784
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:08,328
I'll have to return to
Hidden Leaf Village first

785
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,872
and hear what the others say.

786
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:14,501
Madara has declared war on us!

787
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:17,128
There's no time to deliberate.

788
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:21,508
I'm sure everyone will approve.

789
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:24,052
We should have them proceed
on the premise

790
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,054
that you are the Hokage, Kakashi.

791
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:30,243
If our response is delayed and the
Akatsuki and Madara take the advantage,

792
00:54:30,268 --> 00:54:32,436
that would be even worse.

793
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:36,481
I guess you're right. Thanks.

794
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:41,311
And Sasuke…

795
00:54:44,779 --> 00:54:47,365
For him to attack the summit…

796
00:54:48,597 --> 00:54:53,310
Naruto, this is a battle to protect
the Eight-Tails and the Nine-Tails.

797
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:56,668
Namely you.

798
00:54:57,588 --> 00:54:59,882
And it's also for the ninja world.

799
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:04,569
As the Kazekage,
I would give my life to protect you.

800
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,205
If Sasuke Uchiha confronts

801
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:11,161
the Allied Shinobi Forces
as a member of the Akatsuki,

802
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,184
I will show no mercy.

803
00:55:18,146 --> 00:55:21,316
Sasuke doesn't care about you.

804
00:55:21,937 --> 00:55:24,398
All he wants is darkness.

805
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:32,329
Naruto, you told me,
"I am going to be the Hokage."

806
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:35,957
I have become the Kazekage.

807
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:51,081
If you are prepared to bear
the burden of being a Kage,

808
00:55:51,776 --> 00:55:55,571
then do what is right
as Sasuke's friend.

809
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:07,426
We've said everything we needed to say.

810
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:09,616
Let's go, Gaara.

811
00:56:11,778 --> 00:56:14,114
We will return to our village.

812
00:56:15,508 --> 00:56:16,843
Kakashi Hatake…

813
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:19,300
With the understanding that
you will be Hokage,

814
00:56:19,325 --> 00:56:20,660
the Sand will take action.

815
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:22,462
As allied nations,

816
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:24,839
I pray that there will be
no conflicting intel between us.

817
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:27,509
Understood.

818
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:38,645
I consider you my friend.

819
00:56:41,271 --> 00:56:44,857
In the past,
"friend" was merely a word to me.

820
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,862
Nothing more, nothing less.

821
00:56:48,932 --> 00:56:51,601
But after meeting you,
you made me realize that…

822
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:55,954
The meaning of that word
is what's important.

823
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:59,833
What does it mean?

824
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:06,756
What can you do for Sasuke?
Think hard about that.

825
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:10,888
Let's go.

826
00:57:18,656 --> 00:57:19,657
Naruto…

827
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,148
Let him find the answer himself.

828
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:26,943
So? What do we do now?

829
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:31,656
In any case, I think we should
return to the Hidden Leaf

830
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:34,033
and report what happened
at the summit.

831
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,651
And also about Sakura.

832
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:40,415
The real me is accompanying Sakura.

833
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,959
She won't be allowed
to get near Sasuke!

834
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:45,753
You can count on that.

835
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:50,758
But it would be better to go
in person and talk her out of it.

836
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:56,473
All right.

837
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:01,060
Yamato, take Naruto and
head back to the village.

838
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:03,563
I'll bring Sakura back.

839
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:06,441
Sakura is no match for Sasuke.

840
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:08,248
It would be like
she's going there to die.

841
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:12,872
I'll dispatch the ninja Hounds with a
report about the summit since it's urgent.

842
00:58:13,474 --> 00:58:14,475
Understood.

843
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:17,911
Sai...Take me to Sakura.

844
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,162
Yes.

845
00:58:40,898 --> 00:58:42,608
<i>Itachi Uchiha…</i>

846
00:58:42,895 --> 00:58:45,939
<i>His life was one of
personal sacrifice.</i>

847
00:58:46,742 --> 00:58:50,912
<i>For the village and more importantly,
for his younger brother.</i>

848
00:58:51,905 --> 00:58:55,366
<i>Sasuke lost everything,
and he was left all alone,</i>

849
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:58,718
<i>in exchange for peace
in Hidden Leaf Village.</i>

850
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:01,205
<i>Can you still blame Sasuke?</i>

851
00:59:02,222 --> 00:59:05,141
<i>Sasuke said that he couldn't forgive
the Hidden Leaf</i>

852
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:08,503
<i>for sacrificing Itachi's life
to secure peace.</i>

853
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:11,631
<i>He is doing everything out
of a desire for revenge.</i>

854
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:16,970
<i>He is the real thing.
A true avenger.</i>

855
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:21,307
<i>Hatred...It is Sasuke's ninja way!</i>

856
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:37,740
<i>The Hidden Leaf will deal
with Sasuke.</i>

857
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,576
<i>Every one of your comrades
is committed to that</i>

858
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:41,160
<i>and will act accordingly.</i>

859
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:45,081
<i>Sakura intends to
kill Sasuke herself.</i>

860
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:53,481
<i>If you are prepared to bear
the burden of being a Kage,</i>

861
00:59:53,713 --> 00:59:57,717
<i>then do what is right as Sasuke's friend.</i>

862
01:00:10,132 --> 01:00:11,425
Calm down, Naruto!

863
01:00:11,722 --> 01:00:12,973
He's hyperventilating.

864
01:00:13,162 --> 01:00:14,413
Breathe slowly.

865
01:00:15,164 --> 01:00:16,123
<i>Naruto!</i>

866
01:00:16,232 --> 01:00:19,652
<i>Naruto…Can you hear me? Naruto?</i>

867
01:00:25,957 --> 01:00:26,958
You're finally awake?

868
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:31,711
Where am I?

869
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:33,463
You lost consciousness.

870
01:00:34,142 --> 01:00:35,442
You really had us worried.

871
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:37,550
Where are Kakashi Sensei and Sai?

872
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:42,391
You're going back to
the village with me.

873
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:44,766
They're Kakashi's orders.

874
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:55,985
I'm sorry, but you just have to
let Kakashi handle Sasuke.

875
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:57,355
Got it?

876
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:01,491
Fine.

877
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:05,244
Let me rest some more,
then we can head back to the village.

878
01:01:07,571 --> 01:01:11,200
You should eat a little
to restore your strength.

879
01:01:12,925 --> 01:01:15,928
I don't have an appetite.

880
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:29,977
It's been a long time, Danzo.

881
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:33,064
We haven't met since
the Uchiha incident.

882
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:54,794
Foo, Torune, assist me.

883
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,271
I'm going to break the seal
on my right arm.

884
01:01:57,581 --> 01:01:59,666
Keep him occupied.

885
01:02:01,743 --> 01:02:04,037
So you're going for it, Danzo?

886
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:08,244
Madara...His abilities are limitless.

887
01:02:08,404 --> 01:02:09,409
Be careful.

888
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:10,516
– Yes, sir.
– Yes, sir.

889
01:02:11,248 --> 01:02:14,209
Torune, we'll back each other up
and attack.

890
01:02:14,418 --> 01:02:15,460
I know.

891
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:23,804
<i>Mind Transfer…</i>

892
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:48,347
A Sensory-Type with Mind Transfer skills.

893
01:02:49,131 --> 01:02:50,966
A member of the Yamanaka Clan, huh?

894
01:02:55,622 --> 01:02:57,123
In order to protect himself,

895
01:02:57,148 --> 01:03:00,067
he de-materializes his body
at the moment of an attack

896
01:03:00,302 --> 01:03:03,222
and passes right through it.

897
01:03:03,825 --> 01:03:07,537
But he solidifies his body to make
physical contact when he attacks.

898
01:03:08,224 --> 01:03:10,435
We have to aim for the counterattack.

899
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:14,582
That was a well thought out analysis.

900
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:18,920
The counterattack must
be timed perfectly.

901
01:03:19,626 --> 01:03:23,380
We'll attack one after the other
and get him on the second stage.

902
01:03:24,463 --> 01:03:26,090
The first stage will be a diversion.

903
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:28,095
I'll be the decoy.

904
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:30,932
He's already seen through
my Mind Transfer Jutsu.

905
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:33,643
We'll go with your jutsu.

906
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:35,228
Got it.

907
01:03:49,104 --> 01:03:50,105
<i>Now!</i>

908
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:02,964
This guy…
He just pretended to attack.

909
01:04:03,489 --> 01:04:05,658
Damn it. We fell for it!

910
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:12,348
Hmm…

911
01:04:12,735 --> 01:04:15,946
A jutsu to flush in chakra
and destroy cells?

912
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:18,479
How troublesome.

913
01:04:19,897 --> 01:04:20,898
Forgive me, Foo.

914
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:22,567
I'll extract them right away.

915
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:30,074
This isn't chakra.

916
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:38,165
These are nano-sized venom beetles.

917
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:40,167
They are almost like bacteria.

918
01:04:42,375 --> 01:04:45,378
Insects that devour cells on contact.

919
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:48,426
I've heard of them.

920
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:52,431
You are a ninja from the Aburame Clan

921
01:04:52,456 --> 01:04:54,958
who knows Hidden ninjutsu.

922
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:58,602
I see. You're the son
of Shikuro Aburame,

923
01:04:58,627 --> 01:05:00,712
the one with immunity to those insects.

924
01:05:01,272 --> 01:05:02,732
To think you were in the Foundation.

925
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:04,859
Danzo!

926
01:05:06,085 --> 01:05:07,962
<i>You have yourself a good subordinate.</i>

927
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:12,570
Forgive me, Torune.

928
01:05:13,101 --> 01:05:14,561
Don't blame yourself, Foo.

929
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:17,262
Use your sensors to
locate him quickly.

930
01:05:19,426 --> 01:05:20,886
I'll get him the next time.

931
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:28,799
Damn it!

932
01:05:30,134 --> 01:05:31,928
<i>He sucked in Torune!</i>

933
01:05:34,949 --> 01:05:38,244
My right arm has been injected
with the venom beetles.

934
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:48,277
You're next.

935
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:04,877
Let me out of here.

936
01:06:06,003 --> 01:06:07,546
Don't be so hasty.

937
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:09,924
I'll let you go.

938
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:13,010
I have something for you outside.

939
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:30,403
Sasuke Uchiha.

940
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:32,780
You stay back.

941
01:06:33,614 --> 01:06:35,199
If you get involved, you'll die.

942
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:43,124
Perfect.

943
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:53,009
Sasuke...Madara…

944
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:57,596
I'll take both your Sharingan.

945
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:08,816
<i>W-What? That right arm…</i>

946
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:12,987
<i>It has many Sharingan!
It's disgusting!</i>

947
01:07:14,488 --> 01:07:16,657
How did you get those eyes
in your right arm?

948
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:22,872
Through various means.
It would take too long to describe.

949
01:07:23,854 --> 01:07:27,691
Any explanation would upset me more.

950
01:07:28,766 --> 01:07:32,102
Forget it. I've decided to kill you.

951
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:37,428
Before that, let me ask one thing.

952
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:46,520
Is it true that Itachi Uchiha eliminated
my clan by order of the Elders?

953
01:08:02,993 --> 01:08:05,745
So that's Sasuke's…

954
01:08:06,707 --> 01:08:09,752
So this is the Susano'o.

955
01:08:18,697 --> 01:08:20,699
I'm asking if it's true!

956
01:08:24,515 --> 01:08:25,766
Answer me!

957
01:08:26,141 --> 01:08:34,107
I...I didn't think Itachi was the kind
of man who would reveal secrets.

958
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:37,655
Does that mean it's true?

959
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:08,352
Self-sacrifice…
That's what epitomizes a shinobi.

960
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:12,189
Never seeing the light of day.
Toiling in the shadows.

961
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:16,235
It is as it was in the past.
That is what a true shinobi is.

962
01:09:18,195 --> 01:09:20,156
It describes not only Itachi.

963
01:09:20,197 --> 01:09:23,117
Countless other ninja have
died the same way.

964
01:09:23,742 --> 01:09:27,037
Niceties alone will not make
the world go round.

965
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:32,445
Peace was attained all
because of people like him.

966
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:35,921
People like you who misunderstood
Itachi's intentions

967
01:09:36,083 --> 01:09:38,669
couldn't possibly understand.

968
01:09:38,967 --> 01:09:42,345
Still…for Itachi to reveal such
a secret to you makes him

969
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:44,956
a traitor to the Leaf…

970
01:09:46,546 --> 01:09:48,840
Don't say anymore about Itachi!

971
01:09:49,642 --> 01:09:51,185
You're right.

972
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:54,899
Then let us proceed
to a battle of the eyes.

973
01:10:04,575 --> 01:10:05,987
<i>What's going on?!</i>

974
01:10:06,012 --> 01:10:08,014
<i>He should've died earlier!</i>

975
01:10:08,879 --> 01:10:11,548
<i>I can only sense chakra
from one Danzo.</i>

976
01:10:11,891 --> 01:10:13,803
<i>I'm certain it's not a clone!</i>

977
01:10:13,828 --> 01:10:16,455
As expected…Susano'o.

978
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:19,381
Just the thing to protect yourself.

979
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:30,351
The power in its attack is as expected.

980
01:10:36,935 --> 01:10:39,897
<i>Again? So if that wasn't
a clone either…</i>

981
01:10:41,115 --> 01:10:42,992
<i>Is it genjutsu?!</i>

982
01:10:43,912 --> 01:10:47,207
<i>Sasuke's inner chakra isn't disturbed.</i>

983
01:10:47,664 --> 01:10:49,958
<i>And my chakra is calm.</i>

984
01:10:50,412 --> 01:10:52,414
<i>What kind of jutsu is this?</i>

985
01:11:20,438 --> 01:11:21,441
<i>Amaterasu!</i>

986
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,582
Susano'o and even Amaterasu…

987
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,211
That's too much just to
test Danzo's power.

988
01:11:39,647 --> 01:11:40,653
He'll tire himself out.

989
01:11:47,276 --> 01:11:48,819
Sasuke! Behind you!

990
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:51,765
<i>Wind Style: Vacuum Bullets!</i>

991
01:12:04,867 --> 01:12:05,868
Sasuke!

992
01:12:08,307 --> 01:12:09,850
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

993
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:21,587
A new summoning jutsu?

994
01:12:21,612 --> 01:12:23,113
When did he get that?

995
01:12:27,351 --> 01:12:30,688
Amaterasu. It's been a while
since I last saw that.

996
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:33,557
You are Itachi's younger brother after all.

997
01:12:47,089 --> 01:12:49,424
You've taken over Itachi's jutsu.

998
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:52,652
I told you never to
speak of Itachi again!

999
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,829
Brothers with the same ability.

1000
01:12:55,854 --> 01:12:59,858
Yet, what your eyes perceive
is so different.

1001
01:13:00,874 --> 01:13:05,671
The truth about Itachi
isn't important to you.

1002
01:13:06,249 --> 01:13:09,544
You direct your hatred at whomever
you can lay your hands on.

1003
01:13:10,844 --> 01:13:15,641
You make the sacrifice of
the Uchiha Clan meaningless.

1004
01:13:15,974 --> 01:13:19,895
You have no right to talk
about the Uchiha!

1005
01:13:27,835 --> 01:13:29,507
<i>Wind Style: Vacuum Blast!</i>

1006
01:14:41,268 --> 01:14:42,352
Sasuke!

1007
01:15:06,793 --> 01:15:07,961
<i>This is…</i>

1008
01:15:12,266 --> 01:15:13,350
<i>No way!</i>

1009
01:15:20,723 --> 01:15:21,849
It's useless.

1010
01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:50,083
Th-This is…

1011
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:54,424
Itachi?

1012
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:00,430
Die…

1013
01:16:03,433 --> 01:16:04,434
<i>Amaterasu!</i>

1014
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:17,739
I commend you for placing me
under genjutsu.

1015
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:20,993
However…

1016
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:36,466
I was aware of your genjutsu
long ago.

1017
01:16:36,883 --> 01:16:39,428
It is a far cry from
Itachi's masterful Tsukuyomi

1018
01:16:39,469 --> 01:16:42,180
in which he freely manipulated time.

1019
01:16:45,809 --> 01:16:47,853
A Curse Mark that paralyzes the body.

1020
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:50,856
He must have placed it back then.

1021
01:16:55,027 --> 01:16:57,571
<i>Sasuke...You can't move?</i>

1022
01:17:13,253 --> 01:17:14,755
<i>Taijutsu, huh?</i>

1023
01:17:15,714 --> 01:17:18,925
<i>It seems he wants to
preserve his chakra.</i>

1024
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:27,643
<i>Release!</i>

1025
01:17:30,051 --> 01:17:32,762
<i>The flow of Danzo's chakra
has changed.</i>

1026
01:17:32,939 --> 01:17:34,191
<i>What's he up to?</i>

1027
01:17:38,111 --> 01:17:40,171
<i>If Sasuke knows the truth
about Itachi,</i>

1028
01:17:40,196 --> 01:17:41,906
<i>then the Akatsuki must know as well.</i>

1029
01:17:43,113 --> 01:17:46,032
<i>It's impossible to try to conceal
the information any longer.</i>

1030
01:17:53,627 --> 01:17:58,924
Why was it necessary to save
the life of such trash, Itachi?

1031
01:18:00,806 --> 01:18:05,602
He's your…ultimate mistake.

1032
01:18:14,398 --> 01:18:17,781
<i>But he could not kill…
his little brother.</i>

1033
01:18:19,431 --> 01:18:23,168
<i>He cried tears of blood and killed
every shred of feeling he had inside him,</i>

1034
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:26,910
<i>then he killed his brethren
for the sake of his village.</i>

1035
01:18:28,161 --> 01:18:30,539
<i>But he just couldn't kill you.</i>

1036
01:18:31,108 --> 01:18:33,068
<i>Do you understand what
that means?</i>

1037
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:53,437
<i>To him,</i>

1038
01:18:55,595 --> 01:18:57,514
<i>your life was more precious…</i>

1039
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,277
<i>Than the village.</i>

1040
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:22,382
<i>He broke free from the Curse Mark.</i>

1041
01:19:22,407 --> 01:19:23,992
<i>Is that Susano'o?</i>

1042
01:19:24,306 --> 01:19:26,600
<i>It's completely different from before!</i>

1043
01:19:29,973 --> 01:19:30,974
<i>All right.</i>

1044
01:19:31,558 --> 01:19:34,603
<i>His hatred has matured
and gained in power.</i>

1045
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:37,481
<i>And his body is responding to it.</i>

1046
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:39,107
<i>This is going well.</i>

1047
01:19:39,936 --> 01:19:42,856
<i>He doesn't need my help at all.</i>

1048
01:19:52,746 --> 01:19:54,581
<i>He's aiming for my landing.</i>

1049
01:19:54,915 --> 01:19:56,249
<i>I can't weave the signs in time!</i>

1050
01:19:56,249 --> 01:19:57,292
It can't be helped!

1051
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:15,393
<i>I managed to alter its path.</i>

1052
01:20:17,187 --> 01:20:20,398
<i>Danzo's chakra level
plummeted with that jutsu!</i>

1053
01:20:20,832 --> 01:20:24,936
<i>Why did he go to that extent
just to dodge Susano'o's attack?</i>

1054
01:20:26,325 --> 01:20:30,037
<i>The jutsu this guy's been using
is supposed to make him immortal.</i>

1055
01:20:34,704 --> 01:20:37,999
<i>So the jutsu he released
earlier was his own.</i>

1056
01:20:39,621 --> 01:20:40,955
<i>That was Wood Style.</i>

1057
01:20:41,628 --> 01:20:43,421
<i>I see. So that's why…</i>

1058
01:20:44,058 --> 01:20:46,352
<i>With that many Sharingan,</i>

1059
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:48,431
<i>I knew there had to be a secret</i>

1060
01:20:48,456 --> 01:20:51,876
<i>for someone not from the Uchiha
to be able to use them.</i>

1061
01:20:56,309 --> 01:20:57,769
<i>Damn Orochimaru…</i>

1062
01:20:58,129 --> 01:21:00,923
<i>It seems he and Danzo
have been in close contact.</i>

1063
01:21:06,507 --> 01:21:08,922
<i>He had the cells of
the First Hokage, Hashirama,</i>

1064
01:21:08,947 --> 01:21:11,533
<i>implanted in him to enhance
his physical energy.</i>

1065
01:21:11,606 --> 01:21:14,734
<i>That's how he was able
to control so many Sharingan.</i>

1066
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:20,250
<i>No, he can die!</i>

1067
01:21:20,714 --> 01:21:23,216
<i>If he hadn't countered that
earlier attack, he would have died.</i>

1068
01:21:23,521 --> 01:21:26,045
<i>That's why he exhausted
so much chakra!</i>

1069
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:28,884
Sasuke!

1070
01:21:29,249 --> 01:21:30,918
That's the real Danzo!

1071
01:21:31,361 --> 01:21:34,364
The jutsu that makes him invincible
is broken right now!

1072
01:21:34,712 --> 01:21:36,099
He's vulnerable!

1073
01:21:36,776 --> 01:21:39,362
<i>So that woman's a Sensory-Type ninja!</i>

1074
01:21:39,601 --> 01:21:41,770
<i>She figured me out.</i>

1075
01:21:42,067 --> 01:21:43,276
<i>But it's too late.</i>

1076
01:21:58,705 --> 01:22:00,457
<i>He activated the jutsu!</i>

1077
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:03,752
<i>I'm probably the only one
who can see that.</i>

1078
01:22:04,461 --> 01:22:07,964
<i>Susano'o's attack just then
was probably too late.</i>

1079
01:22:09,051 --> 01:22:10,052
<i>Damn it!</i>

1080
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:20,018
<i>As far as I can tell,
he has ten Sharingan in his arm,</i>

1081
01:22:20,499 --> 01:22:22,585
<i>as well as the First Hokage's cells.</i>

1082
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:26,983
<i>The power of the Uchiha
and Hashirama.</i>

1083
01:22:27,734 --> 01:22:31,154
<i>Looks like he intends
to control the Nine-Tails.</i>

1084
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:37,410
<i>So he's after Naruto too.</i>

1085
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:44,876
<i>Danzo's chakra level has
decreased some more.</i>

1086
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:48,838
<i>This jutsu carries a lot of risk
after all.</i>

1087
01:22:49,589 --> 01:22:50,799
<i>There's no mistake.</i>

1088
01:22:53,471 --> 01:22:56,933
This is the Visual jutsu that was forbidden
even among the Uchiha.

1089
01:22:57,178 --> 01:22:58,387
Izanagi…

1090
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:02,310
I didn't expect to see it here,
of all places.

1091
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:06,773
Sasuke!

1092
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:10,151
<i>Stay calm!</i>

1093
01:23:10,595 --> 01:23:15,308
The only thing I can do right now
is analyze Danzo's jutsu!

1094
01:23:24,582 --> 01:23:25,583
<i>Izanagi…</i>

1095
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:32,298
<i>Where in a brief moment in time,</i>

1096
01:23:32,772 --> 01:23:34,897
<i>anything disadvantageous
to the user of the jutsu,</i>

1097
01:23:34,922 --> 01:23:38,894
<i>like damage or death,
can be rewritten as a dream.</i>

1098
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:56,384
<i>And…</i>

1099
01:23:56,621 --> 01:23:59,526
<i>Anything advantageous,
such as the user's attacks,</i>

1100
01:23:59,659 --> 01:24:01,327
<i>is kept as part of reality.</i>

1101
01:24:02,269 --> 01:24:05,522
<i>The ability to control the space
between fantasy and reality.</i>

1102
01:24:06,451 --> 01:24:09,772
<i>An ultimate genjutsu cast upon oneself.</i>

1103
01:24:12,201 --> 01:24:16,288
<i>And the eye that uses
Izanagi loses its light,</i>

1104
01:24:16,952 --> 01:24:18,787
<i>never to open again.</i>

1105
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:26,895
<i>But…</i>

1106
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:28,855
<i>The number of eyes
he possesses…</i>

1107
01:24:29,522 --> 01:24:33,234
<i>The duration of Izanagi varies
with each user.</i>

1108
01:24:34,661 --> 01:24:37,164
<i>He wanted to extend the time
by whatever means</i>

1109
01:24:37,189 --> 01:24:39,692
<i>so he agreed to become
a test subject for Orochimaru.</i>

1110
01:24:43,244 --> 01:24:44,370
<i>Damn that Madara…</i>

1111
01:24:44,751 --> 01:24:47,337
<i>It doesn't seem like
he plans to join the battle,</i>

1112
01:24:47,752 --> 01:24:49,503
<i>but I cannot take any chances.</i>

1113
01:24:50,210 --> 01:24:53,463
<i>I must reserve enough power
to take him on.</i>

1114
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:55,860
<i>It will take some time</i>

1115
01:24:55,885 --> 01:24:58,721
<i>for the right eye I used
at the summit to recover.</i>

1116
01:25:02,183 --> 01:25:06,396
<i>However, this Susano'o
is not easy to deal with.</i>

1117
01:25:07,997 --> 01:25:11,646
<i>That arrow attack is difficult to dodge.</i>

1118
01:25:12,290 --> 01:25:15,053
<i>And I can't undo Izanagi yet.</i>

1119
01:25:21,533 --> 01:25:23,660
<i>I'll have to bet on this next minute.</i>

1120
01:25:25,286 --> 01:25:26,788
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

1121
01:25:56,321 --> 01:25:58,740
<i>With this, Susano'o won't
be able to move.</i>

1122
01:25:59,096 --> 01:26:01,015
<i>Wind Style: Vacuum Blast Barrage!</i>

1123
01:26:10,039 --> 01:26:11,040
<i>Fire Style:</i>

1124
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:13,001
<i>Fire Ball Jutsu!</i>

1125
01:26:40,945 --> 01:26:43,406
<i>53…54…55…</i>

1126
01:26:43,756 --> 01:26:48,678
<i>56…57…58…59…60.</i>

1127
01:26:52,477 --> 01:26:53,643
<i>Those eyes…</i>

1128
01:26:53,741 --> 01:26:56,411
<i>One closes every 60 seconds or so.</i>

1129
01:26:57,026 --> 01:27:00,988
<i>And during that time,
his chakra continues to drop drastically.</i>

1130
01:27:01,674 --> 01:27:02,675
<i>Which means…</i>

1131
01:27:02,826 --> 01:27:08,749
<i>That right arm shows how much time
that weird jutsu has left.</i>

1132
01:27:11,028 --> 01:27:12,029
<i>Four more left!</i>

1133
01:27:13,115 --> 01:27:16,535
Sasuke! I figured out
a little bit of that guy's jutsu!

1134
01:27:17,038 --> 01:27:18,707
Listen! All right?

1135
01:27:19,217 --> 01:27:22,303
When all ten of your eyes
have closed on your right arm,

1136
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:24,906
your jutsu will be undone,
isn't that so?

1137
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:28,326
You knew about Izanagi?

1138
01:27:28,868 --> 01:27:30,119
As I suspected!

1139
01:27:31,621 --> 01:27:33,039
You tricked me?

1140
01:27:33,164 --> 01:27:34,582
What a crafty brat.

1141
01:27:35,083 --> 01:27:37,418
Y-You fool!
Why are you engaging him?

1142
01:27:58,476 --> 01:28:01,270
Sasuke! Get away from him now!

1143
01:28:01,609 --> 01:28:02,652
Prolong the battle!

1144
01:28:31,264 --> 01:28:35,685
How many Uchiha did you kill
to get that right arm?!

1145
01:28:37,251 --> 01:28:39,629
It was Itachi who enabled me to get it.

1146
01:28:40,106 --> 01:28:42,025
You made him do it!

1147
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:59,500
<i>I guess this is the extent
of Sasuke's power.</i>

1148
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:06,090
You were too hasty.
My eye is still open.

1149
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:11,220
Go to Itachi so he can lecture you.

1150
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:13,890
I win.

1151
01:29:17,393 --> 01:29:19,937
<i>Why won't Izanagi activate?</i>

1152
01:29:32,075 --> 01:29:34,494
You're the one who's going
to see Itachi.

1153
01:29:44,670 --> 01:29:46,756
<i>It's a far cry from Itachi's Tsukuyomi,</i>

1154
01:29:46,756 --> 01:29:49,425
<i>in which he freely manipulated time
within a genjutsu.</i>

1155
01:29:49,759 --> 01:29:54,889
<i>But the trick lies in how you use</i>

1156
01:29:55,136 --> 01:29:56,888
<i>even a short, weak genjutsu.</i>

1157
01:29:57,558 --> 01:29:59,685
<i>In an instant,
before you were even aware,</i>

1158
01:29:59,727 --> 01:30:02,021
<i>Sasuke placed a genjutsu on you
and made you believe</i>

1159
01:30:02,522 --> 01:30:06,109
<i>that the last eye on your right arm
was still open.</i>

1160
01:30:06,804 --> 01:30:10,655
<i>You yourself were concerned about
the instability of the Izanagi's duration</i>

1161
01:30:10,696 --> 01:30:14,826
<i>and kept checking the Sharingan
on your right arm.</i>

1162
01:30:16,081 --> 01:30:18,375
<i>Sasuke did not miss that.</i>

1163
01:30:19,347 --> 01:30:21,933
<i>Very subtly, he wanted
to make you think</i>

1164
01:30:21,958 --> 01:30:24,627
<i>the Izanagi would last a little longer.</i>

1165
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:28,022
<i>He had already confirmed that
he could place you under genjutsu,</i>

1166
01:30:28,047 --> 01:30:30,133
<i>even if it was just for an instant.</i>

1167
01:30:30,883 --> 01:30:33,428
<i>And Sasuke seized that opportunity.</i>

1168
01:30:35,721 --> 01:30:37,938
<i>Because you also possess the Sharingan,</i>

1169
01:30:37,963 --> 01:30:41,091
<i>you underestimated how
to use it in battle.</i>

1170
01:30:41,686 --> 01:30:44,230
<i>Your arrogance led to your defeat.</i>

1171
01:30:48,484 --> 01:30:50,528
Now that's battling with your eyes.

1172
01:30:52,155 --> 01:30:53,823
Don't underestimate the Uchiha.

1173
01:30:54,662 --> 01:30:57,415
<i>Danzo didn't get to use Shisui's eye,</i>

1174
01:30:57,798 --> 01:31:01,552
<i>but you pressed him
into a corner, Sasuke.</i>

1175
01:31:03,499 --> 01:31:06,419
<i>Looks like I'll be able to take
Shisui's eye soon.</i>

1176
01:31:07,027 --> 01:31:09,905
<i>The Foundation should have
stayed hidden underground.</i>

1177
01:31:15,721 --> 01:31:16,722
Sasuke!

1178
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:20,308
Are you all right?

1179
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:22,977
Hurry up and bite!

1180
01:31:27,982 --> 01:31:31,027
<i>Bringing that woman was
a wise decision.</i>

1181
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:32,612
<i>She's useful.</i>

1182
01:31:33,394 --> 01:31:36,981
<i>I see why Sasuke chose her.</i>

1183
01:31:37,619 --> 01:31:41,540
<i>How could I…of all people…
lose to this brat?!</i>

1184
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:45,750
<i>I can't die here yet!</i>

1185
01:31:49,712 --> 01:31:54,467
<i>No, at this rate, I'll be taken over
by the First Hokage's cells!</i>

1186
01:31:58,995 --> 01:32:02,415
<i>He's near death and he's losing
the ability to control chakra.</i>

1187
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:06,637
<i>Hashirama's power is
not easy to control.</i>

1188
01:32:14,256 --> 01:32:16,675
What a persistent guy!

1189
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:27,416
Not yet…

1190
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:31,587
This is where we battle with our eyes.

1191
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:34,999
<i>The visual prowess in
his right eye has returned.</i>

1192
01:32:35,591 --> 01:32:42,473
<i>I see. He intended to use Izanagi
until Shisui's eye recuperated.</i>

1193
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:51,899
You used your visual prowess
too much, didn't you?

1194
01:32:52,209 --> 01:32:53,542
Sasuke…

1195
01:32:54,235 --> 01:32:56,291
<i>Sasuke is no longer useful.</i>

1196
01:32:56,316 --> 01:32:58,943
<i>As I thought, Madara's the one
I need to place</i>

1197
01:32:58,968 --> 01:33:00,386
<i>under genjutsu and manipulate.</i>

1198
01:33:00,533 --> 01:33:04,078
<i>I can't waste time, my wound is deep.</i>

1199
01:33:04,412 --> 01:33:06,872
Isn't it ironic that you,
who glorified self-sacrifice,

1200
01:33:07,016 --> 01:33:08,726
would take a hostage?

1201
01:33:09,030 --> 01:33:12,700
It's not that I consider my life precious.

1202
01:33:13,337 --> 01:33:16,841
But for the sake of Hidden Leaf Village…
for the ninja world…

1203
01:33:17,215 --> 01:33:20,301
I cannot afford to die here.

1204
01:33:20,686 --> 01:33:23,105
No matter what the means,
I must survive.

1205
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:29,270
For I will be the one reformer
who will change this ninja world.

1206
01:33:29,782 --> 01:33:32,493
This woman will be sacrificed
for that cause.

1207
01:33:32,571 --> 01:33:34,907
Sasuke help!

1208
01:33:35,318 --> 01:33:37,278
Don't move…Karin.

1209
01:33:46,810 --> 01:33:48,603
<i>That's what I wanted to see.</i>

1210
01:33:49,757 --> 01:33:53,344
Brother...One down.

1211
01:33:54,754 --> 01:33:58,090
<i>You didn't have time to cast Izanagi,
did you, Danzo?</i>

1212
01:33:58,841 --> 01:33:59,842
Karin…

1213
01:34:00,426 --> 01:34:02,470
Since you managed to
get taken hostage,

1214
01:34:02,511 --> 01:34:03,971
you're nothing but a burden to me.

1215
01:34:58,234 --> 01:34:59,402
Danzo…

1216
01:35:00,757 --> 01:35:02,717
I'm taking Shisui's eye.

1217
01:35:03,092 --> 01:35:06,012
<i>He took Shisui's eye?</i>

1218
01:35:26,554 --> 01:35:28,239
Are you all right, Danzo?

1219
01:35:28,264 --> 01:35:29,890
Why'd you interfere, Hiruzen?!

1220
01:35:31,058 --> 01:35:32,268
Don't say that.

1221
01:35:32,685 --> 01:35:35,813
We don't want to lose comrades
in a situation like this.

1222
01:35:38,524 --> 01:35:39,859
You're alive!

1223
01:35:40,192 --> 01:35:41,527
Kagami! Torifu!

1224
01:35:42,153 --> 01:35:43,696
Yeah, I managed somehow.

1225
01:35:44,196 --> 01:35:46,699
There are too many of them.
What'll we do, Hiruzen?

1226
01:35:47,116 --> 01:35:48,325
Yeah, you're right.

1227
01:35:48,924 --> 01:35:51,176
We should meet up with
the Second Hokage.

1228
01:35:56,448 --> 01:35:57,491
We're surrounded.

1229
01:35:58,529 --> 01:35:59,488
There are…

1230
01:36:00,143 --> 01:36:00,977
20 of them.

1231
01:36:02,465 --> 01:36:05,136
Judging from their tracking skills,
I'd say they're from the Hidden Cloud.

1232
01:36:05,639 --> 01:36:07,515
The highly skilled Kinkaku Unit.

1233
01:36:08,295 --> 01:36:10,589
There are seven of us including you,
Lord Hokage.

1234
01:36:11,223 --> 01:36:12,308
We're completely outnumbered.

1235
01:36:12,333 --> 01:36:14,586
Homura! Don't be such a coward.

1236
01:36:15,637 --> 01:36:18,515
The enemy hasn't pinpointed
our position yet.

1237
01:36:19,064 --> 01:36:22,443
We should lie in wait until we can find
an opportunity to break through.

1238
01:36:23,027 --> 01:36:24,195
It's no use, Koharu.

1239
01:36:24,435 --> 01:36:27,521
One of us will have to
divert their attention.

1240
01:36:27,990 --> 01:36:29,158
A decoy?

1241
01:36:29,427 --> 01:36:30,887
It means certain death.

1242
01:36:31,850 --> 01:36:32,851
So who?

1243
01:36:43,676 --> 01:36:44,885
<i>I am a shinobi.</i>

1244
01:36:45,665 --> 01:36:48,376
<i>I've made up my mind to die on
the battlefield like a proper shinobi.</i>

1245
01:36:49,495 --> 01:36:50,580
<i>Sarutobi…</i>

1246
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:53,849
<i>What are you thinking now?</i>

1247
01:36:55,105 --> 01:36:57,274
<i>Are you prepared to make
that sacrifice?</i>

1248
01:37:03,970 --> 01:37:06,639
<i>Go ahead! Say it! That I'll…</i>

1249
01:37:08,553 --> 01:37:09,554
<i>What's the matter?</i>

1250
01:37:09,865 --> 01:37:11,367
<i>Why can't I say it?</i>

1251
01:37:12,284 --> 01:37:13,369
I will go!

1252
01:37:15,165 --> 01:37:15,916
Sarutobi…

1253
01:37:16,121 --> 01:37:17,748
Hiruzen, you…

1254
01:37:18,782 --> 01:37:19,783
Don't worry!

1255
01:37:20,543 --> 01:37:24,046
I may not look it, but I know
I'm better than any of you.

1256
01:37:24,210 --> 01:37:25,378
I won't die.

1257
01:37:26,677 --> 01:37:29,388
<i>My trembling…stopped.</i>

1258
01:37:30,354 --> 01:37:32,607
<i>Damn it! I'm such a coward.</i>

1259
01:37:34,950 --> 01:37:38,122
Look after the others, Danzo.
I know you'll—

1260
01:37:38,147 --> 01:37:41,233
Shut up! I was planning on volunteering!

1261
01:37:41,559 --> 01:37:45,039
Don't try to steal the spotlight!
I'll be the decoy!

1262
01:37:45,609 --> 01:37:46,610
Danzo…

1263
01:37:47,139 --> 01:37:50,434
My father and grandfather both died
on the battlefield as shinobi.

1264
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:52,792
Self-sacrifice is a shinobi's duty!

1265
01:37:53,492 --> 01:37:55,703
No, I will go and be the decoy, of course.

1266
01:37:56,385 --> 01:37:58,986
You all are the young Wills of Fire that

1267
01:37:59,011 --> 01:38:00,763
will be defending our village
in the future.

1268
01:38:00,998 --> 01:38:03,501
No! You are the Hokage!

1269
01:38:04,084 --> 01:38:06,253
There is no greater shinobi in
the village than you!

1270
01:38:07,105 --> 01:38:11,693
Danzo, you are always competing
with Saru over one thing or another,

1271
01:38:12,428 --> 01:38:14,760
but what's necessary here

1272
01:38:14,785 --> 01:38:16,494
is for you to unite and work together
as comrades.

1273
01:38:16,697 --> 01:38:18,365
Do not make this a personal fight.

1274
01:38:20,019 --> 01:38:22,396
The fact is, you took too long
to reach a decision.

1275
01:38:23,063 --> 01:38:27,735
You must first look at yourself rationally
and know yourself.

1276
01:38:28,351 --> 01:38:31,480
Otherwise, at this rate,
you will place your comrades in danger.

1277
01:38:32,398 --> 01:38:34,484
In any case, Danzo and Saru…

1278
01:38:35,261 --> 01:38:37,180
You two are still young,
so don't be hasty.

1279
01:38:37,849 --> 01:38:39,476
Your time will come.

1280
01:38:40,079 --> 01:38:43,123
Until that time, stay alive.

1281
01:38:46,894 --> 01:38:47,895
Saru…

1282
01:38:50,848 --> 01:38:54,185
Protect those who love the village
and those who believe in you.

1283
01:38:54,668 --> 01:38:59,172
And nurture those to whom
you can entrust the next generation.

1284
01:39:01,226 --> 01:39:03,270
Starting tomorrow, you are the Hokage!

1285
01:39:10,643 --> 01:39:13,563
Saru...Take care of the Hidden Leaf!

1286
01:39:14,064 --> 01:39:15,065
Yes, sir!

1287
01:39:17,661 --> 01:39:21,665
<i>You always get ahead of me!</i>

1288
01:39:29,034 --> 01:39:31,536
For the sake of the ninja world…
for sake of the Hidden Leaf…

1289
01:39:31,966 --> 01:39:34,760
I will not let you both live!

1290
01:39:38,185 --> 01:39:39,978
<i>This is the Reverse Tetragram
Sealing Jutsu.</i>

1291
01:39:40,821 --> 01:39:41,822
Sasuke!

1292
01:39:42,187 --> 01:39:43,438
Get away from Danzo!

1293
01:39:48,169 --> 01:39:52,799
<i>Hiruzen, it's my turn next.</i>

1294
01:39:54,329 --> 01:40:00,210
<i>Just as you gave your life to
protect the Hidden Leaf.</i>

1295
01:40:04,955 --> 01:40:06,748
<i>This time, I will.</i>

1296
01:40:08,711 --> 01:40:10,546
<i>I cannot allow these men…</i>

1297
01:40:12,736 --> 01:40:17,157
<i>But in the end,
I could not become the Hokage.</i>

1298
01:40:18,879 --> 01:40:24,593
<i>No matter how far I ran,
I could never catch up to you.</i>

1299
01:40:56,745 --> 01:41:00,416
<i>You were a tree leaf
upon which light shone.</i>

1300
01:41:01,055 --> 01:41:03,557
<i>I was nothing but a foundation
hidden in darkness.</i>

1301
01:41:05,109 --> 01:41:07,946
<i>What do you think of someone like me?</i>

1302
01:41:10,172 --> 01:41:11,507
<i>Hiruzen…</i>

1303
01:41:13,759 --> 01:41:17,387
<i>What was I to you?</i>

1304
01:41:23,035 --> 01:41:25,384
That was the Collateral Damage
Sealing Jutsu.

1305
01:41:25,409 --> 01:41:28,996
He would've dragged you into
his corpse and sealed you inside.

1306
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:33,837
He probably set it up to activate
at the moment of his death.

1307
01:41:41,637 --> 01:41:42,971
That was close.

1308
01:41:44,328 --> 01:41:47,373
We'll head for Hidden Leaf Village next.

1309
01:41:48,227 --> 01:41:49,645
The Hidden Leaf, huh?

1310
01:41:56,221 --> 01:41:58,432
I'm taking his eye.

1311
01:41:59,181 --> 01:42:03,435
Sasuke, don't be hasty.
Go back to the hideout and rest.

1312
01:42:04,670 --> 01:42:06,547
You used up too much of
your visual prowess.

1313
01:42:07,273 --> 01:42:09,567
Eventually you won't be
able to keep it up.

1314
01:42:11,317 --> 01:42:13,861
Your eye is losing its light.

1315
01:42:14,208 --> 01:42:16,168
What can you do by yourself now?

1316
01:42:17,414 --> 01:42:21,418
Patience is necessary
to reach one's goal.

1317
01:42:29,395 --> 01:42:30,188
Sakura…

1318
01:42:30,519 --> 01:42:31,520
What is it?

1319
01:42:31,983 --> 01:42:35,278
Perhaps it would have been
better to tell Naruto the truth.

1320
01:42:36,024 --> 01:42:37,818
There's no way
I could have told him.

1321
01:42:38,485 --> 01:42:39,653
Absolutely no way.

1322
01:42:40,195 --> 01:42:41,321
Sakura…

1323
01:42:41,853 --> 01:42:43,772
You're underestimating Naruto.

1324
01:42:45,328 --> 01:42:46,621
I found Sasuke.

1325
01:42:47,369 --> 01:42:49,580
That Tobi guy is next to him.

1326
01:42:49,913 --> 01:42:51,290
Stop, everyone!

1327
01:42:55,627 --> 01:42:57,754
What's wrong? Why did you stop?

1328
01:42:58,255 --> 01:43:00,174
We already went over our formation.

1329
01:43:00,266 --> 01:43:04,228
Kiba...What is Sasuke's precise location?

1330
01:43:05,137 --> 01:43:07,681
Facing directly north,
he's at 2 o'clock.

1331
01:43:07,817 --> 01:43:09,193
Up one kilometer.

1332
01:43:09,892 --> 01:43:10,893
Okay.

1333
01:43:11,185 --> 01:43:12,269
<i>Forgive me, everyone!</i>

1334
01:43:14,394 --> 01:43:15,699
I knew it.

1335
01:43:15,865 --> 01:43:17,958
You were going to use this to make
everyone fall asleep, weren't you?

1336
01:43:17,983 --> 01:43:18,942
Sai!

1337
01:43:19,422 --> 01:43:20,423
Huh?!

1338
01:43:21,528 --> 01:43:25,365
Sakura was going to take care
of Sasuke herself.

1339
01:43:26,867 --> 01:43:28,827
Why would you go alone?

1340
01:43:29,077 --> 01:43:32,414
Yes, why?
We promised to do it together!

1341
01:43:33,081 --> 01:43:35,334
No, you can't.

1342
01:43:35,876 --> 01:43:37,586
I won't let anyone proceed.

1343
01:43:38,796 --> 01:43:43,175
The four of us alone are no match
against Sasuke or this Tobi.

1344
01:43:44,802 --> 01:43:47,738
I promised Kakashi Sensei that
I wouldn't let any of you go.

1345
01:43:47,763 --> 01:43:48,764
What?

1346
01:43:48,968 --> 01:43:50,553
Is that the reason?

1347
01:43:51,016 --> 01:43:52,017
Sai…

1348
01:43:52,351 --> 01:43:53,685
I'll say this only once.

1349
01:43:55,896 --> 01:43:57,105
Move aside.

1350
01:43:59,066 --> 01:44:00,067
We must hurry.

1351
01:44:01,068 --> 01:44:02,569
It's becoming
a rather dire situation.

1352
01:44:04,238 --> 01:44:06,573
<i>Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll!</i>

1353
01:44:09,785 --> 01:44:11,995
You're going to bind us
with those snakes?

1354
01:44:12,428 --> 01:44:15,098
I understand where
Kakashi Sensei's coming from,

1355
01:44:15,123 --> 01:44:18,168
but we just can't keep
letting Sasuke go.

1356
01:44:18,752 --> 01:44:20,295
I'll take care of him!

1357
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:25,651
Why not, Akamaru?!
Don't be so scared!

1358
01:44:26,430 --> 01:44:28,051
The dog is smarter.

1359
01:44:29,054 --> 01:44:31,181
It seems he understands
what I'm saying.

1360
01:44:31,556 --> 01:44:32,557
Shut up!

1361
01:44:32,641 --> 01:44:33,767
Let's go, Lee.

1362
01:44:33,809 --> 01:44:35,727
Sure thing! Yeah!

1363
01:44:38,689 --> 01:44:40,440
I'll take care of this
with Tunneling Fang!

1364
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:41,984
Good diversion, Kiba!

1365
01:44:42,234 --> 01:44:43,235
Here!

1366
01:44:46,738 --> 01:44:47,739
<i>Damn it!</i>

1367
01:44:54,705 --> 01:44:56,873
I'm sorry…everyone.

1368
01:44:57,219 --> 01:44:59,096
She got us. Please hurry!

1369
01:45:02,963 --> 01:45:04,298
I'm impressed, Sakura.

1370
01:45:09,469 --> 01:45:13,307
Naruto, let's go soon.
Are you still not ready?

1371
01:45:14,008 --> 01:45:16,594
I don't feel like going outside yet.

1372
01:45:17,894 --> 01:45:19,146
Can you wait a bit longer?

1373
01:45:21,398 --> 01:45:25,235
<i>All right. He still hasn't caught on
that I'm a Shadow Clone.</i>

1374
01:45:45,997 --> 01:45:47,123
Sasuke…

1375
01:45:47,674 --> 01:45:49,634
I'm going to give you a bit of advice.

1376
01:45:51,522 --> 01:45:52,982
That woman…

1377
01:45:54,756 --> 01:45:57,467
If you don't need her,
make sure you finish her off.

1378
01:45:57,601 --> 01:45:59,936
She knows too much about us.

1379
01:46:00,228 --> 01:46:04,232
"Us"? When did I join you?

1380
01:46:05,859 --> 01:46:07,027
Well, nevermind.

1381
01:46:07,725 --> 01:46:08,726
We'll meet again.

1382
01:46:38,141 --> 01:46:39,267
No!

1383
01:46:39,810 --> 01:46:40,811
Karin…

1384
01:46:41,228 --> 01:46:43,105
You said you didn't feel well.

1385
01:46:43,833 --> 01:46:44,918
Hurry up!

1386
01:46:45,254 --> 01:46:46,721
We have to help out.

1387
01:46:46,746 --> 01:46:48,998
It's the requirement for us
being allowed to stay here.

1388
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:50,201
But!

1389
01:46:50,445 --> 01:46:51,863
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

1390
01:46:52,038 --> 01:46:52,923
<i>No!</i>

1391
01:46:52,948 --> 01:46:54,491
<i>Be a good girl.</i>

1392
01:46:54,533 --> 01:46:55,575
<i>Mom!</i>

1393
01:46:57,436 --> 01:46:58,813
Mom!

1394
01:47:00,914 --> 01:47:01,957
Mom…

1395
01:47:12,925 --> 01:47:13,926
Stand up.

1396
01:47:16,054 --> 01:47:17,097
Where are we?

1397
01:47:17,472 --> 01:47:20,892
We took huge losses
from a surprise attack.

1398
01:47:21,813 --> 01:47:24,149
The village is overflowing
with the wounded.

1399
01:47:25,268 --> 01:47:27,728
We won't make it with
just your mother.

1400
01:47:33,908 --> 01:47:34,909
<i>Mom?!</i>

1401
01:47:52,156 --> 01:47:53,282
Let me go!

1402
01:47:53,592 --> 01:47:54,843
My mom…!

1403
01:47:55,189 --> 01:47:56,648
My mom is—!

1404
01:47:56,678 --> 01:47:59,556
There was no other choice
in order to protect the village!

1405
01:47:59,556 --> 01:48:00,557
What—?!

1406
01:48:00,804 --> 01:48:03,182
It's unfortunate that
you lost your mother,

1407
01:48:03,727 --> 01:48:05,562
but we still have more wounded.

1408
01:48:16,265 --> 01:48:17,266
You're late!

1409
01:48:17,930 --> 01:48:18,973
Where's that woman?

1410
01:48:19,238 --> 01:48:20,239
She's dead.

1411
01:48:20,619 --> 01:48:22,454
She's going to take over
from today.

1412
01:48:22,597 --> 01:48:23,578
Huh?!

1413
01:48:23,603 --> 01:48:25,939
This child? Can she handle it?

1414
01:48:26,435 --> 01:48:27,936
She is that woman's daughter.

1415
01:48:28,307 --> 01:48:29,933
She has the same ability.

1416
01:48:30,258 --> 01:48:30,979
No!

1417
01:48:31,004 --> 01:48:32,005
Let me go!

1418
01:48:32,030 --> 01:48:33,114
No!

1419
01:48:33,712 --> 01:48:36,343
We're letting you stay because
you have nowhere else to go.

1420
01:48:36,674 --> 01:48:39,093
Work enough to earn your stay!

1421
01:48:39,998 --> 01:48:41,135
It hurts!

1422
01:48:42,034 --> 01:48:44,605
Damn it! It hurts!

1423
01:48:44,768 --> 01:48:45,769
Don't worry!

1424
01:48:45,843 --> 01:48:47,266
We'll heal you in no time.

1425
01:48:47,661 --> 01:48:48,407
No!

1426
01:48:49,116 --> 01:48:50,326
Now go on, bite!

1427
01:48:55,913 --> 01:48:58,082
Please…stop.

1428
01:49:06,278 --> 01:49:08,781
We took your mother
to your house.

1429
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:12,133
From tomorrow,

1430
01:49:12,158 --> 01:49:14,869
go to the hospital even
if no one comes to get you.

1431
01:49:44,077 --> 01:49:46,246
Over there! Send more chakra!

1432
01:49:46,792 --> 01:49:48,335
Forget him! It's too late.

1433
01:49:48,582 --> 01:49:49,833
Check the one next to him.

1434
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:52,002
Don't dawdle! Come with me!

1435
01:49:52,626 --> 01:49:54,085
That one can be treated
with medicine.

1436
01:49:54,379 --> 01:49:56,006
Continue just like that.

1437
01:49:59,384 --> 01:50:00,468
Now this one!

1438
01:50:00,723 --> 01:50:01,724
Hurry and come with me!

1439
01:50:05,947 --> 01:50:07,407
Hey, you have work to do!

1440
01:50:16,026 --> 01:50:17,360
Don't stop here!

1441
01:50:18,153 --> 01:50:19,988
But I've never been
on a battlefield…

1442
01:50:20,327 --> 01:50:21,161
Shut up!

1443
01:50:21,290 --> 01:50:24,251
If you can't run, I'll kill you.

1444
01:50:26,661 --> 01:50:27,662
Stand!

1445
01:50:46,097 --> 01:50:47,098
Go.

1446
01:50:47,140 --> 01:50:48,141
Come on!

1447
01:50:55,482 --> 01:50:56,483
<i>Mom…</i>

1448
01:51:00,045 --> 01:51:03,131
The higher-ups have decided
to let you take part

1449
01:51:03,156 --> 01:51:05,659
in the next Chunin Exams.

1450
01:51:05,895 --> 01:51:06,605
Me?

1451
01:51:06,884 --> 01:51:09,512
This exam displays the strength

1452
01:51:09,537 --> 01:51:12,957
of each ninja Village through
their genin's abilities.

1453
01:51:13,790 --> 01:51:15,620
It's considered a war by proxy.

1454
01:51:16,544 --> 01:51:18,963
We cannot afford to lose.

1455
01:51:20,145 --> 01:51:23,231
Your duty is to keep the other two
completely replenished.

1456
01:51:24,125 --> 01:51:25,960
We took in an outsider like you…

1457
01:51:26,611 --> 01:51:29,864
Keep that in mind and make sure
you get us good results.

1458
01:51:30,988 --> 01:51:31,644
Yes.

1459
01:51:34,637 --> 01:51:35,968
Oh yeah.
I have to keep hiding.

1460
01:51:52,660 --> 01:51:53,786
<i>Lions Barrage!</i>

1461
01:52:08,857 --> 01:52:10,775
The Earth Scroll…same as us.

1462
01:52:18,341 --> 01:52:20,260
<i>M-My glasses!</i>

1463
01:52:29,300 --> 01:52:30,760
– Later.
– Later.

1464
01:52:33,021 --> 01:52:36,399
<i>I wish I could've seen your face
from back then,</i>

1465
01:52:36,883 --> 01:52:38,009
<i>just one more time.</i>

1466
01:52:53,475 --> 01:52:54,517
Sasuke!

1467
01:53:02,901 --> 01:53:04,277
It's you, Sakura.

1468
01:53:05,320 --> 01:53:08,531
<i>He feels totally different.</i>

1469
01:53:09,115 --> 01:53:10,658
<i>Is this really Sasuke?</i>

1470
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:14,370
What are you doing here?

1471
01:53:16,831 --> 01:53:18,166
<i>Who is she?</i>

1472
01:53:19,375 --> 01:53:22,712
I'm coming with you!
I'm deserting the Hidden Leaf!

1473
01:53:33,389 --> 01:53:35,016
That Danzo…

1474
01:53:35,433 --> 01:53:38,269
He destroyed Shisui's eye
before he died.

1475
01:53:44,901 --> 01:53:48,279
What's in it for me if
you come along?

1476
01:53:49,169 --> 01:53:50,754
What are you plotting?

1477
01:53:51,064 --> 01:53:52,691
I'm not plotting anything!

1478
01:53:53,175 --> 01:53:55,845
Ever since you left
the Hidden Leaf Village,

1479
01:53:55,870 --> 01:53:59,666
I've regretted not going with you!

1480
01:54:01,719 --> 01:54:04,580
<i>Is she an old teammate?</i>

1481
01:54:05,750 --> 01:54:09,378
<i>And she's also in love
with Sasuke? But…</i>

1482
01:54:12,415 --> 01:54:14,302
I'll do whatever you want.

1483
01:54:14,705 --> 01:54:16,248
I don't want to have any more regrets.

1484
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:19,310
And do you know what I want?

1485
01:54:19,744 --> 01:54:23,122
I don't care!
I'll do whatever you ask.

1486
01:54:23,147 --> 01:54:24,649
I'm going to destroy the Hidden Leaf!

1487
01:54:25,567 --> 01:54:27,360
That's what I want!

1488
01:54:28,512 --> 01:54:32,516
Will you really be able betray
the Hidden Leaf for me?

1489
01:54:33,009 --> 01:54:36,638
Yes. If you asked me to.

1490
01:54:37,460 --> 01:54:40,342
Then prove it.

1491
01:54:41,459 --> 01:54:43,127
Finish her off.

1492
01:54:44,205 --> 01:54:46,499
Then I'll believe you.

1493
01:54:52,218 --> 01:54:53,219
Who is she?

1494
01:54:53,970 --> 01:54:56,598
A member of the group,
Taka, which I founded.

1495
01:54:57,015 --> 01:54:59,685
As you can see, she's useless.

1496
01:55:00,018 --> 01:55:02,979
Sakura, you're a medical ninja, right?

1497
01:55:03,873 --> 01:55:06,792
You can replace her.
This will work out just fine.

1498
01:55:07,984 --> 01:55:12,071
<i>How could he?
He's definitely not the old Sasuke.</i>

1499
01:55:13,197 --> 01:55:14,949
<i>He's completely changed.</i>

1500
01:55:27,420 --> 01:55:30,924
Well, Sakura? You can't do it?

1501
01:55:32,525 --> 01:55:34,652
<i>She has nothing to do with this.</i>

1502
01:55:35,158 --> 01:55:40,163
<i>If I...If I stab Sasuke now…</i>

1503
01:55:40,849 --> 01:55:42,225
<i>It will all be over.</i>

1504
01:55:42,797 --> 01:55:45,675
Stop, Sasuke.

1505
01:55:52,028 --> 01:55:53,488
<i>He really meant to kill her.</i>

1506
01:55:53,904 --> 01:55:55,488
How you've fallen, Sasuke.

1507
01:56:02,288 --> 01:56:03,957
One after another.

1508
01:56:04,285 --> 01:56:08,289
Sakura, you tried to kill Sasuke
by yourself, didn't you?

1509
01:56:10,371 --> 01:56:13,416
You don't have to shoulder
such a heavy burden by yourself.

1510
01:56:14,128 --> 01:56:16,547
I was the leader of Team 7.

1511
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:20,807
It was my cowardice that
split all of you up.

1512
01:56:21,432 --> 01:56:22,517
Sakura…

1513
01:56:22,850 --> 01:56:24,686
I said something irresponsible to you

1514
01:56:24,711 --> 01:56:26,088
in an effort to put you at ease.

1515
01:56:29,941 --> 01:56:31,526
<i>Kakashi Sensei…</i>

1516
01:56:33,861 --> 01:56:37,115
<i>Don't worry.
It will be like it was before!</i>

1517
01:56:38,282 --> 01:56:41,285
I must have been trying to
convince myself of that too.

1518
01:56:41,844 --> 01:56:43,638
I'm sorry I'm such
a careless Sensei.

1519
01:56:44,580 --> 01:56:45,707
But you're…

1520
01:56:47,792 --> 01:56:48,918
Sasuke…

1521
01:56:49,730 --> 01:56:52,733
I don't like to repeat myself.

1522
01:56:53,423 --> 01:56:56,259
But I'll say this once more.

1523
01:57:04,787 --> 01:57:08,165
<i>I've seen so many guys
like you, I've lost count.</i>

1524
01:57:08,813 --> 01:57:12,150
<i>Those who follow the path
of revenge end up nowhere.</i>

1525
01:57:13,401 --> 01:57:15,862
Do not become possessed
by vengeance!

1526
01:57:27,457 --> 01:57:31,586
Itachi...My father...My mother…

1527
01:57:32,082 --> 01:57:34,543
My entire clan!
Bring them all here!

1528
01:57:34,714 --> 01:57:36,758
Do that and I'll quit right now!

1529
01:57:37,517 --> 01:57:39,102
I don't want to kill you.

1530
01:57:39,719 --> 01:57:42,555
You talk like you could kill me
at any time!

1531
01:57:43,437 --> 01:57:45,857
Stop acting like
you're still my Sensei.

1532
01:57:46,591 --> 01:57:50,261
I'm itching to kill you…

1533
01:57:50,563 --> 01:57:51,564
Kakashi.

1534
01:57:52,610 --> 01:57:54,779
<i>He's been completely twisted
by Madara.</i>

1535
01:57:55,468 --> 01:57:59,389
Sakura...Heal that girl to the point
that she can speak.

1536
01:57:59,741 --> 01:58:01,243
We still have time right now.

1537
01:58:01,684 --> 01:58:04,144
She knows a lot of intel
about the enemy.

1538
01:58:05,203 --> 01:58:06,204
What about you, Sensei?

1539
01:58:06,788 --> 01:58:09,540
I will take on what would
have been your burden.

1540
01:58:10,632 --> 01:58:13,218
I guess you could say
it's my responsibility.

1541
01:58:14,420 --> 01:58:15,421
All right?

1542
01:58:17,394 --> 01:58:18,896
Hurry and go, Sakura.

1543
01:58:26,599 --> 01:58:28,650
<i>No matter how far he had fallen,</i>

1544
01:58:28,675 --> 01:58:31,386
<i>he was still dear to you, wasn't he?</i>

1545
01:58:32,277 --> 01:58:33,570
<i>Third Hokage…</i>

1546
01:58:33,934 --> 01:58:36,461
<i>Even though you had nurtured
many other fine pupils…</i>

1547
01:58:39,888 --> 01:58:42,224
<i>A cherished student
abandons the village.</i>

1548
01:58:44,992 --> 01:58:48,621
<i>The agony of having to face
that dear student in battle.</i>

1549
01:58:50,221 --> 01:58:53,599
<i>No one can begin to imagine
the resolve it took.</i>

1550
01:59:01,259 --> 01:59:06,806
Now I finally understand how
the Third Hokage must have felt.

1551
01:59:08,939 --> 01:59:13,027
You will go the same way
as the Third Hokage!

1552
01:59:14,300 --> 01:59:15,268
You…

1553
01:59:15,648 --> 01:59:19,068
Don't talk yet! Just a little longer.

1554
01:59:20,637 --> 01:59:24,907
<i>You're the enemy,
I don't want to know how you feel.</i>

1555
01:59:25,910 --> 01:59:28,498
<i>So…stop crying in front of me…</i>

1556
01:59:29,954 --> 01:59:33,124
<i>With such a sad face!</i>

1557
01:59:35,209 --> 01:59:39,130
The Sharingan is proof of
being an Uchiha.

1558
01:59:39,672 --> 01:59:42,508
A lowlife ninja who isn't an Uchiha…

1559
01:59:43,329 --> 01:59:45,539
Has no right showing off that eye!

1560
01:59:48,577 --> 01:59:50,245
<i>Earth Style: Mud Wall!</i>

1561
02:00:06,365 --> 02:00:11,662
For someone whose Sharingan is
borrowed, you're quite skilled in using it.

1562
02:00:12,246 --> 02:00:16,000
However, can your Sharingan do this?

1563
02:00:16,721 --> 02:00:18,783
I will show you…

1564
02:00:18,808 --> 02:00:21,311
That my Sharingan is in
a completely different class than yours!

1565
02:00:38,314 --> 02:00:39,398
This is…

1566
02:00:56,916 --> 02:00:58,042
<i>So fast.</i>

1567
02:00:58,251 --> 02:01:01,420
<i>If I hadn't blown it away with the
Mangekyo, I'd be dead right now.</i>

1568
02:01:01,980 --> 02:01:07,176
To think that someone who's not an
Uchiha could awaken the Mangekyo.

1569
02:01:08,010 --> 02:01:12,473
So it seems that eye's power
saved you.

1570
02:01:13,380 --> 02:01:15,882
You should be grateful to
the power of the Uchiha.

1571
02:01:16,262 --> 02:01:17,263
Sasuke…

1572
02:01:17,580 --> 02:01:22,377
You are more than just your clan.
More than just hatred.

1573
02:01:23,025 --> 02:01:26,529
Look deep inside your heart.
One more time.

1574
02:01:27,489 --> 02:01:29,574
Are you still going on about that?

1575
02:01:30,929 --> 02:01:33,098
Deep down, you know.

1576
02:01:38,736 --> 02:01:40,696
They're all laughing.

1577
02:01:42,001 --> 02:01:44,753
You're laughing at
the cost of Itachi's life!

1578
02:01:45,089 --> 02:01:48,551
Laughing together,
completely ignorant of everything!

1579
02:01:56,524 --> 02:02:01,679
Your laughing voices sound like
contempt and mocking to me now!

1580
02:02:01,981 --> 02:02:05,359
I will change those laughs
to screams and wails!

1581
02:02:18,566 --> 02:02:19,567
Damn it!

1582
02:02:28,466 --> 02:02:29,465
<i>My sight!</i>

1583
02:02:40,721 --> 02:02:43,432
What is she going to do?

1584
02:02:51,864 --> 02:02:54,283
<i>Sakura! Why are you here?</i>

1585
02:02:56,702 --> 02:02:57,704
Don't!

1586
02:02:57,729 --> 02:03:00,481
<i>I won't let Kakashi Sensei
bear the burden!</i>

1587
02:03:05,711 --> 02:03:06,920
<i>Sakura…</i>

1588
02:03:08,962 --> 02:03:10,171
<i>Thank you.</i>

1589
02:03:13,047 --> 02:03:15,258
<i>I was sure…I was prepared.</i>

1590
02:03:16,667 --> 02:03:17,918
Sakura!

1591
02:03:18,893 --> 02:03:19,935
<i>Damn it!</i>

1592
02:03:20,014 --> 02:03:22,350
<i>This always happens right after
I use the Mangekyo!</i>

1593
02:03:26,440 --> 02:03:28,025
Stop, Sasuke!

1594
02:04:12,445 --> 02:04:14,780
Your timing is better
than mine, Naruto.

1595
02:04:15,239 --> 02:04:19,785
I never imagined you coming here.
You're a lifesaver!

1596
02:04:20,741 --> 02:04:23,202
Th-Thank you, Naruto.

1597
02:04:27,585 --> 02:04:29,336
Sasuke…

1598
02:04:29,378 --> 02:04:32,506
Sakura is a fellow ninja
from Team 7.

1599
02:04:32,715 --> 02:04:37,344
"Was" a fellow ninja.
I no longer belong.

1600
02:04:38,127 --> 02:04:41,297
Now do you understand,
Naruto, Sakura?

1601
02:04:41,986 --> 02:04:44,739
His intent to kill is real.

1602
02:04:45,478 --> 02:04:49,064
Sasuke is no longer
the same person as before.

1603
02:04:54,253 --> 02:04:55,712
Sasuke…

1604
02:04:56,263 --> 02:04:57,514
What?

1605
02:04:58,433 --> 02:05:02,770
I heard the truth about Itachi
from a guy named Tobi.

1606
02:05:05,623 --> 02:05:07,750
<i>The truth about Itachi?</i>

1607
02:05:08,741 --> 02:05:13,955
I don't know for sure
if what he said is really true or not.

1608
02:05:14,608 --> 02:05:16,527
But it doesn't matter.

1609
02:05:16,658 --> 02:05:19,369
What you've been doing is…

1610
02:05:19,722 --> 02:05:21,026
Understandable.

1611
02:05:29,981 --> 02:05:33,985
Naruto...I told you before.

1612
02:05:34,952 --> 02:05:39,373
You don't have parents or siblings,
so you couldn't possibly understand me.

1613
02:05:41,540 --> 02:05:43,417
So outsiders can keep
their mouths shut!

1614
02:05:45,371 --> 02:05:47,998
Do you know what Naruto
has gone through for you?

1615
02:05:48,642 --> 02:05:50,935
No matter what rumors
we hear about you,

1616
02:05:51,021 --> 02:05:53,023
he never stops thinking
of you as a friend.

1617
02:05:53,963 --> 02:05:56,507
While everyone targeted you,

1618
02:05:56,549 --> 02:06:00,469
Naruto alone tried to rescue you!

1619
02:06:00,719 --> 02:06:02,054
Even now…

1620
02:06:02,972 --> 02:06:07,268
Rescue me? From what?

1621
02:06:08,269 --> 02:06:09,603
Well, from…

1622
02:06:10,929 --> 02:06:12,555
From revenge.

1623
02:06:15,121 --> 02:06:20,627
I swear I'll save you from
the chaos of vengeance.

1624
02:06:22,616 --> 02:06:24,535
There's no need for that.

1625
02:06:25,168 --> 02:06:28,380
The stage has already been set
for my vengeance to happen!

1626
02:06:29,832 --> 02:06:33,127
I killed a high-ranking elder
of the Hidden Leaf.

1627
02:06:33,855 --> 02:06:35,732
Someone named Danzo.

1628
02:06:37,881 --> 02:06:41,969
<i>Sasuke killed Danzo all by himself?</i>

1629
02:06:43,178 --> 02:06:45,598
I've never felt like this before.

1630
02:06:46,101 --> 02:06:49,771
I feel the tainted Uchiha name
becoming cleansed.

1631
02:06:49,796 --> 02:06:54,342
I feel the Uchiha getting free
from this rotting ninja world.

1632
02:06:54,658 --> 02:06:56,994
You guys couldn't begin
to understand.

1633
02:06:58,569 --> 02:07:04,116
And isn't what I'm doing exactly
what you Leaf ninja wanted all along?

1634
02:07:04,480 --> 02:07:08,151
You've always snubbed and
put down the Uchiha.

1635
02:07:08,683 --> 02:07:11,937
So I'll help erase the Uchiha
from your memories.

1636
02:07:12,225 --> 02:07:16,688
I'm going to kill all of you,

1637
02:07:16,713 --> 02:07:18,923
and destroy the Hidden Leaf!

1638
02:07:22,556 --> 02:07:26,919
Severing all bonds to the Hidden
Leaf is the ultimate purification!

1639
02:07:27,239 --> 02:07:30,951
And that shall lead to
the Uchiha's true restoration!

1640
02:07:32,251 --> 02:07:33,585
Sasuke…

1641
02:07:34,351 --> 02:07:37,646
<i>Hatred. The history of repeated
accumulating hatred.</i>

1642
02:07:38,203 --> 02:07:40,622
<i>That is what created
the Sasuke in front of us.</i>

1643
02:07:42,069 --> 02:07:44,438
<i>Though they may not realize it,</i>

1644
02:07:45,007 --> 02:07:47,042
<i>Naruto and Sakura are
seeing with their own eyes</i>

1645
02:07:47,067 --> 02:07:49,778
<i>that Sasuke is a victim
of the times we live in.</i>

1646
02:07:51,580 --> 02:07:52,998
<i>And that is why…</i>

1647
02:08:14,666 --> 02:08:16,709
This is my task.

1648
02:08:17,148 --> 02:08:18,858
But Kakashi Sensei…

1649
02:08:19,274 --> 02:08:22,403
If you stay, you'll see things
you do not want to see.

1650
02:08:22,843 --> 02:08:23,734
Now go!

1651
02:08:24,238 --> 02:08:25,322
I…

1652
02:08:25,666 --> 02:08:29,856
Sakura, the poison-laced kunai
Shizune taught you how to use

1653
02:08:30,038 --> 02:08:31,347
won't kill Sasuke.

1654
02:08:31,870 --> 02:08:34,039
Orochimaru gave him
resistance to poisons.

1655
02:08:34,731 --> 02:08:37,942
What's more...You've come to terms
with your feelings, right?

1656
02:08:43,910 --> 02:08:48,444
Sasuke...I healed you.

1657
02:08:48,595 --> 02:08:53,684
But your body cannot…
withstand another battle.

1658
02:08:54,727 --> 02:08:59,314
<i>No...I don't care about
Sasuke anymore.</i>

1659
02:09:06,244 --> 02:09:10,058
Kakashi Sensei,
this "something" I don't want to see…

1660
02:09:10,083 --> 02:09:12,043
Are you going to kill Sasuke?

1661
02:09:14,371 --> 02:09:15,789
Go! Both of you!

1662
02:09:22,467 --> 02:09:24,844
Now's my chance!
I'm not holding back!

1663
02:09:25,215 --> 02:09:26,550
Wait, Naruto!

1664
02:09:36,643 --> 02:09:39,021
<i>There's a chance, Sasuke…</i>

1665
02:09:40,063 --> 02:09:42,441
<i>That our roles…</i>

1666
02:09:46,028 --> 02:09:48,489
<i>Could have been reversed.</i>

1667
02:09:53,035 --> 02:09:54,745
– <i>Chidori!</i>
– <i>Rasengan!</i>

1668
02:10:24,403 --> 02:10:27,740
Sasuke...You remember, right?

1669
02:10:28,278 --> 02:10:32,157
The entire village used
to despise me.

1670
02:10:33,395 --> 02:10:37,191
It's because I have
the Nine-Tails inside me.

1671
02:10:38,475 --> 02:10:41,061
At one time, I hated the village too.

1672
02:10:43,362 --> 02:10:45,906
I even thought about revenge.

1673
02:10:46,964 --> 02:10:48,916
One step in the wrong direction

1674
02:10:48,941 --> 02:10:51,986
and I might have conjured up
some terrible plan just like you.

1675
02:10:55,597 --> 02:10:57,933
I almost gave in to despair.

1676
02:10:58,308 --> 02:11:01,703
But you and Iruka Sensei saved me.

1677
02:11:03,814 --> 02:11:07,359
I knew that you were always alone.

1678
02:11:07,763 --> 02:11:12,810
Watching you, I felt reassured
that I wasn't the only one.

1679
02:11:13,490 --> 02:11:17,578
We were both kids,
and looking back…

1680
02:11:17,847 --> 02:11:21,476
I had to live with the Nine-Tails
and you, the fate of the Uchiha.

1681
02:11:22,332 --> 02:11:25,794
It's ironic that
we had similar burdens.

1682
02:11:28,171 --> 02:11:31,216
To be honest,
every time I saw you,

1683
02:11:31,475 --> 02:11:34,478
I wanted to walk over
and start talking.

1684
02:11:35,067 --> 02:11:37,615
I'd get sort of giddy.

1685
02:11:37,640 --> 02:11:40,643
Because I felt like you
understood me.

1686
02:11:41,768 --> 02:11:43,896
But I stopped.

1687
02:11:44,646 --> 02:11:46,398
The reason is because

1688
02:11:46,598 --> 02:11:49,351
I was jealous because
you were good at everything.

1689
02:11:49,608 --> 02:11:52,986
So I made you my rival.

1690
02:11:54,540 --> 02:11:55,869
You've been…

1691
02:12:00,829 --> 02:12:02,623
My goal.

1692
02:12:03,498 --> 02:12:08,293
I had nothing,
but I built bonds with Team 7.

1693
02:12:09,004 --> 02:12:11,739
With you and Sakura.

1694
02:12:25,437 --> 02:12:29,024
I wanted to be strong
and cool like you.

1695
02:12:29,983 --> 02:12:32,611
That's why I kept chasing
after you.

1696
02:12:37,143 --> 02:12:40,272
I'm really glad I met you.

1697
02:12:42,996 --> 02:12:44,373
Naruto…

1698
02:12:44,831 --> 02:12:48,460
You can't change me,
no matter what you say to me now.

1699
02:12:50,837 --> 02:12:53,924
I'm going to kill
each and every person in the Leaf,

1700
02:12:53,966 --> 02:12:55,717
including you!

1701
02:13:00,013 --> 02:13:02,808
And I'll get revenge for
the Uchiha Clan!

1702
02:13:04,757 --> 02:13:08,142
Is that really the only way?

1703
02:13:08,556 --> 02:13:09,724
Yes.

1704
02:13:10,941 --> 02:13:13,923
So your only choices are
to kill me and

1705
02:13:13,948 --> 02:13:16,909
become the hero who
saved the village,

1706
02:13:17,277 --> 02:13:19,902
or to be killed by me and
become known as just a loser!

1707
02:13:21,785 --> 02:13:23,203
Sasuke…

1708
02:13:23,889 --> 02:13:25,801
I don't believe that.

1709
02:13:28,959 --> 02:13:34,673
I'm not going to be the loser,
or the hero who killed you!

1710
02:13:35,382 --> 02:13:37,342
Neither one's gonna happen!

1711
02:13:42,139 --> 02:13:42,991
I…

1712
02:13:59,823 --> 02:14:00,843
Whoa!

1713
02:14:05,218 --> 02:14:06,150
You!

1714
02:14:07,785 --> 02:14:09,167
When did you—?

1715
02:14:09,304 --> 02:14:12,599
I've been tagging along
for quite a while.

1716
02:14:13,297 --> 02:14:18,068
Tobi told me to make sure
you didn't notice me.

1717
02:14:19,484 --> 02:14:22,570
But, since you were in a crisis…

1718
02:14:27,142 --> 02:14:30,020
<i>I should summon him soon.</i>

1719
02:14:30,270 --> 02:14:33,106
<i>It doesn't seem like
he's going to retreat quietly.</i>

1720
02:14:33,594 --> 02:14:34,466
Naruto…

1721
02:14:34,733 --> 02:14:36,485
I told you to go back
to the village.

1722
02:14:37,652 --> 02:14:38,785
Now…

1723
02:14:41,468 --> 02:14:42,660
It's all clear.

1724
02:14:48,086 --> 02:14:52,215
I'd better collect the Rinnegan
before the war begins.

1725
02:14:57,035 --> 02:15:01,331
Sasuke's in a bind.
What do you want to do?

1726
02:15:18,325 --> 02:15:20,285
What's going on, Sasuke?

1727
02:15:20,499 --> 02:15:22,709
I told you to go home and rest.

1728
02:15:24,783 --> 02:15:26,159
<i>Madara…</i>

1729
02:15:34,630 --> 02:15:36,049
The Nine-Tails, huh?

1730
02:15:37,486 --> 02:15:42,319
It seems you cannot suppress the
urge to fight when you two get together.

1731
02:15:43,376 --> 02:15:46,629
I'll arrange a proper place
for you to hunt the Nine-Tails.

1732
02:15:48,722 --> 02:15:50,349
For now, we retreat.

1733
02:15:53,201 --> 02:15:55,411
I'll fight in your stead.

1734
02:15:56,356 --> 02:16:00,735
Since we need the Nine-Tails
Jinchuriki anyway.

1735
02:16:02,362 --> 02:16:04,072
<i>Madara as well as Zetsu?</i>

1736
02:16:04,440 --> 02:16:06,150
<i>They're sticking close to Sasuke.</i>

1737
02:16:07,033 --> 02:16:10,162
<i>This is going to be tough
all by myself.</i>

1738
02:16:10,954 --> 02:16:12,205
<i>What should I do?</i>

1739
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:17,590
Zetsu...You can't capture Naruto.

1740
02:16:18,756 --> 02:16:21,467
The Nine-Tails will be too much
for a non-combat type like you.

1741
02:16:22,635 --> 02:16:24,762
I'm going to let Sasuke
get the Nine-Tails.

1742
02:16:25,342 --> 02:16:27,344
It's for my enjoyment as well.

1743
02:16:27,628 --> 02:16:29,880
Oh, is that so?

1744
02:16:30,307 --> 02:16:32,184
But I'm concerned about Kisame.

1745
02:16:32,521 --> 02:16:34,231
So go to him.

1746
02:16:35,126 --> 02:16:36,878
And rendezvous with Black Zetsu.

1747
02:16:36,938 --> 02:16:39,191
Okay, okay, I understand.

1748
02:16:42,710 --> 02:16:43,878
Naruto!

1749
02:16:45,989 --> 02:16:47,532
I'm all right.

1750
02:16:48,086 --> 02:16:51,756
But I need to make sure
I say something to Sasuke.

1751
02:16:54,066 --> 02:16:55,275
Let's go, Sasuke.

1752
02:16:55,457 --> 02:16:56,458
Wait.

1753
02:17:05,738 --> 02:17:08,616
Sasuke...Do you remember?

1754
02:17:09,804 --> 02:17:14,100
Do you remember what you said
to me long ago in the Final Valley?

1755
02:17:15,769 --> 02:17:18,230
The thing about high-level shinobi.

1756
02:17:18,995 --> 02:17:21,706
<i>When two shinobi are
of a high enough level,</i>

1757
02:17:21,731 --> 02:17:23,526
<i>they can read each other's thoughts</i>

1758
02:17:23,551 --> 02:17:25,637
<i>through no more than
a trade of blows.</i>

1759
02:17:26,050 --> 02:17:28,094
<i>They don't need to say a word.</i>

1760
02:17:29,248 --> 02:17:32,376
<i>You're naïve, Naruto.</i>

1761
02:17:35,163 --> 02:17:36,790
<i>So tell me…</i>

1762
02:17:37,082 --> 02:17:43,588
<i>Were you able to read what
was inside of my heart?</i>

1763
02:17:44,589 --> 02:17:46,591
Clashing face-to-face.

1764
02:17:46,675 --> 02:17:49,595
Just now, we learned things from
just trading blows with each other.

1765
02:17:50,011 --> 02:17:53,723
It means we've become
high-level shinobi.

1766
02:17:54,204 --> 02:17:55,956
You and me.

1767
02:17:57,686 --> 02:17:59,020
Sasuke…

1768
02:18:01,856 --> 02:18:06,319
Were you able to read…

1769
02:18:07,219 --> 02:18:10,056
What was inside of my heart?

1770
02:18:11,533 --> 02:18:14,077
And you saw it, didn't you?

1771
02:18:14,703 --> 02:18:16,955
That if you and I fight…

1772
02:18:20,044 --> 02:18:21,337
We will both die.

1773
02:18:23,586 --> 02:18:24,838
Sasuke…

1774
02:18:25,255 --> 02:18:29,718
If you attack the Hidden Leaf,
I will have to fight you.

1775
02:18:30,593 --> 02:18:32,595
Save your hatred until then.

1776
02:18:33,105 --> 02:18:36,024
At that time, throw all of
your hatred at me.

1777
02:18:36,891 --> 02:18:39,394
The only one who can
handle all that hatred…

1778
02:18:39,436 --> 02:18:40,770
Is me.

1779
02:18:41,943 --> 02:18:44,612
Only I can fulfill that duty!

1780
02:18:45,546 --> 02:18:46,700
And on that day,

1781
02:18:46,725 --> 02:18:50,451
I'll bear the burden of
your hate and die with you!

1782
02:18:56,518 --> 02:18:58,937
What is it with you, Naruto?

1783
02:19:00,206 --> 02:19:02,876
Just what the hell do you want?!

1784
02:19:02,917 --> 02:19:04,961
Why are you so fixated on me?!

1785
02:19:05,211 --> 02:19:06,755
Because you're my friend!

1786
02:19:18,567 --> 02:19:19,718
Sasuke…

1787
02:19:20,587 --> 02:19:24,189
I knew from the moment we first met
that it was going to take more

1788
02:19:24,841 --> 02:19:26,971
than just ordinary means
to understand you.

1789
02:19:29,263 --> 02:19:32,215
Exchanging fists is how
we understand each other.

1790
02:19:32,240 --> 02:19:33,658
That's for sure.

1791
02:19:35,173 --> 02:19:36,799
Like I said just now…

1792
02:19:37,211 --> 02:19:41,003
It means we've become
high-level shinobi.

1793
02:19:42,874 --> 02:19:45,835
<i>Once we understand each other,
your hatred will go away.</i>

1794
02:19:45,877 --> 02:19:49,047
<i>The same way that I changed
after meeting Iruka Sensei.</i>

1795
02:19:50,423 --> 02:19:52,425
I'm not giving up yet.

1796
02:19:52,877 --> 02:19:56,505
I'm taking you back
to Hidden Leaf Village!

1797
02:19:57,333 --> 02:19:59,877
That's something I'll never give up on!

1798
02:20:01,409 --> 02:20:04,662
<i>Naruto…you…</i>

1799
02:20:06,258 --> 02:20:10,262
Well, I've rambled on enough.

1800
02:20:11,376 --> 02:20:12,669
Damn it.

1801
02:20:12,742 --> 02:20:16,454
A poor talker like me lecturing you,
it's not my style.

1802
02:20:18,800 --> 02:20:23,096
If we both end up dying…

1803
02:20:24,624 --> 02:20:28,253
You won't be an Uchiha and
I won't be the Nine-Tail's Jinchuriki.

1804
02:20:28,628 --> 02:20:30,755
We'll be free of all our burdens.

1805
02:20:31,418 --> 02:20:34,171
And we'll finally be able to understand
each other in the next world!

1806
02:20:41,766 --> 02:20:43,768
I don't plan on changing.

1807
02:20:44,164 --> 02:20:45,999
Nor am I interested
in understanding you.

1808
02:20:46,539 --> 02:20:48,040
And I don't plan on dying!

1809
02:20:48,953 --> 02:20:50,538
You're the one who's going to die.

1810
02:20:52,174 --> 02:20:54,927
If I die, we both die, Sasuke.

1811
02:21:08,077 --> 02:21:11,997
Fine then! I'll kill you first.

1812
02:21:13,021 --> 02:21:17,776
It's clear you still haven't
acknowledged me yet.

1813
02:21:18,236 --> 02:21:20,905
Enough, Naruto.
I'll take Sasuke on.

1814
02:21:21,825 --> 02:21:24,786
You have your precious dream
of becoming the Hokage.

1815
02:21:25,374 --> 02:21:27,710
I can't let Sasuke take
you down with him.

1816
02:21:27,735 --> 02:21:29,946
How can I become the Hokage

1817
02:21:30,514 --> 02:21:32,891
if I can't even save one friend?!

1818
02:21:33,094 --> 02:21:36,764
I'll fight Sasuke!

1819
02:21:43,055 --> 02:21:46,058
All right, Naruto.
I'll leave Sasuke to you.

1820
02:21:46,836 --> 02:21:48,296
However, Sakura…

1821
02:21:49,292 --> 02:21:51,002
Watch over my body.

1822
02:21:51,878 --> 02:21:54,047
<i>I'll get rid of Madara
once and for all.</i>

1823
02:21:54,506 --> 02:21:55,140
<i>Kamui!</i>

1824
02:21:55,623 --> 02:21:57,416
Forget it, Kakashi.

1825
02:21:57,674 --> 02:22:00,009
A jutsu like that won't work on me.

1826
02:22:02,680 --> 02:22:04,307
Let's go, Sasuke.

1827
02:22:04,687 --> 02:22:08,899
Madara, I'll talk to you later.

1828
02:22:21,449 --> 02:22:24,244
I'll be ready anytime, Sasuke.

1829
02:22:25,255 --> 02:22:28,425
<i>Naruto...Thank you, as always!</i>

1830
02:22:30,002 --> 02:22:32,904
<i>Because of you,
I can still hope for the day</i>

1831
02:22:32,929 --> 02:22:36,540
<i>that we'll laugh together again
as Team 7.</i>

1832
02:22:41,272 --> 02:22:42,878
– What?!
– Wha—?!

1833
02:22:44,074 --> 02:22:45,242
Naruto!

1834
02:22:49,178 --> 02:22:50,967
A scratch on his cheek.
This must be the cause.

1835
02:22:52,346 --> 02:22:53,347
Then it's…

1836
02:22:56,764 --> 02:22:59,586
It's from the poison-dipped
kunai knife I used earlier.

1837
02:23:01,045 --> 02:23:02,755
Seems like it.

1838
02:23:04,177 --> 02:23:06,346
You need to administer
the antidote right away, Sakura!

1839
02:23:12,899 --> 02:23:14,859
What did you want
to talk to me about?

1840
02:23:15,807 --> 02:23:17,433
I want Itachi's eyes.

1841
02:23:19,669 --> 02:23:21,921
So you finally made up your mind.

1842
02:23:23,304 --> 02:23:25,180
You've overused the Susano'o.

1843
02:23:25,549 --> 02:23:28,260
I'm aware that you can barely see.

1844
02:23:30,062 --> 02:23:31,855
It's perfect timing.

1845
02:23:32,707 --> 02:23:34,418
Transplant them right away.

1846
02:23:34,789 --> 02:23:37,917
You're in a hurry.
What's going on?

1847
02:23:38,684 --> 02:23:41,293
I'm going use every ounce of
my strength to crush Naruto!

1848
02:23:41,442 --> 02:23:44,028
I'll eradicate him completely!

1849
02:23:44,492 --> 02:23:45,785
That's all.

1850
02:23:48,426 --> 02:23:50,302
I'm taking you to Hidden Leaf Village.

1851
02:23:51,456 --> 02:23:53,041
So please behave yourself.

1852
02:23:53,989 --> 02:23:56,867
I wouldn't try anything at this point.

1853
02:23:58,830 --> 02:24:00,420
I still feel sick.

1854
02:24:00,445 --> 02:24:02,071
A-Are you all right?

1855
02:24:04,399 --> 02:24:05,987
You're gonna throw up!

1856
02:24:07,238 --> 02:24:08,353
<i>So that's…</i>

1857
02:24:09,375 --> 02:24:11,544
<i>Naruto Uzumaki, huh?</i>

1858
02:24:13,728 --> 02:24:15,730
Are you ready?

1859
02:24:16,180 --> 02:24:17,556
Do it.

1860
02:24:21,716 --> 02:24:22,975
<i>Brother…</i>

1861
02:24:28,534 --> 02:24:31,120
<i>I will crush the Hidden Leaf!</i>
