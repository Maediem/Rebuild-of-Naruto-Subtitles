1
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:14,431
<i>What is a clan?</i>

2
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,622
<i>What is a village?</i>

3
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:28,459
<i>What is…a shinobi?</i>

4
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:36,995
What am I?

5
00:00:46,896 --> 00:00:48,147
Found you!

6
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:52,886
You guys…?

7
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:57,941
What're you doing here?

8
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:00,793
Stopping the Reanimation.

9
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,312
Huh?

10
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,648
This is Kabuto?

11
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:07,859
He's kind of gross, huh?

12
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:12,029
This one coming out of
his gut looks like a huge—

13
00:01:12,054 --> 00:01:14,014
Just leave him be.

14
00:01:16,425 --> 00:01:17,551
She's alive.

15
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:21,206
What do you want with me
at this point?

16
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,750
Why'd you go out of your way
to look for me?

17
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,878
Oh yeah! That's right. See…

18
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:30,613
We found something incredible
in one of the hideouts.

19
00:01:31,073 --> 00:01:32,291
Now let's see…

20
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:36,637
Earlier, you said that you and Itachi
stopped the Reanimation, right?

21
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:42,602
But I don't think it worked
on the reanimated Madara.

22
00:01:44,278 --> 00:01:45,571
I see.

23
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,899
So it hasn't been stopped.

24
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,112
I'm talking to Sasuke!
Don't interrupt me.

25
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,614
Anyway, never mind that.

26
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,741
Look!

27
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,159
Look, look!

28
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,127
See! Amazing, right?!

29
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:11,214
With this, we Taka can rule
the shinobi world!

30
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,382
This is it…

31
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:19,889
I have to meet up with someone.

32
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,016
I'm leaving.

33
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,726
Huh? Who?

34
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,687
Orochimaru.

35
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:26,896
Huh?!

36
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,606
What are you talking about?

37
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,309
You killed Orochimaru!

38
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:34,112
Are you really surprised someone as
tenacious as Orochimaru

39
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,030
might not be killed so easily?

40
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:42,078
And even if I do find him vile…

41
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,038
I need him to do something for me.

42
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,000
It's time to see the all-knowing.

43
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,461
What do you mean,
“see” Orochimaru?

44
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:53,214
Who is this all-knowing person?

45
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,634
You don't need to know.

46
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,224
What? I don't get it.

47
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,351
In any case,

48
00:03:05,534 --> 00:03:08,077
Orochimaru must never be resurrected!

49
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,899
You probably want to ask
Orochimaru for help

50
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,443
in using the power of the scroll, right?

51
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,988
Just give it time and
you'll figure it out.

52
00:03:17,272 --> 00:03:20,942
That's why we looked for you and…

53
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:23,803
There are still things only
Orochimaru can do.

54
00:03:24,362 --> 00:03:26,489
Sasuke, tell me…

55
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:31,002
You were Orochimaru's
favorite pupil, right?

56
00:03:31,226 --> 00:03:32,394
So why can't you…?

57
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:33,420
Suigetsu!

58
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:35,757
Listen.

59
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:37,774
Huh? What?

60
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,386
Don't underestimate Orochimaru.

61
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:44,657
Idiot!

62
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,559
I don't underestimate him!

63
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,519
It's the exact opposite!

64
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,805
You were able to bring
down Orochimaru

65
00:03:50,937 --> 00:03:52,449
only because both his arms

66
00:03:52,474 --> 00:03:55,257
were useless from
the Reaper Death Seal, that's all.

67
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,779
You're the one
who's underestimating him!

68
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:02,492
Even if he is revived,
his arms will probably still be useless.

69
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,410
But he'll still be dangerous.

70
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,205
He's going to come after
your body again!

71
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:11,042
If he finds out about this war,
he's going to want to be a part of it.

72
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,419
He wants to destroy the Leaf too!

73
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:18,424
And that means that Team Taka
will get mixed up in this war!

74
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,301
Are you okay with that?

75
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:25,223
We succeeded in beating
our superiors.

76
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,766
It's our time now!

77
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:32,864
Who'd want to see Orochimaru now?

78
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:34,756
Hasn't he caused us
enough trouble?

79
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:36,556
Shut up, Suigetsu.

80
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:42,671
Cut out and bring me
a piece of Kabuto's flesh.

81
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,329
Huh?

82
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,096
You don't listen to me,
but you expect me to listen to you?

83
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,082
I'll do it.

84
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,544
It's always like this…

85
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,630
Jugo, are you okay with this?

86
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:00,233
Orochimaru's going to
be resurrected, you know…

87
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:01,926
I don't care.

88
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,220
Sasuke's will is Kimimaro's will.

89
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,431
I will abide by it.

90
00:05:13,904 --> 00:05:15,232
You're just the same.

91
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,358
What is going on with all of this?

92
00:05:18,784 --> 00:05:21,870
In my village,
we call it Sage Transformation.

93
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:25,199
My transformation originally
was the same thing.

94
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,078
But in all of my clones, it's called
the Curse Mark Transformation.

95
00:05:46,362 --> 00:05:48,322
I'm going to seal your Curse Mark.

96
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,058
<i>Curse Sealing!</i>

97
00:05:54,453 --> 00:05:57,748
<i>So the reverse of it is:
Curse Unsealing!</i>

98
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,259
Who could have imagined…

99
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:30,223
that it would be you who
would facilitate my return!

100
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,616
H-Hello there! Long time no see.

101
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:06,676
Orochimaru, there's something
I want you to do for me.

102
00:07:07,234 --> 00:07:10,279
Don't bother explaining.

103
00:07:11,755 --> 00:07:14,216
I've been watching from
inside Anko this whole time.

104
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:18,312
I secured My Sage jutsu chakra
into those Curse Marks.

105
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,816
They are like pieces of
my consciousness.

106
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,735
Then you know about the war too?

107
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,404
Of course.

108
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,833
I just have one thing to say
about that, Suigetsu.

109
00:07:31,433 --> 00:07:32,243
Huh?

110
00:07:33,076 --> 00:07:36,538
I have absolutely no interest
in this war.

111
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:38,017
Huh?!

112
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:42,003
It's someone else's war.

113
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,506
The only thing I'm interested
in right now…

114
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,508
Sasuke…

115
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,470
is your young body!

116
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,515
I told you!

117
00:07:54,656 --> 00:07:59,661
Having said that, I don't currently
have the power to steal it.

118
00:07:59,686 --> 00:08:01,214
<i>I wouldn't be so sure…</i>

119
00:08:05,493 --> 00:08:07,578
What is your intent
in meeting with them?

120
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:11,474
There's too much that I don't know.

121
00:08:12,474 --> 00:08:14,184
So I plan to ask them everything.

122
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:16,245
Everything?

123
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,998
There's no need to know it all.

124
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,334
You're still a child.

125
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,627
You're wrong.

126
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,006
<i>If I had been open
with you from the start…</i>

127
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:30,685
<i>and looked you straight in the eyes
and told you the truth.</i>

128
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,179
I'm not a child anymore.

129
00:08:34,755 --> 00:08:36,090
I can't stay a child.

130
00:08:38,183 --> 00:08:40,352
<i>And no matter what you do
from here on out…</i>

131
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,691
I want to know what started it all.

132
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:50,262
What I'm supposed to be,
what I'm supposed to do.

133
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,167
Are you questioning
your vengeance?

134
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:54,784
No…

135
00:08:55,192 --> 00:08:58,153
Not my quest for
vengeance itself.

136
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,614
Reuniting with Itachi
made my hatred

137
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:03,434
towards the Hidden Leaf
grow even stronger.

138
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:06,879
It's just…

139
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:09,483
I want to understand
how even in death,

140
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:12,303
Itachi could still consider
himself a Leaf shinobi,

141
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:14,520
and care about and
try to protect the village

142
00:09:14,545 --> 00:09:16,338
that dishonored his name.

143
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:21,519
Who was Itachi? What is a clan?
What is a village?

144
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,104
And so…

145
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,623
I want to know everything,
so I can finally have the answer.

146
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:28,542
I need to see with my own eyes and

147
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,152
decide with my own mind
what I must do.

148
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:39,245
<i>He's no longer the Sasuke
who was manipulated by Itachi…</i>

149
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,997
<i>or me…or Tobi.</i>

150
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,633
<i>What a strange sensation.</i>

151
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,887
He's going to absorb all of
Kabuto's power, and then kill him!

152
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,472
You better stay alert.

153
00:09:58,647 --> 00:10:00,314
He might try and catch you
off guard too!

154
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:04,854
The current you…isn't half bad.

155
00:10:20,243 --> 00:10:22,411
Didn't I tell you?
He did absorb his power!

156
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:24,031
No, you're wrong.

157
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,250
He undid the Sage Transformation.

158
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,003
He's taken back his own chakra
that was inside Kabuto.

159
00:10:29,386 --> 00:10:31,763
He didn't touch Kabuto's chakra.

160
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,925
Fine, I'll help you.

161
00:10:35,877 --> 00:10:37,219
Come along.

162
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,846
Where are we going?

163
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,892
Someplace you're very familiar with.

164
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:48,605
Let's be on our way.

165
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,123
I-Is that...?!

166
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,332
That's the...!

167
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,959
<i>There's no mistaking it.</i>

168
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,222
<i>What is this chakra?</i>

169
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,182
<i>They all sense the chakra,</i>

170
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:50,628
<i>even though none of them
are sensory types.</i>

171
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,205
<i>This chakra is...</i>

172
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:56,358
Let's go.

173
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,611
Hurry and
lead the way, Orochimaru.

174
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,947
<i>It looks like he's a bit concerned...</i>

175
00:13:03,475 --> 00:13:04,742
<i>about Naruto.</i>

176
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:13,334
This place sure has changed a lot too.

177
00:13:14,953 --> 00:13:16,754
What's up with Sasuke?

178
00:13:17,605 --> 00:13:20,424
He's just like how I was before
I wanted to destroy Leaf.

179
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:21,967
How so?

180
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:26,096
Even if both he and the village
have changed,

181
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:28,974
this place is still his homeland.

182
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:32,603
He needs some time to reaffirm
his decision and resolve,

183
00:13:32,819 --> 00:13:37,008
through immersing himself in sentimentality
and by retracing the past.

184
00:13:41,853 --> 00:13:42,979
Hmm...

185
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,741
So you're over it already?

186
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,036
The whole immerse yourself
in sentimentality

187
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,979
to affirm your resolve
to destroy the Leaf thing.

188
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,892
Hey, come to think of it,

189
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:58,576
we were all your cream of
the crop subordinates, right?

190
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,307
And now...
we're inside of the Leaf...

191
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,636
All the strong ones are gone
because they're away fighting.

192
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:10,683
Isn't this a perfect opportunity for you?

193
00:14:12,126 --> 00:14:13,377
Perhaps, indeed...

194
00:14:14,027 --> 00:14:15,987
Except for one thing...

195
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,651
You're no longer Hebi.

196
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,279
So this is it...

197
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,573
This place seems to be untouched.

198
00:14:25,914 --> 00:14:27,207
It's in shambles.

199
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,952
Well, I suppose it is way outside
the village.

200
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,247
Which one is it?

201
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,542
Let's see, it should be
around here somewhere.

202
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:43,507
There it is.

203
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,343
This place gives me the creeps...

204
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:49,231
If we've found what we were
looking for, let's get out of here!

205
00:14:50,205 --> 00:14:51,780
Yes, let's go...

206
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,687
to where all the secrets sleep.

207
00:15:04,135 --> 00:15:07,096
Oh, you use a jutsu to remove
the entry stone...

208
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:11,493
There's not even a trace of
the Uchiha's Nakano Shrine...

209
00:15:12,253 --> 00:15:15,247
The exterior doesn't matter.
What's important is what's beneath.

210
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:16,707
Let's go.

211
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,006
Well then, I'm going to get started.

212
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,577
It's best if you stand back.

213
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:49,198
<i>In order to perform
what is written in the scroll,</i>

214
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,493
<i>first, the Death God's Mask
is necessary.</i>

215
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,955
<i>That is located in
the Uzumaki Clan's Noh Mask Hall</i>

216
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,790
<i>on the outskirts of the Leaf Village.</i>

217
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:01,669
<i>Then one must allow the Death God
of the Reaper Death Seal</i>

218
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,629
<i>to possess oneself and
guide it forth.</i>

219
00:16:04,404 --> 00:16:07,708
<i>Slice open the Death God's abdomen
and the seal will come undone.</i>

220
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:13,055
<i>Though I shall then end up
a human sacrifice.</i>

221
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,103
<i>However, it will also allow me
to get back</i>

222
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:22,022
<i>both of my arms from inside
the Death God's belly.</i>

223
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,235
They're mine again!

224
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,123
<i>And if I can regain the power
that lies in those arms,</i>

225
00:16:30,548 --> 00:16:32,523
<i>I can perform the Reanimation.</i>

226
00:16:32,731 --> 00:16:33,624
<i>That's right...</i>

227
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,619
<i>I can revive those four.</i>

228
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:38,872
<i>Of course in that case,</i>

229
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:41,149
<i>you're well aware of what will
then become necessary...</i>

230
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,754
<i>You're planning on using us as sacrifices
for the Reanimation, aren't you?!</i>

231
00:16:47,922 --> 00:16:49,400
<i>That's not such a bad idea,</i>

232
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,136
<i>but we've actually got something
even better than you guys.</i>

233
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,264
<i>Though it's still invisible
to you yet.</i>

234
00:16:57,132 --> 00:17:00,635
Jugo, Sasuke, Suigetsu...
Get ready!

235
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,037
Got it.

236
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:08,235
<i>Jugo, bestow upon Sasuke some
of your Curse Mark Sage Power.</i>

237
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:18,962
<i>And when you do, the Zetsu that
Tobi stuck onto Sasuke to watch him</i>

238
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:22,791
<i>should respond and
rise to the surface.</i>

239
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:24,843
Damn it! How did you--?!

240
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,748
I know your Hashirama cells inside
and out from my experiments.

241
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,553
Including how to detect you,
of course.

242
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:40,726
Six of you, huh? Tobi sure
wasn't taking any chances!

243
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:45,230
<i>When I reclaimed and
reabsorbed my chakra from Kabuto,</i>

244
00:17:45,514 --> 00:17:48,233
<i>all his intel was transferred
inside me.</i>

245
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,779
<i>And he'd thoroughly
investigated the six Zetsu</i>

246
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,239
<i>that had been attached to Sasuke.</i>

247
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,202
<i>I possess those four's DNA as well,</i>

248
00:17:58,903 --> 00:18:01,455
<i>since I love collecting and
storing knowledge too.</i>

249
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:07,049
Suigetsu, Jugo...
Take care of the remaining two.

250
00:18:07,402 --> 00:18:09,880
Okay, Lord Orochimaru!

251
00:18:14,751 --> 00:18:16,461
<i>Reanimation Jutsu!</i>

252
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,064
Now, here I come!

253
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,949
They, who are all-knowing...

254
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,334
The previous Hokage!

255
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,881
That's the First Hokage?

256
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:57,302
The real Hashirama who's been
touted as a God of shinobi?

257
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,016
Don't tell me it's that
shinobi Orochimaru again!

258
00:19:03,441 --> 00:19:04,534
What do you mean?

259
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:10,065
I suspect he undid
the Reaper Deal

260
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,526
that has been keeping us
sealed away.

261
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,612
And then performed
the Reanimation Jutsu.

262
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:16,947
No way...

263
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,199
You found out how to undo
that Sealing Jutsu?

264
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,618
How did you do
that Mr. Orochimaru?

265
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,789
You underestimate me, Minato.

266
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,667
Originally a Sealing Jutsu
of the Uzumaki Clan...

267
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:33,805
I've been researching the ruins
and scattered documents

268
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:38,177
of the now extinct clan
ever since I lost my jutsu.

269
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,721
Lord First...

270
00:19:41,404 --> 00:19:44,514
It appears we've been recalled
into the world of the living.

271
00:19:47,077 --> 00:19:48,328
Who the hell are you?!

272
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,691
Oh, uh...

273
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,361
The Fourth Hokage, sir.

274
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,031
Oh? The Fourth Hokage,
you say?

275
00:19:59,056 --> 00:20:00,432
I see!

276
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,127
So the village has
remained stable!

277
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:09,166
Well, I'm not actually sure
if it has or not.

278
00:20:09,491 --> 00:20:13,587
Because I died and was sealed away
much earlier than Lord Third.

279
00:20:14,321 --> 00:20:16,239
Huh? Is that so...

280
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:20,166
In a separate incident than when
I was sealed away with Sarutobi?

281
00:20:20,343 --> 00:20:22,512
Yes...
a completely separate incident.

282
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,372
So who's the Fifth Hokage?

283
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,142
Your granddaughter,
Princess Tsunade.

284
00:20:30,036 --> 00:20:32,205
Tsuna, huh?

285
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:35,108
Is the village okay?

286
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,194
Is there something to be
worried about?

287
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,322
She was my first grandchild,
so I spoiled her rotten!

288
00:20:40,388 --> 00:20:44,434
In the end, she even picked up
my gambling habit...

289
00:20:49,056 --> 00:20:50,640
<i>He's not what I expected</i>

290
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:53,460
<i>of someone considered to be
the God of shinobi!</i>

291
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,921
<i>How do I put it?</i>

292
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,550
The Reanimation Jutsu again...

293
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,054
I can't believe the jutsu I devised
would be used so casually.

294
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,641
It's not a complex jutsu.

295
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,854
However, you should not have
created it in the first place.

296
00:21:13,054 --> 00:21:14,138
Lord Second...

297
00:21:14,298 --> 00:21:17,009
Many of your policies and jutsu
that you developed

298
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:20,913
ended up causing problems
later on down the line.

299
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,605
Even now...

300
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,631
Why you!

301
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,701
Are you planning on attacking
the Leaf again?!

302
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:32,958
I took away your jutsu
in exchange for my own life.

303
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,335
Yet you still--!

304
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:39,405
And this time you revived me,
your former master,

305
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,348
to pit me against the Leaf!

306
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,553
Conflict, no matter what the era.

307
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,639
It certainly cannot be called
that great a jutsu.

308
00:21:48,382 --> 00:21:50,968
Tobirama, that's why I told you
that time to...

309
00:21:50,993 --> 00:21:52,537
Will you be quiet, big brother?

310
00:21:53,261 --> 00:21:55,138
I am trying to talk to
this stripling right now.

311
00:21:55,256 --> 00:21:56,940
But I...

312
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:57,983
Shut up!

313
00:22:00,836 --> 00:22:03,798
So not dignified for
the God of shinobi!

314
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:06,008
Please do not misunderstand.

315
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:10,120
I don't have any more leanings
in that direction.

316
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,957
Haven't you noticed that I'm not
suppressing your personalities?

317
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,960
There are certain circumstances
at play this time.

318
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:21,506
I'm merely creating a stage for
discourse per his strong desire.

319
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:27,554
I'm Sasuke Uchiha and I want to
ask you Hokage some things.

320
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,848
Is that you Sasuke?

321
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,476
You belong to the Uchiha?

322
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,519
Of course you'd stick with
a scoundrel.

323
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:38,273
Tobirama! I told you to stop
saying such things!

324
00:22:38,373 --> 00:22:39,582
You're too soft, big brother!

325
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,318
Never mind me.

326
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,195
Lord Third...

327
00:22:43,419 --> 00:22:45,004
Why did you make Itachi
do what he did?

328
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,909
So, you've learned of
what happened.

329
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:55,624
I...killed Itachi to avenge
the Uchiha Clan.

330
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:01,963
Afterwards, I learned the truth
from Tobi and Danzo.

331
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,509
And I leaned towards swearing
vengeance against the Leaf.

332
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:10,538
However, I want to hear it
straight from your mouth.

333
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:13,850
Everything regarding Itachi.

334
00:23:15,126 --> 00:23:16,502
So it came to that...

335
00:23:22,942 --> 00:23:25,194
Not only did I have him
kill his brethren...

336
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,107
I also had him bear
the false charge of traitor...

337
00:23:28,132 --> 00:23:32,178
and keep tabs on the Akatsuki
all by himself.

338
00:23:32,727 --> 00:23:34,855
From the time he was
a small child,

339
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,145
Itachi paid attention
to the teachings and signs

340
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:39,380
of our predecessors that
no one else gave heed to.

341
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:45,416
He was a sensitive child who understood
our village's past and our shinobi.

342
00:23:46,082 --> 00:23:47,291
And perhaps due to that,

343
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:51,096
the trappings of a clan
never bound Itachi.

344
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:55,600
He was able to think ahead about
the future of shinobi and of the village.

345
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,854
And constantly had misgivings
regarding those futures.

346
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:04,117
Even at the age of seven,
he thought like a Hokage.

347
00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:08,388
We left everything to Itachi
in his hands alone...

348
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:11,541
and he executed
his missions perfectly.

349
00:24:12,267 --> 00:24:15,392
He killed his entire clan
and stopped a revolt.

350
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:18,457
Prevented a coming war
all by himself.

351
00:24:18,631 --> 00:24:23,094
He even infiltrated the Akatsuki as
a spy to protect the village.

352
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:29,142
On the condition that I protect you
within the village.

353
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,053
So it's all true.

354
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:35,849
This is part of
the Uchiha's cursed fate.

355
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,562
I can't believe they're on
the brink of extinction.

356
00:24:42,096 --> 00:24:44,182
So they even plotted a coup...

357
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,528
I'd envisioned that it might come
to something like that.

358
00:24:49,379 --> 00:24:52,632
The rebellious elements bearing
Madara's will had been smoldering.

359
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,995
But you're the one who drove
the Uchiha to it, Lord Second...

360
00:24:57,311 --> 00:24:59,690
It could be said that
the seeds got sown

361
00:24:59,715 --> 00:25:02,209
with the Uchiha Police Force
that you created.

362
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:03,393
What did you say?

363
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:08,673
Those who crack down on crime
tend to be easily disliked.

364
00:25:09,098 --> 00:25:10,516
The more authority
such a group has,

365
00:25:10,641 --> 00:25:13,352
the more conceited it can get.

366
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:16,765
By building the Police Station
next to the prison

367
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:19,509
under the pretext of facilitating
the monitoring of criminals,

368
00:25:19,534 --> 00:25:23,480
you conspicuously shoved the
Uchiha Clan to the margins of the village.

369
00:25:25,131 --> 00:25:28,009
That's what fostered
the adherents to Madara.

370
00:25:31,253 --> 00:25:32,296
Tobirama!

371
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:35,033
Did I not emphasize to you
over and over again

372
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,451
not to slight the Uchiha?

373
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:39,204
But I gave them positions that
they were eminently qualified for.

374
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,346
And I believed that even if
another Madara were to emerge,

375
00:25:41,371 --> 00:25:43,614
he could be dealt with right away.

376
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:48,129
As you well know, older brother,
the Uchiha are...

377
00:25:49,931 --> 00:25:51,825
...a clan possessed by evil!

378
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:58,348
It's like Madara left
a psychological scar upon you.

379
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:01,059
To cause such fear of the Uchiha.

380
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:04,770
You stripling.
You do not know Madara.

381
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:08,650
Second Hokage,
a question for you...

382
00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:13,137
What is it about the Uchiha Clan?
What do you know?

383
00:26:19,476 --> 00:26:22,181
The Senju and Uchiha Clans

384
00:26:22,663 --> 00:26:25,457
share a long history
of battling each other.

385
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:29,712
We were once bitter enemies.

386
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,257
I know that already...

387
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,677
What did you mean about
the Uchiha being possessed by evil?

388
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,723
There used to be a thought that
in contrast to the Senju Clan,

389
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,059
who based their strength in love
as opposed to jutsu...

390
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:47,856
The basis of the Uchiha Clan's
strength was the power of their jutsu.

391
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,817
However, the truth
is actually different.

392
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:55,405
There is no clan that feels
deeper love than the Uchiha.

393
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:59,034
And that is why the Uchiha have
suppressed and sealed it away.

394
00:27:00,034 --> 00:27:01,494
What do you mean?!

395
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:05,482
Once a member of the Uchiha
knows love, it's almost as if

396
00:27:05,573 --> 00:27:08,993
all of his or her previously
checked emotions are released.

397
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,881
They awaken a profound love and
power that exceeds even the Senju's.

398
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,883
But why is that a problem?

399
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,519
It should help things go smoothly
with the Senju too...

400
00:27:18,245 --> 00:27:20,247
This super-strong
power of love, right?

401
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,433
Except it is quite problematic.

402
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:28,480
This great power hides within it
the possibility of going out of control.

403
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,208
When an Uchiha who has known
love loses that deep love,

404
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:38,322
it is replaced by an even
stronger hate that changes them.

405
00:27:39,548 --> 00:27:41,467
I've seen it happen
quite a few times.

406
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:45,497
And that's when
a special condition emerges.

407
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,465
Condition?

408
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:51,461
When an Uchiha writhes
in agony over the loss

409
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:54,798
of a great love or disappointment
in themselves,

410
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,175
a unique chakra is released
inside their brain and

411
00:27:57,217 --> 00:28:00,595
reacts with the optic nerves and
changes appear that person's eyes.

412
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,640
The eyes that reflect the heart.

413
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,642
This is what we call the Sharingan.

414
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,438
The Sharingan taps into
the power of that person's heart,

415
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,443
rapidly increasing their strength,
along with the power of their hate.

416
00:28:16,769 --> 00:28:20,038
There were many sensitive
individuals among the Uchiha,

417
00:28:20,063 --> 00:28:22,065
and nearly all who were
exposed to strong emotions

418
00:28:22,215 --> 00:28:24,593
were taken over by darkness
and fell to evil.

419
00:28:25,011 --> 00:28:28,339
The deeper the darkness gets the
greater the visual prowess becomes,

420
00:28:28,364 --> 00:28:30,106
until the person can
no longer be stopped.

421
00:28:30,131 --> 00:28:31,382
Just like Madara.

422
00:28:32,902 --> 00:28:35,562
Madara cared deeply
for his younger brother...

423
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:39,050
His love was, perhaps, greater
than your brother's love for you.

424
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:42,053
I thought I had arranged
and guided things as such

425
00:28:42,078 --> 00:28:44,914
that the Uchiha's power could
be harnessed to serve the village.

426
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:49,102
Although if they self-destructed
for the sake of the village,

427
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,770
then so be it.

428
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,107
Either way, in the end, they were
of use to the Leaf Village.

429
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,860
Tobirama! Stop talking like that!

430
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:00,447
You are speaking to
an innocent Uchiha child!

431
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,282
What is all-important
is the village.

432
00:29:02,682 --> 00:29:03,808
The village is the keystone.

433
00:29:04,351 --> 00:29:06,061
I know that you know
that too older brother.

434
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,878
It doesn't bother me.

435
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:11,455
I am neither innocent nor a child.

436
00:29:12,992 --> 00:29:14,577
<i>It's not the standard pattern...</i>

437
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:17,172
<i>It's the Mangekyo Sharingan...</i>

438
00:29:18,856 --> 00:29:21,734
First Hokage...I ask you this...

439
00:29:22,818 --> 00:29:24,319
What does it mean to be a village?

440
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,349
And what does it mean
to be a shinobi?

441
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:33,521
What is a village,
and what are shinobi?

442
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:38,318
My older brother Itachi, despite
having been used by the Leaf,

443
00:29:38,417 --> 00:29:40,127
defended the village with his life.

444
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:43,239
He died a proud Leaf shinobi.

445
00:29:44,925 --> 00:29:47,111
So what exactly is this village,
that one strives to protect

446
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:49,803
even if it means killing one's kin?

447
00:29:49,828 --> 00:29:51,071
Even if it means their own death?

448
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:55,084
And what are shinobi who've
created such circumstances

449
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,545
and consider them acceptable?

450
00:29:59,122 --> 00:30:02,717
I'll listen to your response
and find out the truth,

451
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,469
and then I'll make my decision...

452
00:30:07,329 --> 00:30:09,373
Whether or not to declare
vengeance against the Leaf.

453
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:10,892
Or...

454
00:30:13,695 --> 00:30:15,947
You brat possessed
with the Uchiha evil!

455
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,149
In that case I shall...

456
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,147
Lord Second!

457
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,241
Tobirama!

458
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:33,631
<i>Now we're talking presence!</i>

459
00:30:37,861 --> 00:30:38,904
Lower your finger.

460
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,924
All right...

461
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:45,718
Don't get your chakra
so riled up, brother.

462
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,723
Sorry about that!

463
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:55,728
Wow, that's incredible!

464
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:59,065
<i>You haven't changed a bit,
Lord Hashirama...</i>

465
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:08,575
Well then, Sasuke,
you had a good older brother.

466
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,910
He was a greater shinobi
than I ever was!

467
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,037
I don't mind telling you more
about the village,

468
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,539
but it will take a while.

469
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,457
If possible, could you
please tell the child

470
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,751
everything he wants
to know quickly?

471
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,087
We don't have much time.

472
00:31:21,896 --> 00:31:23,189
No time?

473
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,091
We're in the middle of a war.

474
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,343
Madara Uchiha has been revived

475
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:30,179
and apparently intends to erase
all the shinobi of this world.

476
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:36,853
Always conflict,
no matter what the era.

477
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,818
I definitely feel
some powerful chakra

478
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,070
in the direction of 2 o'clock.

479
00:31:47,162 --> 00:31:49,999
<i>This is Naruto and
Nine-Tails' chakra.</i>

480
00:31:50,274 --> 00:31:51,317
<i>I see</i>

481
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:52,885
<i>So you did it, Naruto!</i>

482
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:55,997
<i>And you're fighting together...
even now!</i>

483
00:31:58,532 --> 00:31:59,992
It seems to be true.

484
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,854
I'm definitely sensing
Madara's chakra.

485
00:32:03,295 --> 00:32:05,547
Then we ought to head
to the battlefield.

486
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:09,719
As all of you are under the control
of my Reanimation Jutsu,

487
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,013
your movements can be restricted.

488
00:32:12,379 --> 00:32:13,714
If you insist,

489
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,934
you may head to the battlefield
after we finish talking.

490
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,435
Talk later!

491
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,938
Do you truly understand

492
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:22,490
the gravity of Madara
having been revived?

493
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:25,151
I'm sticking with this child.

494
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:27,478
If Sasuke isn't satisfied
with your explanation,

495
00:32:27,895 --> 00:32:32,983
I may use all of you to destroy
the Leaf now.

496
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,178
The timing couldn't be better.

497
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:42,877
This jutsu--!

498
00:32:43,352 --> 00:32:44,645
Orochimaru, was it?

499
00:32:45,112 --> 00:32:46,946
You seem to be
misunderstanding something.

500
00:32:48,432 --> 00:32:51,310
The fact that you've upped
the precision of the Reanimation

501
00:32:51,335 --> 00:32:53,545
since the last time shall
be your downfall.

502
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,392
Now that we've been revived
at close to our original power...

503
00:32:57,741 --> 00:33:00,578
I am not someone who can be bound

504
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:04,524
by the Reanimation of
one such as you.

505
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,642
Do not forget,

506
00:33:06,667 --> 00:33:08,836
I am the one who devised
this jutsu in the first place.

507
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,823
Older brother, you must agree
that we have no choice.

508
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,408
I will take action!

509
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:20,289
Sarutobi, you sure raised
quite a shinobi.

510
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:24,151
It is an honor to be praised
by the God of shinobi himself.

511
00:33:28,314 --> 00:33:31,609
He's acquired my cells and
enhanced his power to bind us!

512
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:34,836
Tobirama...
Your instincts have dulled a bit.

513
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,389
<i>Damn him...</i>

514
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,474
<i>Taking a closer look,</i>

515
00:33:38,499 --> 00:33:41,252
<i>most of his body is composed
of my older brother's cells...</i>

516
00:33:42,336 --> 00:33:43,796
<i>First Hokage Hashirama...</i>

517
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,566
<i>He's different.</i>

518
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,403
<i>He could undo my binding
at any time...</i>

519
00:33:51,012 --> 00:33:53,055
<i>I have to be careful not
to let down my guard.</i>

520
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:56,042
Orochimaru...Do not fret.

521
00:33:56,484 --> 00:34:00,372
My priority is to undo the ill
feelings that are binding this child.

522
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:05,585
I don't know what he will decide
after he is done listening to me...

523
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:07,503
But if we ignore him now,

524
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:10,548
he will definitely become
the next Madara.

525
00:34:11,474 --> 00:34:15,553
If that happens, ending the war
and winning will be meaningless.

526
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:20,791
Do as you please, older brother.

527
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:23,436
Now then...

528
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,230
Where should I start?

529
00:34:27,772 --> 00:34:29,733
<i>Yes...</i>

530
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,618
This time, I'll reach
the other side for sure.

531
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:48,711
Just aim it a little higher
than you'd expect.

532
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,338
That's the trick.

533
00:34:51,497 --> 00:34:53,439
I don't need you to tell me that.

534
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,010
It will reach the other side
if I put my all into it!

535
00:34:56,476 --> 00:34:57,844
Who the hell are you anyway?

536
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:03,309
Right now, I'm just your rival
at stone skipping.

537
00:35:04,059 --> 00:35:05,619
Though mine has already
reached the other side.

538
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:11,776
<i>That was the first time
I encountered Madara Uchiha.</i>

539
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,320
I asked you who you are!

540
00:35:14,803 --> 00:35:16,263
It's Hashirama.

541
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,241
I can't tell you my last name
due to reasons...

542
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,284
Hashirama, eh?

543
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,412
Well, just watch.
I'm gonna make it this time.

544
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,251
<i>The way he throws…</i>

545
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:31,003
<i>I'm sure…
It's the shuriken jutsu!</i>

546
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:42,515
Hey! You stood behind me
on purpose to distract me!

547
00:35:42,965 --> 00:35:47,446
I'm the type that can't even pee
when someone's standing behind me!

548
00:35:51,656 --> 00:35:52,657
S-Sorry!

549
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:57,655
Hey...Don't take it so seriously…

550
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,909
Sorry, I was just making excuses…

551
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,787
I…I didn't know…

552
00:36:05,737 --> 00:36:08,433
That you had such an obnoxious
self-diagnosed neurosis...

553
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:12,001
I can't tell if you're a nice guy
or a nasty guy!

554
00:36:13,753 --> 00:36:16,881
One thing for sure! I'm better
than you at stone skipping!

555
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:19,510
Want me to skip you instead?

556
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:23,906
S-Sorry...I didn't mean to upset you.

557
00:36:24,481 --> 00:36:28,568
To make amends,
I'll let you throw me into the river.

558
00:36:29,486 --> 00:36:30,529
Go ahead, throw me.

559
00:36:30,837 --> 00:36:34,800
Do you even notice
your own obnoxious neurosis?

560
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:38,730
I just...hope I reach
the opposite shore...

561
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,616
You're a real eyesore!
Get lost!

562
00:36:42,759 --> 00:36:43,701
Well then...

563
00:36:43,909 --> 00:36:45,577
Wait a second!

564
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:48,789
Which is it?
Why don't you be more clear?

565
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,750
Th-That's…

566
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,714
That's…!

567
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:05,264
Are you…a shinobi?

568
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:11,646
This location will become
a battlefield soon. Go home.

569
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,316
<i>This is a Hagoromo Clan crest…</i>

570
00:37:15,774 --> 00:37:17,867
Sorry, but I've got to go…

571
00:37:20,354 --> 00:37:21,355
So long…

572
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:22,698
Uh…

573
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:24,459
It's Madara.

574
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:26,661
Madara…

575
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:29,822
Not proffering one's family name
to a stranger...

576
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,166
is shinobi law.

577
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,586
I knew it…

578
00:37:35,927 --> 00:37:37,373
You're a shinobi too.

579
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,511
<i>Our personalities differed,</i>

580
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:47,390
<i>and yet I sensed
a mysterious kinship with him.</i>

581
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:51,686
<i>I felt I knew why he'd come down
to the river too.</i>

582
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,381
Kawarama...

583
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:16,384
Shinobi do not cry!

584
00:38:17,269 --> 00:38:20,022
Shinobi are born into this world
to fight and die in battle.

585
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:24,552
Be grateful that we have
even a piece of his corpse!

586
00:38:25,794 --> 00:38:30,774
For our enemy this time includes the Uchiha
Clan in addition to the Hagoromo Clan!

587
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:34,228
They are particularly merciless!

588
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,690
Kawarama was just seven years old!

589
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:41,610
How long…will this kind
of fighting continue?!

590
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:44,530
Until the very last foe
has been vanquished.

591
00:38:44,779 --> 00:38:48,626
The path to a battle-free world
is not easily made!

592
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,538
And children must be sacrificed?

593
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,587
I will not allow Kawarama
to be disrespected!

594
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:03,758
He fought and died as
a full-fledged shinobi!

595
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,343
He was not a child!

596
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:15,436
Older brother Hashirama, are you okay?

597
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:19,732
You know what happens
when we defy Father.

598
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:23,944
<i>I…don't want…</i>

599
00:39:25,045 --> 00:39:28,507
<i>either of you, Itama or Tobirama…</i>

600
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:32,078
<i>to die in vain!</i>

601
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:36,415
The Senju, the clan of love? As if!

602
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,358
A full-fledged shinobi, my butt!

603
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:42,713
All of this is just grown-ups
driving kids to their deaths!

604
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:46,717
We're doing exactly
the same thing as the Uchiha!

605
00:39:47,267 --> 00:39:49,061
That's how we honor our opponents.

606
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:53,808
Even an infant wielding a weapon
is deemed an enemy.

607
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:58,771
And to raise one's child to become
full-fledged is a parent's love!

608
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:02,900
So in order to become full-fledged,
you have to die?!

609
00:40:02,941 --> 00:40:04,427
We kill and are killed so much,

610
00:40:04,452 --> 00:40:06,695
you can't even keep track
of all the grudges!

611
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:09,073
And it's too risky to even divulge
our family names!

612
00:40:10,185 --> 00:40:13,369
There's something totally wrong
about a ninja world like this!

613
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:16,571
Children like you are called brats!

614
00:40:16,596 --> 00:40:17,639
Father…

615
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,543
Older Brother's feeling depressed today…

616
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,253
So please forgive him.

617
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:32,213
Hashirama, go and cool your head.

618
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,063
Grown-ups are stupid.

619
00:40:41,797 --> 00:40:46,569
If they want to stop the fighting,
they should make a pact…

620
00:40:46,894 --> 00:40:49,905
But…what about avenging
our parents and brothers…

621
00:40:50,105 --> 00:40:51,940
and all our friends who were killed?

622
00:40:52,282 --> 00:40:55,118
Keeping saying stuff like that
and you'll end up dead too.

623
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,997
You and the adults are both hotheaded.

624
00:40:58,323 --> 00:40:59,165
Sorry…

625
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:02,001
Forthcoming shinobi must suppress
their emotions,

626
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:07,063
create suitable rules that they then
follow and avoid extraneous conflict.

627
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,678
Can't a true pact...

628
00:41:14,197 --> 00:41:16,348
an alliance be achieved?

629
00:41:19,902 --> 00:41:21,611
What's a true pact?

630
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,569
<i>During the Era of Warring States,</i>

631
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,354
<i>the average life expectance
of both shinobi and citizens</i>

632
00:41:31,379 --> 00:41:33,089
<i>was around 30 years old.</i>

633
00:41:40,638 --> 00:41:43,850
<i>And the reason
the average was so low was...</i>

634
00:41:58,766 --> 00:41:59,767
Itama!

635
00:42:00,227 --> 00:42:03,646
<i>The deaths of many young children.</i>

636
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:04,730
Itama!

637
00:42:32,474 --> 00:42:34,742
Hey, long time no see!

638
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,012
Umm…

639
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:38,973
It's Hashirama.

640
00:42:39,831 --> 00:42:43,793
So, Hashirama…
You seem awfully down.

641
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:45,396
What happened?

642
00:42:46,037 --> 00:42:47,372
What's with you!

643
00:42:47,823 --> 00:42:48,824
I'm fine!

644
00:42:49,174 --> 00:42:52,467
Liar...You can talk to me, you know.

645
00:42:53,628 --> 00:42:54,254
It's nothing…

646
00:42:54,529 --> 00:42:56,367
Come on, tell me.

647
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,159
I said it's nothing.

648
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:03,004
Hey, stop dragging this out!
I promise I'll listen!

649
00:43:03,571 --> 00:43:05,316
It's really nothing…

650
00:43:06,157 --> 00:43:07,241
Nothing at all.

651
00:43:07,266 --> 00:43:09,116
Out with it!

652
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,698
What's the matter?

653
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,179
My little brother…died.

654
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:25,144
I come to the river

655
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:28,606
because I feel like
all the haziness in my heart

656
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,816
gets washed away as
I stare at the water.

657
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:33,560
So that's what happened...

658
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,239
Your name's Madara, right…?

659
00:43:38,307 --> 00:43:40,059
I wonder if you're like me…

660
00:43:43,578 --> 00:43:45,371
Do you have siblings?

661
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:47,958
I'm one of five.

662
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,435
Well, there used to be five of us.

663
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,549
Used to?

664
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:57,760
We're shinobi.

665
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,095
We never know when
we're going to die.

666
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,182
If there were a way where
neither side had to die...

667
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:07,811
It would be where both sides revealed their
insides, and hid nothing from each other...

668
00:44:08,261 --> 00:44:10,930
And poured each other drinks
and drank together like brothers.

669
00:44:12,031 --> 00:44:13,867
But that's impossible...

670
00:44:14,659 --> 00:44:19,372
Because one can't look deep
into another's insides down to their guts.

671
00:44:22,125 --> 00:44:24,794
In reality, they could be as mad as hell.

672
00:44:27,189 --> 00:44:28,523
Isn't it possible…

673
00:44:29,007 --> 00:44:31,342
to really show how you feel
without showing your guts?

674
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:33,796
I don't know…

675
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:35,373
But every time I come here,

676
00:44:35,398 --> 00:44:38,396
I pray for some way
to make it happen.

677
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:48,018
I finally got it to go
in the right direction.

678
00:44:48,735 --> 00:44:50,236
You're not the only one…

679
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:51,855
Me too…

680
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:53,857
It reached.

681
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,238
<i>In all honesty, I was shocked…</i>

682
00:44:59,755 --> 00:45:02,633
<i>That one person understood
how I felt</i>

683
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,952
<i>despite all the people
that didn't.</i>

684
00:45:05,694 --> 00:45:11,033
<i>So there was another foolish kid,
who thought as I did,</i>

685
00:45:11,066 --> 00:45:12,651
<i>to try to change this war-torn era.</i>

686
00:45:13,735 --> 00:45:16,972
<i>Maybe shocked isn't the right word…</i>

687
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:20,759
<i>To me, Madara was a gift
from the divine.</i>

688
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:25,989
In your case…I can tell without
looking into your insides that...

689
00:45:26,163 --> 00:45:26,782
What?

690
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:30,686
That your hairdo and outfit
are totally lame!

691
00:45:34,923 --> 00:45:38,802
<i>Not that we thought alike
in every respect...</i>

692
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:42,239
<i>After that, we started
meeting up every now and then,</i>

693
00:45:43,247 --> 00:45:45,625
<i>still without knowing
each other's family names...</i>

694
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,787
<i>We'd spar and
compare our shinobi moves</i>

695
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:52,249
<i>or talk about the future…</i>

696
00:45:54,133 --> 00:45:55,468
Taijutsu and kumite.

697
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:59,339
Nice job pulling a draw against me!

698
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:01,675
It's not a draw...

699
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,427
I'm still standing.

700
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:04,244
Huh?

701
00:46:05,036 --> 00:46:06,079
Ouch!

702
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:11,435
What were you saying?
How's this not a draw?

703
00:46:12,594 --> 00:46:13,720
When did you…?

704
00:46:15,855 --> 00:46:18,065
I threw it the instant
you blew me away.

705
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:21,069
I'm not gonna be
beaten that easily.

706
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:28,692
But the question is, how do
we change things concretely?

707
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,288
We've got to have
a vision for the future.

708
00:46:32,272 --> 00:46:35,025
The first steps are for us to
not give up on our ideals

709
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:37,484
and to get a lot stronger.

710
00:46:38,127 --> 00:46:40,687
Weak pups barking
won't change a thing.

711
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:46,094
Right. If we master all sorts
of jutsu and get stronger,

712
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:49,765
the adults won't be able
to ignore our words anymore.

713
00:46:50,874 --> 00:46:53,793
We gotta master many jutsu
and cover any weaknesses.

714
00:46:56,438 --> 00:47:01,151
Well...I am stronger than most adults
around me already.

715
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:03,695
No kidding? I'm impressed.

716
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,375
You really can't, eh…?

717
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:19,067
Stop standing behind me!

718
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,546
I found your weakness…

719
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:23,491
I'm gonna throw you into
the exact spot I pissed in!

720
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:26,960
Take this! It's my Water Style!

721
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,972
Disgusting! Don't whip it around!

722
00:47:30,955 --> 00:47:34,251
<i>Each time we met,
we became closer friends.</i>

723
00:47:40,598 --> 00:47:41,599
Madara…

724
00:47:41,642 --> 00:47:43,691
I came up with an amazing jutsu!

725
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,821
Let's master it together!

726
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,907
Really? Show me.

727
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:50,250
A secret taijutsu technique,

728
00:47:50,275 --> 00:47:53,612
a Super Fire Style Genjutsu Slice
Giant Shuriken Two-Step Drop Jutsu!

729
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,880
Nope...I can't visualize it at all.

730
00:47:56,582 --> 00:48:00,127
I mean, which is it?
Taijutsu or genjutsu?

731
00:48:00,702 --> 00:48:03,204
In the first place,
the name is too long!

732
00:48:03,871 --> 00:48:05,274
Who can remember such
a long name?

733
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:07,442
Well, let me explain it...

734
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:08,802
Never mind!

735
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:11,078
Today, I'm challenging you
to cliff climbing!

736
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:15,358
Quit getting depressed
all the time!

737
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:17,352
That's your weakness.

738
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:21,189
And your weakness is
to judge too quickly…

739
00:48:22,607 --> 00:48:27,278
I'm just psyching you out…
before cliff climbing!

740
00:48:27,403 --> 00:48:28,738
Huh? Hey you!

741
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,158
See you later!

742
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:33,035
You were just pretending, huh?!

743
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:38,498
I win…

744
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:42,544
That's to be expected…
You started before me!

745
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,931
What a sweeping view of the forest!

746
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:56,850
Yeah, you can see really far!

747
00:48:57,726 --> 00:49:00,228
I know my eyesight's just
as good as yours.

748
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:01,688
Want to challenge me?

749
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,732
What makes you say
that all of a sudden?

750
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:06,026
You sound really proud
of your eyes.

751
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:09,071
Well sure! I have Sha…

752
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,701
What's the matter?

753
00:49:15,076 --> 00:49:18,371
No…never mind.
I guess it's not all that.

754
00:49:18,704 --> 00:49:21,957
What is it? You're being awful
candid for once.

755
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:25,337
If I were better,
my siblings wouldn't be dead.

756
00:49:26,487 --> 00:49:28,489
I couldn't even protect them.

757
00:49:29,791 --> 00:49:32,878
So I shouldn't...shouldn't...

758
00:49:35,046 --> 00:49:36,047
Madara…

759
00:49:44,138 --> 00:49:45,139
Sorry…

760
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:48,777
I brought back some memories
for you too, huh.

761
00:49:50,645 --> 00:49:53,690
So…you don't have
any more siblings?

762
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:57,411
No...I have
one younger brother left.

763
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:03,458
And I'll protect him,
no matter what!

764
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:07,170
What about you?

765
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:09,297
I have one brother left too.

766
00:50:09,931 --> 00:50:12,683
And I intend to protect him too,
no matter what.

767
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:19,266
I've decided!
Let's build our settlement here!

768
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:20,308
Huh?

769
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:24,271
And make it so kids won't
have to kill each other!

770
00:50:24,528 --> 00:50:28,908
We'll create a school where kids
can train and grow up stronger!

771
00:50:29,467 --> 00:50:33,012
Assign missions that fit an
individual's abilities and strengths!

772
00:50:33,438 --> 00:50:37,401
Have superiors who can properly
assign ranks to commissions!

773
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:39,870
It will be a place where kids

774
00:50:39,895 --> 00:50:41,772
don't have to be sent
into harsh battlefronts.

775
00:50:43,089 --> 00:50:46,234
You're pretty much
the only one spouting nonsense.

776
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,336
Well then, what about you?

777
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:51,022
It doesn't sound bad at all.

778
00:50:51,297 --> 00:50:52,715
Then it's decided!

779
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:55,636
Yeah...If that settlement
gets built here,

780
00:50:55,661 --> 00:50:57,538
then I could watch over
my little brother,

781
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:00,932
and protect him in this place
where you can see to no end!

782
00:51:07,004 --> 00:51:10,883
<i>That was where the Leaf Village
would eventually stand.</i>

783
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:15,072
<i>I made a resolution that day.</i>

784
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:19,242
<i>To endure for
the sake of my vision.</i>

785
00:51:24,965 --> 00:51:26,399
We both made it.

786
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:30,212
That stone…
is perfect for rock skipping.

787
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:33,548
Hang on to it until
we meet next time!

788
00:51:50,089 --> 00:51:51,298
What is it, Tobirama?

789
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:54,653
Older Brother...Come with me.

790
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:05,372
Hashirama, this boy you've been
meeting up with...

791
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:07,624
How did you…?

792
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:11,294
Father ordered me to tail you…

793
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:12,462
You?

794
00:52:12,721 --> 00:52:14,222
I have better sensory skills
than you.

795
00:52:16,348 --> 00:52:19,393
You've been going out
quite often lately,

796
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:22,139
so I knew something was up.

797
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:25,934
I checked up on that boy.

798
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:29,104
He belongs to the Uchiha Clan.

799
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:33,984
He has killed adults from our clan.

800
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:38,029
It seems he was born
with inherent shinobi talent.

801
00:52:40,014 --> 00:52:41,724
<i>So I was right…</i>

802
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:46,288
Given your lack of surprise...

803
00:52:47,113 --> 00:52:49,057
Don't tell me
the two of you already

804
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:50,801
knew each other's clan names.

805
00:52:50,826 --> 00:52:52,369
No...I didn't know.

806
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:54,713
He probably
doesn't know mine either.

807
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:56,047
Hashirama.

808
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:58,967
Do you know what this means?

809
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:05,015
The Senju and Uchiha Clans
are bitter enemies.

810
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:08,476
I haven't told anyone
in our clan yet…

811
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:13,481
If we're not careful,
you could be branded a traitor.

812
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,693
If you don't want to be accused
of being an enemy spy…

813
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:21,406
after you see that boy next time,
follow him.

814
00:53:21,664 --> 00:53:24,251
And bring back intel
about the Uchiha Clan.

815
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:26,036
This is a mission.

816
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:28,872
If he should notice you...

817
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:31,666
kill him!

818
00:53:40,351 --> 00:53:41,551
W-Wait...

819
00:53:42,077 --> 00:53:44,329
A-Are you sure he's an Uchiha?

820
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:45,805
Yes...

821
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:48,443
If he's found out that you're Senju,

822
00:53:48,583 --> 00:53:52,003
he'll pretend to let his guard down
to steal intel on us.

823
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,113
Do not trust him.

824
00:53:54,589 --> 00:53:56,382
No, he's not like that...

825
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:00,528
You'd trust the clan who killed
your younger brother?

826
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:06,660
You have no idea what
he's thinking inside his gut!

827
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:11,248
If he tricks you, you'll be putting
the entire Senju Clan at risk.

828
00:54:11,297 --> 00:54:12,298
That's not...

829
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:16,210
Just in case, Tobirama and I
will come along. Understood?

830
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:18,797
Answer me!

831
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:20,757
Yes.

832
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,043
I know it's right off the bat,

833
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,754
but how about we just skip stones
instead of exchanging greetings?

834
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:01,006
Yeah...

835
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:18,064
Hashirama...

836
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,309
Sorry. I can't stay today...

837
00:55:21,008 --> 00:55:22,593
I just remembered something
I have to do.

838
00:55:24,703 --> 00:55:28,791
O-Oh yeah?
I'm going to head home then.

839
00:55:36,156 --> 00:55:38,409
That speed!
He's planning to run for it!

840
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:40,378
Damn Hashirama!
He warned him!

841
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:42,121
Let's go, Tobirama!

842
00:55:42,412 --> 00:55:43,413
Yes!

843
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:56,102
Seems like we're both
on the same page.

844
00:55:56,127 --> 00:55:57,128
Butsuma Senju.

845
00:55:57,562 --> 00:55:59,189
And Tobirama, I believe.

846
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:02,574
Indeed, Tajima Uchiha.

847
00:56:03,083 --> 00:56:04,460
And Izuna, right?

848
00:56:09,865 --> 00:56:13,369
<i>It seemed the Uchiha coincidentally
had the same idea.</i>

849
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:16,206
<i>Exactly the same circumstances.</i>

850
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:22,754
<i>Butsuma Senju and Tajima Uchiha
both knew from numerous prior clashes</i>

851
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:25,632
<i>that they possessed
practically equal strength.</i>

852
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:32,430
- Stop!
- Stop!

853
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:39,003
<i>Shinobi are trained to keep
their hearts in check on the battlefield,</i>

854
00:56:39,028 --> 00:56:40,071
<i>no matter what happens.</i>

855
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:43,900
<i>A single flash of emotional display
can lead to vulnerability</i>

856
00:56:44,133 --> 00:56:46,427
<i>and mean the difference
between life and death.</i>

857
00:56:46,852 --> 00:56:47,853
<i>However...</i>

858
00:56:48,755 --> 00:56:50,965
<i>The two adults were well aware...</i>

859
00:56:51,716 --> 00:56:54,218
<i>that if their own child were killed
right before their eyes,</i>

860
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:59,165
<i>it would likely, no matter how slight,
unbalance their heart.</i>

861
00:57:00,074 --> 00:57:01,092
<i>Meaning...</i>

862
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:04,763
<i>whoever could land the first strike
would determine the outcome.</i>

863
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:25,090
I'll never forgive anyone who tries
to hurt my little brother,

864
00:57:25,115 --> 00:57:26,507
no matter who they are!

865
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,290
Same here!

866
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:34,033
Hey, Hashirama...

867
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:35,243
What is it?

868
00:57:36,335 --> 00:57:39,338
Maybe it just isn't possible for us...

869
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:41,749
to reach that...

870
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:46,379
pipe dream of ours...

871
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:49,382
Madara...What are you...?

872
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:53,895
It may have been brief,
but it was fun...Hashirama.

873
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:57,599
Three against three...

874
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,768
Can we take them, Madara?

875
00:58:00,851 --> 00:58:01,478
No...

876
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:03,188
Hashirama is stronger than me.

877
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:05,732
If we fight, we'll lose.

878
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:07,734
There's a kid stronger than you, Brother?

879
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:10,403
I see, quite impressive.

880
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:12,947
Let's retreat!

881
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:14,282
So long.

882
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:16,159
Madara!

883
00:58:16,341 --> 00:58:19,970
You...really haven't given up, have you?

884
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:22,707
You've gotten to the same point I...

885
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,209
You are Senju.

886
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:27,587
I truly wish it wasn't so.

887
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:31,216
My brothers were killed
by the Senju.

888
00:58:31,874 --> 00:58:34,502
And your brothers, by the Uchiha...

889
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:43,269
So there's no need to show
our guts to each other.

890
00:58:44,445 --> 00:58:47,532
Our next meeting will likely be
on the battlefield...

891
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,734
Hashirama Senju.

892
00:58:51,927 --> 00:58:55,222
I'm...Madara Uchiha.

893
00:58:55,915 --> 00:58:58,293
Father! Look at Big Brother's eyes!

894
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:02,997
We may not have obtained
any intel on the Senju...

895
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:06,167
but it seems we gained something
valuable from this, after all.

896
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:10,921
He awakened his Sharingan...just now?

897
00:59:14,542 --> 00:59:15,960
<i>In that moment,</i>

898
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:20,932
<i>I felt like I understood what awakening
the Sharingan truly signified.</i>

899
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:31,025
<i>He decided to completely
erase his friend.</i>

900
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:33,236
<i>To erase me from his life.</i>

901
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:42,078
<i>After that, we battled.
We fought each other day after day.</i>

902
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:43,413
<i>And before we knew it,</i>

903
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:46,958
<i>we'd each become
our respective clan's leaders.</i>

904
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:57,302
<i>We were at the furthest place possible...</i>

905
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:00,597
<i>from the dream that
we wanted to fulfill.</i>

906
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:34,464
<i>Fire Style:</i>

907
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:35,840
<i>Fire Ball Jutsu!</i>

908
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:37,701
<i>Water Style:
Water Dragon Missile!</i>

909
01:00:52,773 --> 01:00:54,316
<i>A blind attack...</i>

910
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:57,653
<i>I curse the misfortune of the ones
who do not have the Sharingan.</i>

911
01:01:00,063 --> 01:01:01,273
<i>Flying Raijin Slice!</i>

912
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:08,498
Izuna!

913
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,001
Hang in there!

914
01:01:12,351 --> 01:01:13,310
I swear I'll save you!

915
01:01:26,289 --> 01:01:27,491
Hashirama...

916
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:32,438
Madara...You cannot defeat me.

917
01:01:34,098 --> 01:01:37,059
<i>But I had never abandoned our dream.</i>

918
01:01:42,748 --> 01:01:45,167
Why don't we end this?

919
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:49,247
If the two strongest shinobi clans,
the Uchiha and Senju, join forces,

920
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:53,376
nations will not be able to find other
shinobi clans that can stand against us...

921
01:01:54,176 --> 01:01:56,345
The conflict will eventually
start to die down.

922
01:01:57,963 --> 01:01:58,973
Come on.

923
01:02:17,316 --> 01:02:18,651
No...Big Brother...

924
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:20,236
Izuna!

925
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,865
Do not be deceived by them...

926
01:02:24,982 --> 01:02:25,983
Izuna!

927
01:02:26,475 --> 01:02:32,147
Have you forgotten that these bastards
killed everyone...killed the Uchiha?

928
01:03:09,777 --> 01:03:15,074
<i>It was clear to all that the Uchiha Clan
was in an unfavorable position.</i>

929
01:03:15,941 --> 01:03:20,004
<i>In fact, defectors to the Senju
soon began showing up.</i>

930
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:32,099
<i>And that's about when
Madara changed as well.</i>

931
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:36,604
<i>He had obtained
the Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan.</i>

932
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:38,014
Those eyes...

933
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:40,316
What happened to Izuna?

934
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:43,986
My little brother ended up dying
from that day's wounds...

935
01:03:45,045 --> 01:03:48,173
Leaving me powers that
will help protect the Uchiha!

936
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,536
I sent you a cease-fire agreement!

937
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:55,665
If you truly want to protect the Uchiha,
let's stop fighting!

938
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:03,381
Hashirama!

939
01:04:11,188 --> 01:04:13,899
<i>Wood Style: Deep Forest Bloom!</i>

940
01:04:47,574 --> 01:04:49,117
Poison Pollen eh?

941
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:51,053
Enough, Madara!

942
01:04:51,962 --> 01:04:53,714
Fighting is meaningless!

943
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:56,100
Meaningless?

944
01:04:57,076 --> 01:04:59,093
Then why did Izuna die?

945
01:05:00,922 --> 01:05:05,176
It's because...
because you bastards killed him!

946
01:05:31,210 --> 01:05:32,378
<i>Wood Golem Jutsu!</i>

947
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:58,621
Hashirama!

948
01:07:07,081 --> 01:07:09,640
Madara, we were friends!

949
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:12,570
And we shared the same dream!

950
01:07:17,241 --> 01:07:18,242
Hashirama!

951
01:07:19,076 --> 01:07:21,120
How long will you keep saying
such juvenile things?

952
01:07:33,507 --> 01:07:36,352
It's just not possible to show
our guts to each other!

953
01:07:36,377 --> 01:07:37,969
Don't you get it?

954
01:07:43,967 --> 01:07:45,277
Hashirama!

955
01:07:45,452 --> 01:07:46,953
Madara!

956
01:08:03,678 --> 01:08:05,931
<i>At the end of a battle
that lasted a whole day...</i>

957
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:09,126
<i>Madara's back touched
the ground for the very first time.</i>

958
01:08:22,589 --> 01:08:23,632
Madara...

959
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:24,975
You're finished.

960
01:08:25,726 --> 01:08:26,727
Wait, Tobirama.

961
01:08:31,574 --> 01:08:32,575
Why, Elder Brother?!

962
01:08:33,242 --> 01:08:34,368
This is our chance!

963
01:08:35,118 --> 01:08:36,355
No one touches him!

964
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:42,543
Just get it over with, Hashirama.

965
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:48,249
It would be an honor to die
by your hand.

966
01:08:49,158 --> 01:08:50,558
Stop posturing.

967
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:53,003
If I kill the clan leader of the Uchiha,

968
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:56,298
it will only incite the young ones
who follow you.

969
01:08:56,549 --> 01:09:00,636
There isn't anyone left with such pluck
among the Uchiha anymore.

970
01:09:01,202 --> 01:09:02,495
Sure there are.

971
01:09:03,271 --> 01:09:06,233
Perhaps not right now, but in time.

972
01:09:06,651 --> 01:09:10,135
Come on...
Why don't we end this war?

973
01:09:11,571 --> 01:09:13,115
We made a promise, remember?

974
01:09:13,823 --> 01:09:15,950
To create the ideal village someday.

975
01:09:18,069 --> 01:09:22,574
Can't we go back to those days...
and skip rocks together?

976
01:09:23,908 --> 01:09:25,744
That's just impossible.

977
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:29,665
You and I are no longer the same.

978
01:09:30,716 --> 01:09:32,801
<i>Let's build our settlement here!</i>

979
01:09:33,234 --> 01:09:37,321
<i>Heh...You're pretty much the only one
spouting such nonsense.</i>

980
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,266
<i>Well then, what about you?</i>

981
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:42,970
<i>Yeah...If that settlement gets built here,</i>

982
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:45,097
<i>then I could watch over
my little brother,</i>

983
01:09:45,389 --> 01:09:48,601
<i>and protect him in this place
where you can see to no end!</i>

984
01:09:49,851 --> 01:09:53,896
I don't have a single brother left.

985
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:56,567
I have nothing to protect.

986
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:00,779
And...I just can't trust you.

987
01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:05,084
Is there any way I can
convince you to trust us?

988
01:10:10,497 --> 01:10:13,667
Well, there is a way to
show each other our guts...

989
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:16,837
Either kill your brother...

990
01:10:17,671 --> 01:10:19,715
or kill yourself right now.

991
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:25,179
And then we'll be even.
I'd be willing to trust your clan.

992
01:10:25,588 --> 01:10:28,224
Kill your little brother or kill yourself?

993
01:10:28,758 --> 01:10:30,935
How dare you say
something so ridicu-

994
01:10:31,685 --> 01:10:32,811
I agree.

995
01:10:33,187 --> 01:10:34,605
This is crazy!

996
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:36,899
So what are you going
to do, Elder Brother?

997
01:10:36,924 --> 01:10:38,467
Are you going to kill me now?

998
01:10:38,950 --> 01:10:41,828
Or are you going to die on account
of this guy's nonsense?

999
01:10:42,387 --> 01:10:45,030
It's idiotic. Don't listen to him!

1000
01:10:49,961 --> 01:10:51,337
Thank you, Madara.

1001
01:10:52,256 --> 01:10:54,500
You really are kindhearted.

1002
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:59,289
<i>Madara had given me a choice,</i>

1003
01:10:59,496 --> 01:11:02,263
<i>an option where I wouldn't have
to kill my little brother.</i>

1004
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,444
<i>He knew all too well...</i>

1005
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:07,846
<i>how an older brother feels
towards his younger siblings.</i>

1006
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:10,140
Listen, Tobirama...

1007
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:14,103
Etch these words into your heart,
for these are my final words...

1008
01:11:14,436 --> 01:11:15,422
Brother...

1009
01:11:16,371 --> 01:11:18,332
Words that I shall be exchanging
with my life.

1010
01:11:18,765 --> 01:11:20,600
You too, my fellow clan members.

1011
01:11:22,152 --> 01:11:25,030
After my death, do not kill Madara.

1012
01:11:25,505 --> 01:11:28,542
I forbid any fighting between
the Uchiha and Senju.

1013
01:11:29,475 --> 01:11:30,560
Swear this right now...

1014
01:11:30,811 --> 01:11:33,491
upon the lives of your fathers,
and your grandchildren yet unborn.

1015
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:38,252
Farewell...

1016
01:12:09,683 --> 01:12:10,809
Enough...

1017
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:14,163
I have now seen your guts.

1018
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,400
<i>It was like a dream...</i>

1019
01:12:20,493 --> 01:12:23,037
<i>The Uchiha and the Senju
formed an alliance.</i>

1020
01:12:23,255 --> 01:12:26,216
<i>There would no longer
be any casualties,</i>

1021
01:12:26,774 --> 01:12:28,761
<i>nor would any more children
have to die.</i>

1022
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:36,143
<i>And so, we began building our village.</i>

1023
01:12:38,561 --> 01:12:40,956
<i>Later, we would ally
with the Land of Fire,</i>

1024
01:12:41,189 --> 01:12:43,699
<i>and the creation of
a peaceful state</i>

1025
01:12:43,724 --> 01:12:46,512
<i>where nation and village stood
on equal footing also commenced.</i>

1026
01:12:49,573 --> 01:12:51,241
<i>In any case, it was like a dream.</i>

1027
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:06,673
I thought we were just talking
about our dream.

1028
01:13:08,759 --> 01:13:11,553
They say where there's a will,
there's a way...

1029
01:13:11,953 --> 01:13:13,037
And yet, I...

1030
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:15,182
That dream is now becoming reality.

1031
01:13:16,266 --> 01:13:18,977
The leader of shinobi who protects
the Land of Fire from the shadows.

1032
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:21,647
The Fire Shadow, or Hokage. Well?

1033
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:22,981
What's that supposed to be?

1034
01:13:23,273 --> 01:13:26,527
The Land of Fire requests that we select
someone who will represent the Village.

1035
01:13:27,694 --> 01:13:31,156
I'm considering naming you
to be our leader...the Hokage.

1036
01:13:32,766 --> 01:13:34,893
You no longer have any siblings left...

1037
01:13:34,918 --> 01:13:38,838
But I'd like you to think of all of
the village shinobi as your siblings.

1038
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:42,298
I want you to protect them
with all your might.

1039
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:48,340
Even though I couldn't protect
my own Uchiha brethren?

1040
01:13:51,951 --> 01:13:53,995
There's no time to
get weak right now!

1041
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:57,324
In addition to the Uchiha and Senju,

1042
01:13:57,599 --> 01:14:01,228
it seems the Sarutobi and
the Shimura Clans also want to join.

1043
01:14:03,464 --> 01:14:06,166
Are you kidding? Are you serious?!

1044
01:14:06,191 --> 01:14:07,985
And there are many others!

1045
01:14:08,068 --> 01:14:10,404
This village is going to
keep on expanding!

1046
01:14:10,963 --> 01:14:13,507
We're going to need to come up
with a name for the village too...

1047
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:15,451
Any thoughts?

1048
01:14:26,386 --> 01:14:27,512
How about...

1049
01:14:27,596 --> 01:14:30,349
The Village...Hidden in the Leaves?

1050
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:35,053
It's too simple...
It's not imaginative.

1051
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:36,555
You called it exactly as you saw it.

1052
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:38,640
How's it different from "Hokage"?!

1053
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:42,102
And you still have that habit
of getting depressed easily!

1054
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:45,605
<i>It took a long time, but it felt like</i>

1055
01:14:45,630 --> 01:14:48,214
<i>we were back to being
the friends we once were.</i>

1056
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:52,921
So you're saying
the role of the Hokage

1057
01:14:52,946 --> 01:14:56,241
is to stay in the village
and protect everyone?

1058
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:58,243
There's that...

1059
01:14:58,243 --> 01:15:00,370
But he'll be even more significant.

1060
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:05,501
As village-building picks up speed,
the Hokage will get busier too.

1061
01:15:06,627 --> 01:15:08,837
That's why I want to
have your likeness

1062
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:11,173
carved into this cliff at our feet.

1063
01:15:12,549 --> 01:15:14,801
As a symbol of
our village's protector!

1064
01:15:17,262 --> 01:15:18,521
You've got to be kidding!

1065
01:15:19,323 --> 01:15:20,991
Although...your face is a bit too stern...

1066
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:23,268
so it will have to be softened
here and there.

1067
01:15:23,268 --> 01:15:26,313
Well, it beats that sad mug of yours!

1068
01:15:27,564 --> 01:15:29,608
Is it that sad?

1069
01:15:31,443 --> 01:15:34,321
Yeah...It's beyond sad.

1070
01:15:35,155 --> 01:15:36,239
Is that so?

1071
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:39,960
There you are!

1072
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:42,637
What are you dawdling here for?

1073
01:15:43,497 --> 01:15:46,500
The Feudal Lords from the Land of Fire
will be here soon for the conference!

1074
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:47,876
It's Tobirama...

1075
01:15:59,471 --> 01:16:00,472
For Hokage?!

1076
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:02,975
That's not your choice!

1077
01:16:03,767 --> 01:16:06,520
To propose Madara as
a candidate for leader is fine...

1078
01:16:07,537 --> 01:16:10,165
But the final decision will be made
with the top officials,

1079
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:12,901
after consulting with the Land of Fire
and the people of the village!

1080
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:14,695
Things are different from Father's era!

1081
01:16:15,612 --> 01:16:16,421
But...

1082
01:16:16,446 --> 01:16:20,117
Besides, Madara Uchiha being chosen
as the leader won't happen.

1083
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:22,077
Everyone knows...

1084
01:16:22,735 --> 01:16:25,405
You are the one who founded
this settlement, Big Brother.

1085
01:16:26,206 --> 01:16:28,875
Even those from
the Uchiha say as much.

1086
01:16:29,793 --> 01:16:33,297
Furthermore, haven't you heard
the rumors about them?

1087
01:16:34,689 --> 01:16:36,284
The stronger their hate,

1088
01:16:36,407 --> 01:16:38,859
the stronger their visual prowess
manifests itself.

1089
01:16:39,436 --> 01:16:40,812
The Sharingan is such a power.

1090
01:16:41,846 --> 01:16:44,182
They're unpredictable.

1091
01:16:45,075 --> 01:16:46,285
For the future of the village...

1092
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:48,186
Stop talking like that, Tobirama!

1093
01:17:04,293 --> 01:17:06,295
I just felt someone's presence.

1094
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:09,625
Tobirama, you would know.

1095
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:13,045
No...I'm not infusing chakra right now.

1096
01:17:13,311 --> 01:17:15,120
Don't change the subject, Big Brother!

1097
01:17:24,389 --> 01:17:27,225
From now on,
things will be run democratically.

1098
01:17:27,559 --> 01:17:28,935
Any objections?

1099
01:17:29,728 --> 01:17:31,229
No...That's fine.

1100
01:17:36,158 --> 01:17:39,120
<i>And so...
I became the First Hokage.</i>

1101
01:17:41,381 --> 01:17:44,467
This is the stone tablet that has been
passed down the Uchiha for generations.

1102
01:17:44,951 --> 01:17:46,912
It's never been shown
to an outsider before.

1103
01:17:47,245 --> 01:17:51,124
The special text requires
visual prowess to decipher.

1104
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:56,338
This is what I'm able
to decipher so far...

1105
01:17:57,464 --> 01:18:01,510
"One god seeking stability
split into light and shadow.

1106
01:18:01,968 --> 01:18:03,929
"And it is these opposites together
that give rise

1107
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:05,639
"to all things in this universe."

1108
01:18:07,716 --> 01:18:09,802
This is a universal truth.

1109
01:18:10,919 --> 01:18:14,966
In short, it states that
true happiness can be found

1110
01:18:15,182 --> 01:18:17,499
when two contrary powers
cooperate together.

1111
01:18:18,417 --> 01:18:20,878
However, it could be
interpreted differently.

1112
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:26,576
Hashirama...

1113
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:28,453
Do you think I don't know
what's going on?

1114
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:33,375
Leave Tobirama to me.
I can't do this without you.

1115
01:18:34,334 --> 01:18:38,130
Help me as the Hokage's right hand...
and as a brother!

1116
01:18:39,339 --> 01:18:41,717
The people will eventually
recognize your merits!

1117
01:18:42,449 --> 01:18:44,218
And then,
I'll name you Second Hokage.

1118
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:48,181
After you, I suspect Tobirama
will probably become the Hokage.

1119
01:18:49,474 --> 01:18:51,977
When he does, the Uchiha
will be eventually eliminated.

1120
01:18:52,688 --> 01:18:57,442
Knowing this, I've reached out to
other Uchiha about leaving the village.

1121
01:18:57,950 --> 01:19:00,318
But it seems no one is willing
to follow me.

1122
01:19:01,378 --> 01:19:02,379
Madara...

1123
01:19:03,554 --> 01:19:05,515
I couldn't protect
my younger brother...

1124
01:19:06,382 --> 01:19:09,051
And it seems I won't be able
to keep the promise I made him...

1125
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:10,744
that I would protect the clan.

1126
01:19:11,997 --> 01:19:14,750
I'm not even trusted
by the clan I want to protect.

1127
01:19:15,375 --> 01:19:16,527
That's not true!

1128
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:17,594
Everyone is...

1129
01:19:17,619 --> 01:19:20,188
Perhaps that time, the ultimatum
I should have given you was

1130
01:19:20,213 --> 01:19:22,048
"to kill your younger brother."

1131
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:25,677
You call me your brother.

1132
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:28,847
But which of us would you kill
for the sake of the village?

1133
01:19:34,185 --> 01:19:36,604
I'd like to think that
I know you pretty well.

1134
01:19:37,388 --> 01:19:38,681
I've had enough.

1135
01:19:40,317 --> 01:19:41,902
I'm going to leave the village.

1136
01:19:43,436 --> 01:19:45,563
I've found a different path to take.

1137
01:19:46,439 --> 01:19:48,858
It became clear to me because
we showed each other our guts...

1138
01:19:49,658 --> 01:19:53,078
Cooperation is merely
a quiet form of conflict.

1139
01:19:53,705 --> 01:19:54,772
You're wrong!

1140
01:19:55,165 --> 01:19:56,625
I won't let it be like that.

1141
01:19:57,459 --> 01:19:59,836
Hashirama, it's what
you make of reality.

1142
01:20:00,837 --> 01:20:02,839
Let's stop being slaves to it.

1143
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:07,385
It's healthier to view this world
as merely a sideshow...

1144
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:10,055
Have you been listening
to me, Madara?!

1145
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:13,574
You are the only one
who's an even match for me.

1146
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:19,481
I'm looking forward
to the battles we'll fight...

1147
01:20:19,564 --> 01:20:22,192
up until the time
I achieve my true dream.

1148
01:20:30,534 --> 01:20:32,160
What is your true dream?

1149
01:20:33,111 --> 01:20:36,198
I thought everything we've aimed for
is here in this village!

1150
01:20:37,123 --> 01:20:38,875
You just can't see it...

1151
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:43,171
What's beyond this...
The dreams of the far future.

1152
01:20:48,218 --> 01:20:51,137
Then tell me about your dreams
of the far future.

1153
01:20:52,556 --> 01:20:54,699
If it's connected to
this village's dreams,

1154
01:20:54,724 --> 01:20:58,403
I need your strength as a leader,
as a senior member.

1155
01:20:59,178 --> 01:21:01,514
And...as a friend.

1156
01:21:05,335 --> 01:21:06,577
There is no connection.

1157
01:21:07,487 --> 01:21:09,656
And you'll never reach it.

1158
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:13,034
Chasing after me is useless.

1159
01:21:13,785 --> 01:21:15,495
You, of all people, should know.

1160
01:21:15,996 --> 01:21:18,915
No one is capable of
catching me from behind.

1161
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:25,588
<i>Upon saying those words,
Madara left the village.</i>

1162
01:21:42,647 --> 01:21:44,858
<i>We had come this far together.</i>

1163
01:21:45,634 --> 01:21:49,387
<i>And now, Madara was gone from
the village we had created together.</i>

1164
01:21:52,391 --> 01:21:53,767
<i>But in the world,</i>

1165
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:58,364
<i>everyone respected and copied
our village system of Allied Ninja Clans</i>

1166
01:21:58,572 --> 01:22:00,348
<i>which had been created</i>

1167
01:22:00,373 --> 01:22:04,002
<i>by the former warring rivals,
the Uchiha and Senju, joining forces.</i>

1168
01:22:06,488 --> 01:22:08,231
<i>Villages like the Village Hidden
in the Leaves</i>

1169
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:11,819
<i>which began in the Land of Fire,
and its one leader system,</i>

1170
01:22:12,069 --> 01:22:14,429
<i>spread like wildfire across
the Great Nations.</i>

1171
01:22:15,731 --> 01:22:16,865
<i>In the Land of Lightning,</i>

1172
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:20,477
<i>Hidden Cloud Village was formed
with its leader named Raikage.</i>

1173
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:22,354
<i>In the Land of Earth,</i>

1174
01:22:22,437 --> 01:22:25,857
<i>Hidden Stone Village was formed
with its leader named Tsuchikage.</i>

1175
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:31,388
<i>The Land of Water had the Hidden Mist
with their Mizukage.</i>

1176
01:22:31,988 --> 01:22:33,140
<i>And in the Land of Wind,</i>

1177
01:22:33,165 --> 01:22:37,657
<i>the Hidden Sand was formed and
they named their leader, Kazekage.</i>

1178
01:22:38,495 --> 01:22:39,996
<i>Not only the Great Nations,</i>

1179
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:42,940
<i>but even the smaller nations
adopted this system.</i>

1180
01:22:43,492 --> 01:22:46,086
<i>Madara's and my dream had come true.</i>

1181
01:22:51,081 --> 01:22:57,004
<i>Shinobi children learned
and played instead of battling.</i>

1182
01:22:57,421 --> 01:23:00,424
<i>And they started living long enough
to even know the taste of alcohol.</i>

1183
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:05,939
<i>But, as if he wanted to destroy
his previous dream...</i>

1184
01:23:06,022 --> 01:23:08,434
<i>Madara came back to
attack the Leaf Village.</i>

1185
01:23:13,345 --> 01:23:14,346
<i>Wood Style:</i>

1186
01:23:15,748 --> 01:23:16,957
<i>Wood Golem jutsu!</i>

1187
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:50,316
The Wood Style Wood
Expulsion Jutsu, was it?

1188
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:52,986
Perfect for taking on
difficult beasts...

1189
01:23:56,531 --> 01:24:00,201
<i>He clad his Susano'o around
the Tailed Beast like armor!</i>

1190
01:24:00,743 --> 01:24:02,778
<i>Madara, you crafty fox!</i>

1191
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:08,001
I can read your sword swings!

1192
01:24:09,085 --> 01:24:11,254
<i>Wood Style:
Laughing Buddha Jutsu!</i>

1193
01:24:23,683 --> 01:24:25,894
<i>At this rate, this land
will be completely obliterated.</i>

1194
01:24:26,186 --> 01:24:28,021
<i>It's best to move this
to the seashore!</i>

1195
01:24:31,107 --> 01:24:32,233
You're not getting away!

1196
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:43,078
There, try grabbing that!

1197
01:24:43,995 --> 01:24:45,080
What will you do now?!

1198
01:24:45,121 --> 01:24:46,247
<i>Summoning...</i>

1199
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:48,333
<i>Five-Layer Rashomon!</i>

1200
01:24:51,919 --> 01:24:52,920
<i>This...</i>

1201
01:24:53,070 --> 01:24:54,697
<i>will change the trajectory!</i>

1202
01:24:59,777 --> 01:25:00,987
<i>All the way to the other shore?</i>

1203
01:25:10,355 --> 01:25:11,523
Hashirama...

1204
01:25:12,065 --> 01:25:14,943
It's been a while since we've
fought each other earnestly!

1205
01:25:15,735 --> 01:25:18,113
You can see that I have changed!

1206
01:25:20,532 --> 01:25:24,702
Will you destroy everything that
we've accomplished until now, Madara?

1207
01:25:25,703 --> 01:25:28,540
Nothing will come of us
battling each other.

1208
01:25:28,665 --> 01:25:32,127
This fight will only...
hurt the village and shinobi!

1209
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:37,048
It is disrespect toward
our siblings and our comrades!

1210
01:25:37,564 --> 01:25:39,883
You know nothing...

1211
01:25:40,385 --> 01:25:42,345
I don't want to kill you!

1212
01:25:42,846 --> 01:25:45,640
Are you implying that
you could kill me at any moment?

1213
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:48,268
No! I'm saying we are friends...

1214
01:25:48,726 --> 01:25:51,521
I've already...reached it!

1215
01:25:55,483 --> 01:25:56,734
Then so be it!

1216
01:25:57,819 --> 01:25:59,279
<i>Sage Art!</i>

1217
01:26:00,047 --> 01:26:01,072
<i>Wood Style:</i>

1218
01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:03,408
<i>Shinsu Senju
Veritable 1000-Armed Kan'on!</i>

1219
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:07,412
Here I come, Madara!

1220
01:26:07,495 --> 01:26:08,997
Come, Hashirama!

1221
01:26:13,334 --> 01:26:15,670
<i>Chojo Kebutsu!
Artifacts of the Buddha!</i>

1222
01:27:02,926 --> 01:27:04,886
He stripped off the Susano'o!

1223
01:27:26,999 --> 01:27:28,034
Here I come!

1224
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:35,816
<i>10th Edict on Enlightenment!</i>

1225
01:28:07,665 --> 01:28:08,666
Madara!

1226
01:28:08,991 --> 01:28:11,243
Hashirama!

1227
01:28:37,478 --> 01:28:38,479
This time...

1228
01:28:38,938 --> 01:28:40,523
you're not going to
reach the other side!

1229
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:05,089
I'm the one still standing.

1230
01:29:06,382 --> 01:29:07,925
Opposite from the last time.

1231
01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:11,512
I just want to protect...

1232
01:29:12,638 --> 01:29:14,140
the dream I finally realized.

1233
01:29:14,364 --> 01:29:16,825
I don't want anymore...

1234
01:29:18,728 --> 01:29:22,106
You look pretty depressed, Hashirama.

1235
01:29:23,107 --> 01:29:25,318
Can't perk back up this time, eh?

1236
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:36,788
<i>Can't we show each other
our guts?</i>

1237
01:29:37,038 --> 01:29:39,624
<i>The first steps are for us to
not give up on our ideals</i>

1238
01:29:39,823 --> 01:29:42,075
<i>and to get a lot stronger.</i>

1239
01:29:42,752 --> 01:29:44,962
<i>Let's build our settlement here!</i>

1240
01:29:48,891 --> 01:29:51,936
<i>They say where there's a will,
there's a way...</i>

1241
01:29:52,136 --> 01:29:53,137
<i>And yet, I...</i>

1242
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:55,473
<i>That dream is now becoming reality.</i>

1243
01:30:11,363 --> 01:30:13,866
A Wood Style Clone...

1244
01:30:15,201 --> 01:30:18,246
I can't believe my back was taken...

1245
01:30:18,538 --> 01:30:23,000
I will protect our...no, my village.

1246
01:30:23,918 --> 01:30:25,420
No matter what.

1247
01:30:26,170 --> 01:30:28,673
I still believe to this day
that protecting the village

1248
01:30:29,299 --> 01:30:34,178
will lead to the protection of
the people, shinobi, and children!

1249
01:30:35,087 --> 01:30:40,927
I will not forgive anyone
who threatens the village.

1250
01:30:41,227 --> 01:30:44,188
Be they a friend...sibling...
or even my own child...

1251
01:30:47,666 --> 01:30:50,210
You've changed...Hashirama.

1252
01:30:52,321 --> 01:30:55,283
<i>I made up my mind right then...</i>

1253
01:30:55,716 --> 01:30:59,553
<i>to endure in order to watch
over the present.</i>

1254
01:31:00,955 --> 01:31:02,707
You've got your priorities backwards.

1255
01:31:03,374 --> 01:31:07,503
Ultimately...It shall someday
lead the village to darkness.

1256
01:31:26,288 --> 01:31:30,209
<i>And thus...my battle with Madara
came to an end.</i>

1257
01:31:31,277 --> 01:31:34,489
I don't know how Madara
returned to life now.

1258
01:31:34,739 --> 01:31:37,283
I definitely killed my friend...

1259
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:39,285
For the sake of the village.

1260
01:31:40,953 --> 01:31:42,038
The village...

1261
01:31:42,947 --> 01:31:46,284
that Madara and I first envisioned...

1262
01:31:47,134 --> 01:31:49,762
is something that joined
one clan to another.

1263
01:31:50,230 --> 01:31:52,899
It was an invaluable cornerstone
that created order out of chaos,

1264
01:31:52,924 --> 01:31:55,635
then maintained it.

1265
01:31:56,861 --> 01:32:00,198
It protected the children and
averted pointless conflict.

1266
01:32:00,223 --> 01:32:02,350
It made peace a reality.

1267
01:32:03,059 --> 01:32:05,603
However...it gave rise to despair,

1268
01:32:05,886 --> 01:32:08,847
the kind that your brother Itachi
was forced to bear.

1269
01:32:11,133 --> 01:32:13,761
Perhaps what Madara said
was correct, after all.

1270
01:32:14,711 --> 01:32:17,256
Perhaps he foresaw
this state of affairs.

1271
01:32:18,366 --> 01:32:21,619
I am the shinobi who created
these circumstances.

1272
01:32:21,702 --> 01:32:26,582
Furthermore, I am also the one
who considered them acceptable.

1273
01:32:27,583 --> 01:32:31,420
I believe that shinobi are those
who endure for a purpose.

1274
01:32:31,712 --> 01:32:34,715
But depending on what that purpose is,
a shinobi can change.

1275
01:32:35,224 --> 01:32:37,393
Just as Madara...and I did.

1276
01:32:41,948 --> 01:32:43,382
Shinobi...

1277
01:32:44,892 --> 01:32:47,170
Shinobi are those who endure...

1278
01:32:48,213 --> 01:32:51,107
in order to achieve their goals.

1279
01:32:51,607 --> 01:32:54,526
For me, it was building a village.

1280
01:32:54,859 --> 01:32:57,553
But it seems Madara
found something else.

1281
01:32:58,072 --> 01:33:01,492
This plan of Madara's that
Orochimaru mentioned earlier...

1282
01:33:01,576 --> 01:33:03,578
To erase all the shinobi in this world...

1283
01:33:03,578 --> 01:33:06,914
I don't know what
that means in literal terms, but...

1284
01:33:08,349 --> 01:33:09,750
It's the Infinite Tsukuyomi

1285
01:33:10,251 --> 01:33:13,504
where village, shinobi,
and citizen are all irrelevant.

1286
01:33:14,463 --> 01:33:16,431
He intends to put everyone
under genjutsu

1287
01:33:16,757 --> 01:33:19,051
and manipulate them as he sees fit.

1288
01:33:19,826 --> 01:33:22,930
To negate everything that my older
brother, Madara's younger brother...

1289
01:33:23,639 --> 01:33:26,642
and all of you...

1290
01:33:28,334 --> 01:33:29,644
have tried to protect.

1291
01:33:41,105 --> 01:33:48,613
My older brother inherited your will
without even talking to you.

1292
01:33:50,583 --> 01:33:53,794
My older brother endured longer
and harder than you.

1293
01:33:55,094 --> 01:33:59,724
And died stating he was proud
to be Leaf shinobi.

1294
01:34:01,552 --> 01:34:04,179
Isn't it ironic that the shinobi who
understood you more than anyone else...

1295
01:34:04,204 --> 01:34:06,363
was from the Uchiha Clan?

1296
01:34:09,359 --> 01:34:11,069
Your brother was not the only one.

1297
01:34:12,605 --> 01:34:14,790
I had a subordinate
named Kagami Uchiha

1298
01:34:14,815 --> 01:34:16,951
who was much like your brother.

1299
01:34:17,617 --> 01:34:20,703
Second Hokage...I thought
you despised the Uchiha.

1300
01:34:21,296 --> 01:34:22,756
That's not entirely true.

1301
01:34:23,574 --> 01:34:25,559
I treated anyone who posed
a danger to the village,

1302
01:34:25,584 --> 01:34:29,668
no matter what clan they belonged to,
with extreme caution.

1303
01:34:30,790 --> 01:34:34,960
And there's no doubt that
the Uchiha Clan warranted my suspicions...

1304
01:34:35,936 --> 01:34:38,272
The Uchiha just happened
to be a clan

1305
01:34:38,297 --> 01:34:40,157
particularly disposed
to be considered as such.

1306
01:34:40,308 --> 01:34:42,568
But, it is also because
they could feel such deep love

1307
01:34:42,593 --> 01:34:44,387
that there were quite
a few Uchiha over the years

1308
01:34:44,387 --> 01:34:45,680
like your brother and Kagami...

1309
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:47,473
who could transcend
the boundaries of the clan

1310
01:34:47,515 --> 01:34:49,016
and devote themselves to the village.

1311
01:34:49,809 --> 01:34:51,435
My elder brother believed the village

1312
01:34:51,460 --> 01:34:54,629
was something that could
eliminate the framework of clans.

1313
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:58,984
Well, the reality is...
This wasn't so simple.

1314
01:35:00,569 --> 01:35:02,446
The idealism of
my elder brother Hashirama...

1315
01:35:02,571 --> 01:35:04,824
And the danger that Madara posed...

1316
01:35:05,365 --> 01:35:07,576
Mediating between these two things,

1317
01:35:07,785 --> 01:35:10,079
and protecting and
strengthening the village

1318
01:35:10,362 --> 01:35:12,407
were my duties as
the Second Hokage.

1319
01:35:16,293 --> 01:35:19,588
Shisui Uchiha was
a descendant of Kagami Uchiha.

1320
01:35:20,497 --> 01:35:23,792
He was a friend of
your older brother Itachi.

1321
01:35:25,110 --> 01:35:30,074
Many, including myself, embraced
the First Hokage's Will of Fire.

1322
01:35:30,641 --> 01:35:34,895
But perhaps, I was more naïve
than any other shinobi.

1323
01:35:35,204 --> 01:35:37,331
I wasn't able to continue
the Second Hokage's task

1324
01:35:37,356 --> 01:35:39,024
of village-building skillfully enough.

1325
01:35:39,499 --> 01:35:44,189
Which is how I ended up burdening Danzo
with the village's darkness.

1326
01:35:45,238 --> 01:35:47,741
I killed Danzo in vengeance.

1327
01:35:48,909 --> 01:35:52,054
Until the end, he spoke that
he would protect the village,

1328
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:53,873
no matter how dirty the means.

1329
01:35:55,708 --> 01:36:00,588
It seems I've failed miserably
time after time as the Hokage.

1330
01:36:01,137 --> 01:36:06,935
I guess I'm responsible for creating
the situation that exists now.

1331
01:36:07,694 --> 01:36:09,905
No...You're not to blame, Lord Third.

1332
01:36:10,139 --> 01:36:13,993
You did everything you could
for the sake of the village respectably.

1333
01:36:14,477 --> 01:36:17,730
I'm the one who died during
the Nine-Tails' attack on the village!

1334
01:36:18,689 --> 01:36:21,025
You had such high hopes for me
as the Hokage...

1335
01:36:22,359 --> 01:36:24,195
And I couldn't live up to them.

1336
01:36:25,277 --> 01:36:28,990
I'll say...After he passed over me
and picked you.

1337
01:36:29,508 --> 01:36:31,552
Everyone was so disappointed.

1338
01:36:32,369 --> 01:36:35,164
Lord Orochimaru...
You sound like you're pouting.

1339
01:36:36,606 --> 01:36:38,984
A little...since the Third Hokage
is right here.

1340
01:36:39,911 --> 01:36:43,647
Had I lived, perhaps I could
have helped to foil

1341
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:47,115
the Uchiha's plans for
a coup d'état much sooner...

1342
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:50,679
Now then...Sasuke...

1343
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:53,057
What will you do?

1344
01:36:54,716 --> 01:36:56,760
Will you destroy the village?

1345
01:36:58,479 --> 01:36:59,772
Or...

1346
01:37:06,770 --> 01:37:07,771
<i>Sorry, Sasuke...</i>

1347
01:37:08,405 --> 01:37:09,615
<i>Let's do it some other time.</i>

1348
01:37:09,999 --> 01:37:12,793
<i>Sorry, Sasuke. Let's do it next time...</i>

1349
01:37:15,621 --> 01:37:16,956
<i>You probably hate me, huh?</i>

1350
01:37:19,041 --> 01:37:22,378
<i>But, we only have each other
as siblings.</i>

1351
01:37:23,128 --> 01:37:25,907
<i>I'm always going to
be there for you,</i>

1352
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:28,643
<i>even if it's only as an obstacle
for you to overcome.</i>

1353
01:37:28,668 --> 01:37:30,378
<i>Even if you do hate me...</i>

1354
01:37:32,012 --> 01:37:33,681
<i>That's what big brothers are for.</i>

1355
01:37:37,768 --> 01:37:39,895
<i>You all suspect me?</i>

1356
01:37:53,967 --> 01:37:58,430
<i>There is no value in killing you now...
my foolish little brother.</i>

1357
01:37:59,164 --> 01:38:03,168
<i>If you wish to kill me,
resent me, hate me,</i>

1358
01:38:03,252 --> 01:38:06,589
<i>and survive...in obscurity.</i>

1359
01:38:13,903 --> 01:38:15,905
<i>I did what you said...</i>

1360
01:38:16,307 --> 01:38:18,851
<i>I resented you and hated you...</i>

1361
01:38:19,226 --> 01:38:23,146
<i>and I survived just so I...</i>

1362
01:38:23,856 --> 01:38:27,776
<i>so I could kill you!</i>

1363
01:38:34,533 --> 01:38:37,077
<i>I have no interest
in someone like you...</i>

1364
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:41,498
<i>You're weak,
because you don't have enough...</i>

1365
01:38:41,739 --> 01:38:43,032
<i>hate.</i>

1366
01:38:55,429 --> 01:38:59,642
<i>I always lied to you and
asked you to forgive me.</i>

1367
01:39:00,225 --> 01:39:02,937
<i>Deliberately keeping you at
a distance by my own hand.</i>

1368
01:39:04,813 --> 01:39:07,316
<i>All because I didn't want you
to get caught up in any of this.</i>

1369
01:39:08,492 --> 01:39:10,243
<i>But now, I believe...</i>

1370
01:39:11,111 --> 01:39:13,656
<i>That perhaps you could have changed</i>

1371
01:39:14,014 --> 01:39:18,169
<i>Father, Mother,
and the rest of the Uchiha.</i>

1372
01:39:21,246 --> 01:39:23,791
<i>If I had been open with you
from the start...</i>

1373
01:39:24,242 --> 01:39:27,711
<i>And looked you straight in the eyes
and told you the truth,</i>

1374
01:39:28,987 --> 01:39:31,482
<i>then I wouldn't have had
to stand before you,</i>

1375
01:39:31,507 --> 01:39:33,717
<i>from above, as a failure,
telling you all of this.</i>

1376
01:39:34,668 --> 01:39:39,840
<i>So this time...I want to impart
this truth to you...</i>

1377
01:39:41,558 --> 01:39:44,311
<i>You don't ever have to forgive me.</i>

1378
01:39:46,063 --> 01:39:49,149
<i>And no matter what you do
from here on out, know this...</i>

1379
01:39:50,442 --> 01:39:53,028
<i>I will love you always.</i>

1380
01:40:01,787 --> 01:40:03,288
I'm going to the battlefield!

1381
01:40:03,706 --> 01:40:07,584
I won't let the village,
and Itachi become nothing!

1382
01:40:13,632 --> 01:40:14,633
It's been decided then!

1383
01:40:15,009 --> 01:40:15,802
Tobirama!

1384
01:40:16,001 --> 01:40:17,336
Prepare to fly us outside!

1385
01:40:17,837 --> 01:40:20,764
Even if I wanted to use Flying Raijin,
I'm bound right now.

1386
01:40:21,407 --> 01:40:23,784
Orochimaru, was it?
What will you do?

1387
01:40:24,184 --> 01:40:27,855
You said earlier that
you'd follow Sasuke.

1388
01:40:28,972 --> 01:40:32,272
Of course...We will accompany him.

1389
01:40:32,492 --> 01:40:33,702
What?!

1390
01:40:33,927 --> 01:40:35,846
J-Jugo, what about you?

1391
01:40:35,946 --> 01:40:37,030
I'm going too.

1392
01:40:37,489 --> 01:40:39,709
It's my job to protect Sasuke.

1393
01:40:40,642 --> 01:40:42,435
<i>Four super-strong zombies...</i>

1394
01:40:42,786 --> 01:40:44,121
<i>Three monsters...</i>

1395
01:40:44,496 --> 01:40:47,583
<i>If I tag along, I'm dead for sure!</i>

1396
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:49,694
<i>I'm making a break for it
when I see a chance!</i>

1397
01:40:53,330 --> 01:40:55,582
This view brings back memories!

1398
01:40:57,634 --> 01:40:58,885
<i>It's now or never!</i>

1399
01:40:59,586 --> 01:41:00,671
What the hell?!

1400
01:41:00,804 --> 01:41:03,724
It's you after all, Sasuke!

1401
01:41:04,308 --> 01:41:06,810
I sensed your chakra
and I couldn't believe it,

1402
01:41:06,835 --> 01:41:08,777
so I backtracked and look what I find!

1403
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:11,081
Karin...

1404
01:41:11,206 --> 01:41:16,419
Oh my...So many of my best experiments
gathered here in one place!

1405
01:41:20,741 --> 01:41:21,825
You bastard...!

1406
01:41:21,909 --> 01:41:24,036
I'll never forgive you!

1407
01:41:24,244 --> 01:41:25,871
I'm sorry, Karin.

1408
01:41:27,515 --> 01:41:33,254
You bastard! As if a simple apology
will get you off the hook...

1409
01:41:33,727 --> 01:41:35,521
you good for nothing...

1410
01:41:36,215 --> 01:41:39,760
I see you still have
a weakness for Sasuke, Karin...

1411
01:41:40,636 --> 01:41:42,563
Listen, Lord Orochimaru!

1412
01:41:42,628 --> 01:41:46,549
Sasuke...had the gall...
to stab me and...

1413
01:41:46,666 --> 01:41:49,210
What a coincidence. Me too.

1414
01:41:49,711 --> 01:41:52,088
But I'm helping Sasuke now.

1415
01:41:52,631 --> 01:41:55,592
This is perfect timing. You help too.

1416
01:41:55,984 --> 01:41:57,151
What?!

1417
01:41:58,078 --> 01:41:59,621
I guess I have no choice...

1418
01:41:59,863 --> 01:42:00,656
Who is she?

1419
01:42:00,656 --> 01:42:02,616
Judging from the chakra
and that red hair...

1420
01:42:02,825 --> 01:42:04,593
She's from the Uzumaki Clan.

1421
01:42:04,968 --> 01:42:08,263
<i>One more idiot joins the pack.</i>

1422
01:42:08,394 --> 01:42:10,563
<i>I bet Madara will be surprised.</i>

1423
01:42:12,668 --> 01:42:13,877
Orochimaru...

1424
01:42:13,961 --> 01:42:16,839
Why did you decide to help Sasuke?

1425
01:42:17,172 --> 01:42:20,175
You were trying to destroy the village.

1426
01:42:20,825 --> 01:42:23,637
After being inside Kabuto,
I realized something...

1427
01:42:24,287 --> 01:42:28,367
He imitated the way I lived and
tried to possess everything,

1428
01:42:28,392 --> 01:42:30,060
and failed.

1429
01:42:30,769 --> 01:42:35,023
So now, I'm just curious about
the different path Sasuke has chosen.

1430
01:42:35,665 --> 01:42:39,532
Unlike Kabuto, Sasuke didn't copy me.

1431
01:42:40,921 --> 01:42:42,297
Fellow Hokage!

1432
01:42:42,322 --> 01:42:43,991
As we stand atop the Great Stone Faces

1433
01:42:44,016 --> 01:42:45,592
that have watched over
the Hidden Leaf...

1434
01:42:45,617 --> 01:42:48,662
Let us burn this sight of
the village into our memory!

1435
01:42:55,043 --> 01:42:56,753
I'm finally going to see my son.

1436
01:42:56,837 --> 01:43:01,008
Naruto, I wasn't able to do
anything for you as a father...

1437
01:43:01,391 --> 01:43:03,727
I'll make it up to you by
bringing you a huge present.

1438
01:43:04,052 --> 01:43:06,638
All right! It's been a while
since my last war!

1439
01:43:07,139 --> 01:43:09,349
I'd better be on my toes!

1440
01:43:09,766 --> 01:43:12,561
Madara...We'll defeat you
this time for sure!

1441
01:43:12,603 --> 01:43:14,146
This may sound foolish,

1442
01:43:14,403 --> 01:43:17,907
but I'm kind of looking forward
to seeing my old friend!

1443
01:43:18,692 --> 01:43:20,360
Just you wait, Madara!

1444
01:43:20,885 --> 01:43:22,804
There's always conflict,
no matter what the era.

1445
01:43:23,405 --> 01:43:26,241
But this shall be the end of wars!

1446
01:43:26,742 --> 01:43:28,076
Let's go!
