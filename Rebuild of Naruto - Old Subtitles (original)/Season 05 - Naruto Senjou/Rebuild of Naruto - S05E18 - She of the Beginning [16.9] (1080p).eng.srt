1
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,852
All that's left…is them.

2
00:00:25,989 --> 00:00:29,701
<i>So it really didn't
let the light through…</i>

3
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,323
Finally…

4
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:36,411
Looks like it didn't affect
that black one.

5
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:37,912
Sasuke!

6
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:40,707
What do we do to release everyone
from the genjutsu?!

7
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:45,253
Rinnegan genjutsu can be dealt with
using Rinnegan, probably.

8
00:00:46,114 --> 00:00:48,645
Which means we need
Sasuke's left eye.

9
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,509
<i>I won't let that happen.</i>

10
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:55,138
<i>All that's left to do is to
get rid of you guys…</i>

11
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:59,893
Which I, the savior
of the world will do.

12
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:03,897
That eye on his forehead!

13
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,359
Be careful.

14
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,446
We're surrounded in all directions
by four of his Shadows.

15
00:01:11,883 --> 00:01:13,134
I know that!

16
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,992
I won't allow you to
do anything further.

17
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:19,370
I just severed the Karmic Cycle
of this world.

18
00:01:19,994 --> 00:01:24,375
I have freed humankind from
their suffering, pain and their futility.

19
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,463
But all this…is just a lie!

20
00:01:28,746 --> 00:01:33,664
Naruto, you're the one who's
interfering with everyone's happiness.

21
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:38,451
Just look at this world now. All
fighting between shinobi has ceased.

22
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:41,601
I've transformed hell into heaven.

23
00:01:41,626 --> 00:01:44,546
I've finally corrected
Hashirama's mistake.

24
00:01:44,948 --> 00:01:47,926
What do you mean by
the First Hokage's "mistake"?

25
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:51,653
You Hidden Leaf may not
want to acknowledge it,

26
00:01:51,705 --> 00:01:57,127
but Hashirama ultimately failed
in reforming the shinobi world.

27
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:01,420
In the beginning, both Hashirama
and I had the same goals.

28
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,105
And we worked together.

29
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:09,178
We tried to change
the shinobi world

30
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:12,713
that sent out barely grown
children out to war.

31
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,348
The two of us created
the shinobi village.

32
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:24,250
However, that does not result
in true peace.

33
00:02:24,572 --> 00:02:28,200
People cannot show
each other their true feelings.

34
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,925
Fear, suspicion, and resentment…

35
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,510
…never subside.

36
00:02:34,575 --> 00:02:36,828
My opinions were pushed aside

37
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,200
and the shinobi world moved forward
in accordance with Hashirama's vision.

38
00:02:42,471 --> 00:02:44,473
And what happened because of it?

39
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:47,417
The fighting between shinobi
hasn't stopped.

40
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:48,768
Rather than ceasing,

41
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,453
establishing ninja villages led to

42
00:02:50,478 --> 00:02:52,037
an increase in
their military build-up,

43
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:55,383
which resulted in battles
that turned into great wars…

44
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:58,578
with countless lives lost.

45
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:00,828
The battling in what became
the First Great Ninja War…

46
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,310
The Second Great Ninja War…

47
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,168
The Third Great Ninja War…

48
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,702
The fighting never stopped.

49
00:03:12,727 --> 00:03:16,147
That is Hashirama's legacy
to the shinobi world.

50
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:23,494
Although I admit that I triggered
this Fourth Great Ninja War…

51
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,586
That's right! Because of you,
so many people died!

52
00:03:27,127 --> 00:03:30,714
I did make a proposition to
peacefully hand over the Tailed Beasts.

53
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:34,088
Right now, everyone is
inside the Divine Tree.

54
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,799
Each one of them,
dreaming their own idyllic dreams.

55
00:03:37,214 --> 00:03:40,509
They are in their own ideal worlds.

56
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,056
Is this your idea of
a perfect world?

57
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:46,498
You're just deceiving people.

58
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,062
I just want to be the savior

59
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:53,689
that ends the long history of
fighting amongst shinobi.

60
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,071
Just know this…

61
00:03:58,257 --> 00:04:00,342
It's all over.

62
00:04:06,809 --> 00:04:09,214
<i>You're wrong, Madara.</i>

63
00:04:09,534 --> 00:04:12,078
<i>You are not the savior…</i>

64
00:04:12,274 --> 00:04:14,902
<i>Nor is this the end of things…</i>

65
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,842
<i>I can't…move…</i>

66
00:04:22,097 --> 00:04:23,098
What's going on?

67
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:27,275
<i>How can you say that you,
unlike Obito,</i>

68
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,678
<i>are able to completely
take advantage of others?</i>

69
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:36,693
<i>Isn't that presumptuous to think
that you alone are different?</i>

70
00:04:36,718 --> 00:04:38,303
<i>My dear Madara…</i>

71
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,831
<i>You have also been inside
a phantom dream…</i>

72
00:04:43,524 --> 00:04:47,319
<i>Inside a dream that I concocted.</i>

73
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,539
Black Zetsu…

74
00:04:49,712 --> 00:04:51,672
What are you saying?

75
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,128
I created you.

76
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:59,716
You are my will incarnate!

77
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:01,929
<i>Wrong again…</i>

78
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:04,137
<i>My will is…</i>

79
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,431
<i>Kaguya's!</i>

80
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,683
What the hell is going on?

81
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,890
They're having a falling out,
at this stage in the game?

82
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,895
No, that's not it.

83
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,856
He just mentioned Kaguya.

84
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,357
Huh? Kaguya?

85
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,650
What is that?

86
00:05:17,846 --> 00:05:19,890
The one the Sage of
the Six Paths mentioned.

87
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,292
What's up with this guy?

88
00:05:34,317 --> 00:05:35,944
This chakra is ridiculous!

89
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:38,597
All of Madara's shadows that were
surrounding us have disappeared!

90
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,131
Something's about to happen!

91
00:05:57,406 --> 00:06:01,160
Is he absorbing all the chakra
that's erupting from the ground?

92
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,532
Where is all this thick potent
chakra coming from?

93
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:10,036
It's probably from everyone trapped
in the Infinite Tsukuyomi!

94
00:06:13,695 --> 00:06:15,738
This is really bad, Sasuke!

95
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,212
This chakra is much stronger
than Ten-Tails'!

96
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,713
Stop them before they move!

97
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,219
Go, Naruto!

98
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,439
You mean while they're
still swelling up, right?

99
00:06:40,787 --> 00:06:44,249
<i>Like two moths flying
into the flame…</i>

100
00:06:44,395 --> 00:06:48,769
<i>I'm going to absorb all the chakra
out of the two of you right now.</i>

101
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:50,155
Damn it!

102
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,418
Don't, Sakura!

103
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,951
But!

104
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,833
Action without a plan
is meaningless.

105
00:06:57,444 --> 00:06:58,654
Damn it!

106
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,464
<i>I can't move!</i>

107
00:07:00,489 --> 00:07:03,242
Sasuke! If we don't stop him now…

108
00:07:03,655 --> 00:07:07,742
He'll drain everyone else's chakra
before ours and they'll all die!

109
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:14,123
<i>Don't worry,
no one is going to die.</i>

110
00:07:14,148 --> 00:07:15,654
<i>Even when Kaguya previously cast</i>

111
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:19,349
<i>the Infinite Tsukuyomi
upon the populace,</i>

112
00:07:19,374 --> 00:07:23,086
<i>she kept them alive and preserved…</i>

113
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:27,738
<i>…in order to form them
into her soldiers.</i>

114
00:07:28,057 --> 00:07:30,184
"Form"? What do you mean?!

115
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:34,257
<i>You seem to be denser than Itachi.</i>

116
00:07:34,282 --> 00:07:37,952
<i>How can one use
ordinary people in combat?</i>

117
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,171
You're not saying that—!

118
00:07:41,384 --> 00:07:44,325
<i>She converted them
into White Zetsu.</i>

119
00:07:44,691 --> 00:07:50,363
<i>What's left of those who were under
the previous Infinite Tsukuyomi…</i>

120
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:52,557
<i>That's what White Zetsu are.</i>

121
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:57,519
<i>They've been transformed
ever so slowly over time.</i>

122
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:01,063
Are you saying everyone's gonna
turn into those white things?!

123
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,201
Hey!
Look at how big he swelled up!

124
00:08:08,226 --> 00:08:11,866
He's bloated because his body can't
tolerate the amount of chakra he absorbed!

125
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,618
At this rate,
he's going to explode!

126
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,453
Why?

127
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,538
Why did this happen—?

128
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:22,997
<i>Hashirama…
Where…did I go wrong?</i>

129
00:08:27,364 --> 00:08:28,365
He's shrinking?!

130
00:08:33,071 --> 00:08:33,864
Obito!

131
00:08:48,189 --> 00:08:51,692
Isn't she the one
Super Gramps talked about?

132
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,908
Otsutsuki…

133
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,141
Kaguya!

134
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,072
Sasuke! Naruto!

135
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,833
<i>The way they are currently,
those two can manage…</i>

136
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,752
<i>But Sakura…</i>

137
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,673
<i>Don't make any careless
moves right now!</i>

138
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,803
These two…

139
00:11:19,316 --> 00:11:21,276
are Hagoromo and Hamura's…

140
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,100
No, rather they're…

141
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,227
Indra and Ashura's…

142
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:46,664
So it was Hagoromo
who gave them the jutsu…

143
00:11:49,185 --> 00:11:51,021
<i>Sasuke! Naruto!</i>

144
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,586
<i>Thank goodness!</i>

145
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,090
<i>Who is she?</i>

146
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,702
<i>And why did Madara
suddenly become her?</i>

147
00:12:00,724 --> 00:12:03,935
<i>This chakra is far greater
than Madara's…</i>

148
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,392
<i>I can't believe such
a person ever existed.</i>

149
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,087
<i>Hagoromo knew she would appear,</i>

150
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,511
<i>that's why he entrusted us with—</i>

151
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,071
<i>Obito…</i>

152
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,413
What are your intentions?

153
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,850
It's futile to speak to you about that,

154
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,960
when all you do is just tamper
with chakra,

155
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,904
without knowing its true meaning.

156
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,174
This place, this land…

157
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:40,747
is my precious nursery.

158
00:12:41,574 --> 00:12:44,543
I cannot let it be damaged further.

159
00:12:45,522 --> 00:12:47,816
Let us stop fighting…

160
00:12:50,216 --> 00:12:51,445
Here that is…

161
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,775
I shall erase…

162
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,444
You all here…

163
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:03,741
No way!

164
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,367
<i>Is that lava below?</i>

165
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,244
<i>Is this a genjutsu?</i>

166
00:13:07,861 --> 00:13:08,612
<i>No…</i>

167
00:13:08,782 --> 00:13:10,534
<i>This feels…</i>

168
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:11,811
<i>different!</i>

169
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,542
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

170
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,213
Sasuke! Over there!

171
00:13:27,615 --> 00:13:29,533
What're you doing?
Help them, not me!

172
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,148
How did you…?

173
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:47,618
Kakashi tied one end of a scroll onto
a kunai and used it like a rope.

174
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,163
For Obito, he just pinned him
to the wall with a kunai, however…

175
00:13:53,783 --> 00:13:55,955
way to go, Kakashi Sensei!

176
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,378
<i>Obito…</i>

177
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,547
<i>Sorry for being rough with you…</i>

178
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:01,908
Oh!

179
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:10,266
It wasn't a genjutsu, after all…

180
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:12,227
<i>Don't tell me…</i>

181
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,604
<i>She summoned a different dimension?</i>

182
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,447
Eyes forward, Naruto.

183
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,119
Naruto…

184
00:14:30,443 --> 00:14:32,653
I'm going to be frank with you…

185
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:38,168
This world will come to an end
if either one of us dies.

186
00:14:39,155 --> 00:14:41,323
Only your Six Paths Power
of the Light Style

187
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,049
and my Six Paths Power
of the Shadow Style,

188
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,218
can seal away that being
in front of us.

189
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,639
If we don't succeed,

190
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,933
mankind will perish.

191
00:14:53,381 --> 00:14:56,134
We can't afford to die,
no matter what…

192
00:14:57,144 --> 00:14:59,021
When the Infinite Tsukuyomi
was launched…

193
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,942
Kakashi and Sakura just happened
to be near you…

194
00:15:02,315 --> 00:15:03,343
That's just how it is.

195
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,156
You understand
what that means, right?

196
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:11,744
I know.

197
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:17,249
I get what you're saying
and I know that you're right.

198
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:22,338
But…this is also a situation when
your body just moves on its own…

199
00:15:23,684 --> 00:15:24,977
Like that time on the bridge.

200
00:15:30,726 --> 00:15:31,852
Well, never mind.

201
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:36,769
I know that you get
what I mean, Sasuke.

202
00:15:43,452 --> 00:15:45,037
<i>Sasuke's right.</i>

203
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,197
<i>Back then…</i>

204
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,908
<i>Maybe Sasuke acted subconsciously…</i>

205
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,206
<i>Even so…</i>

206
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,251
<i>Thank you…Naruto.</i>

207
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,125
Damn it!

208
00:16:12,136 --> 00:16:12,845
Damn it!

209
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,439
Now's our chance!

210
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:27,945
<i>Byakugan!</i>

211
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,406
<i>Damn it! My hawk's chakra points
have been hit!</i>

212
00:16:32,238 --> 00:16:33,767
<i>This calls for Susano'o!</i>

213
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,883
<i>Madara's rods are…</i>

214
00:16:52,869 --> 00:16:54,071
I can finally move…

215
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:55,932
Now if…

216
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,643
<i>If I head to the spot where
I sensed that massive chakra…</i>

217
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,854
<i>I might learn something.</i>

218
00:17:07,264 --> 00:17:10,517
<i>But…the chakra
suddenly dissipated.</i>

219
00:17:17,894 --> 00:17:20,897
They've disappeared…
Did they defeat Madara?

220
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,002
<i>I've got to get to Naruto…</i>

221
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,545
<i>just one more time…</i>

222
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:31,842
Naruto, you—?!

223
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:34,845
Huh?

224
00:17:36,023 --> 00:17:37,066
You can levitate?

225
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,059
<i>That's right…</i>

226
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,520
<i>Madara, when he was enhanced
by Six Paths' chakra, also levitated…</i>

227
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,650
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

228
00:17:59,482 --> 00:18:01,562
Take care of Sakura and Kakashi Sensei.

229
00:18:06,389 --> 00:18:08,600
Six Paths' chakra…

230
00:18:09,223 --> 00:18:12,351
You act triumphantly just because
you have a special accoutrement.

231
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,134
However…

232
00:18:14,434 --> 00:18:16,644
No matter what kind of chakra…

233
00:18:17,395 --> 00:18:21,024
All chakra belongs to me
and me alone.

234
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,030
Once more…

235
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,779
…I shall reunify all chakra!

236
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,842
<i>Sasuke! Now!</i>

237
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:50,731
Sasuke!

238
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,548
<i>Damn it! I can't stop!</i>

239
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,039
Sasuke!

240
00:20:08,111 --> 00:20:09,737
Even Susano'o doesn't work.

241
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,464
Let's get Obito while
we still have the chance.

242
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:22,763
I forgot that you could use
Teleportation-like jutsu now.

243
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,974
You had me worried there!

244
00:20:27,588 --> 00:20:29,298
It's like this foothold.

245
00:20:29,689 --> 00:20:32,525
We've both benefitted
from Six Paths' power.

246
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:37,277
But having received it is meaningless
unless we seal her away.

247
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:38,862
Yeah!

248
00:21:20,703 --> 00:21:23,789
<i>My children, with whom
I shared my chakra…</i>

249
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,376
<i>I can't move…</i>

250
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:38,920
<i>Now…come to your mother…</i>

251
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:46,263
She's taking…our chakra, Sasuke!

252
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:51,727
<i>Kaguya seems to see
her two children…</i>

253
00:21:51,752 --> 00:21:54,838
<i>when she looks at the two of you.</i>

254
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:57,107
<i>Isn't that sweet?</i>

255
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:01,987
<i>She, who was sealed away
by her own children.</i>

256
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,823
<i>Such a poor, pitiable mother…</i>

257
00:22:05,495 --> 00:22:08,790
Why'd Six Paths Super Gramps
seal away his own mom?

258
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:12,364
I thought he sealed away Ten-Tails…

259
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:16,918
<i>It appears you have the wrong idea…</i>

260
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,714
Just who and what are you,
Black Zetsu?

261
00:22:21,854 --> 00:22:24,065
<i>I am Kaguya's child.</i>

262
00:22:24,222 --> 00:22:25,223
What?!

263
00:22:25,755 --> 00:22:27,841
<i>His aura seems different,
all of a sudden…</i>

264
00:22:29,545 --> 00:22:33,048
<i>I recorded everything that happened
while Mother was gone.</i>

265
00:22:33,316 --> 00:22:35,818
<i>And molded it as well.</i>

266
00:22:36,748 --> 00:22:38,750
<i>The tale of shinobi…</i>

267
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:42,706
<i>is the tale of restoring Mother.</i>

268
00:22:42,731 --> 00:22:44,817
Huh?! What're you talking about?!

269
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:47,115
What do you mean?

270
00:22:47,678 --> 00:22:52,975
<i>Since you know Mother's name,
you must have met Hagoromo.</i>

271
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:58,418
<i>I knew that it was possible, depending on
the power of the reincarnates.</i>

272
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,673
<i>As well as receiving the power
to seal away Mother…</i>

273
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,177
But we're gonna seal away
the Ten-Tails!

274
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:12,891
<i>It's rare to see the reincarnates of
Indra and Ashura cooperating this closely.</i>

275
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,811
<i>You two know nothing.</i>

276
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:20,357
<i>Let me tell you her tale while
I suck out all of your chakra.</i>

277
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:23,360
<i>Like I told you earlier…</i>

278
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:28,365
<i>Mother was sealed away previously
by her own children.</i>

279
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:34,121
Apparently, it was an extremely
powerful seal…

280
00:23:34,501 --> 00:23:39,937
<i>The jutsu transformed Ten-Tails into a
Catastrophic Planetary Devastation core…</i>

281
00:23:40,245 --> 00:23:43,582
<i>…and turned it into the moon.</i>

282
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:48,844
<i>But just before the seal took hold,
she gave birth to me.</i>

283
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,930
<i>In order that she could
one day be restored.</i>

284
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,851
<i>I shall now show you two
all of that…</i>

285
00:23:56,371 --> 00:24:00,792
<i>I don't have any candy,
but the puppet show is about to begin.</i>

286
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:29,348
<i>The intense fighting between my mother
and the brothers continued for months.</i>

287
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:34,130
<i>It took a massive toll
on the land.</i>

288
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:38,768
<i>And at long last,
the decisive moment came to be.</i>

289
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:52,282
<i>Hagoromo and Hamura's powers
overcame Mother's.</i>

290
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,368
Now, Elder Brother!

291
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,248
<i>Catastrophic Planetary Devastation!</i>

292
00:25:33,543 --> 00:25:36,551
<i>Mother gathered up every ounce
of energy she had left,</i>

293
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:40,163
<i>and just before the seal took hold,
she gave birth to me.</i>

294
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,707
You…came out of her?

295
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:46,294
<i>Even Hagoromo did not
know of this truth…</i>

296
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:48,542
<i>Nor was he aware that</i>

297
00:25:48,567 --> 00:25:50,600
<i>I was working on
her behalf to restore her.</i>

298
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:41,182
I split the Ten-Tails
into nine souls.

299
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:52,652
When you look at them like this,
they're very cute.

300
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,696
What will you do with them?

301
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,967
I will take care of
these Tailed Beasts.

302
00:26:58,677 --> 00:27:01,347
I will raise them to trust humans
and to help them.

303
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,757
Elder Brother, I think I'm going
to stay by Mother.

304
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,300
Hamura?

305
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,260
I felt her emotions.

306
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,888
Mother was afraid all
of the time.

307
00:27:20,697 --> 00:27:22,907
In order to protect us,

308
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:25,435
Mother only did what
she thought she had to do…

309
00:27:26,276 --> 00:27:28,724
It made me feel that she was just
a woman, alone all by herself.

310
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:33,234
I guess I love Mother, after all.

311
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:35,404
Hamura…

312
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:38,198
You are a kind soul.

313
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,283
Elder Brother…

314
00:27:40,383 --> 00:27:42,552
I will always be up there
in the sky…

315
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:44,579
watching over the world
you create.

316
00:27:47,741 --> 00:27:49,284
Come visit once in a while.

317
00:27:49,618 --> 00:27:51,328
We won't be that far apart.

318
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,216
I will. Take care of yourself.

319
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:08,812
<i>And so, that's how the battle between
my mother and the brothers ended.</i>

320
00:28:09,656 --> 00:28:13,274
<i>But I was left, with no power at all.</i>

321
00:28:13,739 --> 00:28:16,492
<i>That is why I went deep
into the darkness,</i>

322
00:28:16,517 --> 00:28:21,104
<i>and carefully planned
my mother's revival.</i>

323
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:24,511
<i>In the meantime, Hagoromo
was ignorant of all of this</i>

324
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,287
<i>and raised Indra and Ashura.</i>

325
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:30,625
<i>He even created that Ninshu,
Ninja Creed nonsense.</i>

326
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,670
<i>Time passed and Hagoromo died…</i>

327
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,883
<i>And just before passing away,</i>

328
00:28:35,908 --> 00:28:38,633
<i>he scattered the Tailed Beasts
to various parts of this world.</i>

329
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,137
<i>Two things are required
to revive Mother…</i>

330
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:45,890
<i>The Divine Tree and Infinite Tsukuyomi
by means of Rinnegan.</i>

331
00:28:46,241 --> 00:28:49,853
<i>But the Rinnegan requires
Hagoromo's chakra,</i>

332
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,813
<i>which he passed on
to Indra and Ashura.</i>

333
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:54,441
<i>And the Tailed Beasts,
which form the Ten-Tails,</i>

334
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:57,152
<i>were scattered across the world.</i>

335
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:02,824
<i>In order to bring Mother back,
all of these things had to be collected.</i>

336
00:29:03,482 --> 00:29:06,985
<i>You can't imagine the amount time
that was required to do this.</i>

337
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:11,666
<i>So first of all,
in order to regain Hagoromo's chakra,</i>

338
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:16,212
<i>I took advantage of Indra who
lost the fight over succession.</i>

339
00:29:16,436 --> 00:29:18,397
<i>I tempted Indra.</i>

340
00:29:18,422 --> 00:29:21,227
<i>And later,
I selected Indra's descendants,</i>

341
00:29:21,252 --> 00:29:25,548
<i>the Uchiha to be
the cast of my tale.</i>

342
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:31,811
<i>I revised the stupid script that
Hagoromo wrote just a little bit.</i>

343
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,271
You mean…?!

344
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:37,275
<i>That's right.
Hagoromo's Stone Tablet…</i>

345
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:41,112
<i>I rewrote it to say
the Infinite Tsukuyomi</i>

346
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,823
<i>was the path to save the Uchiha.</i>

347
00:29:44,174 --> 00:29:45,592
<i>I must say…</i>

348
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:50,955
<i>You Uchiha performed
your parts brilliantly.</i>

349
00:29:51,142 --> 00:29:52,396
Why you—!

350
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:55,210
<i>Indra and the Uchiha.</i>

351
00:29:56,552 --> 00:29:58,763
<i>Ashura and the Senju.</i>

352
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:03,968
<i>I was able to set up a pattern
of fighting and power seeking.</i>

353
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,846
<i>Furthermore, time after time,</i>

354
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:13,186
<i>I'd approach the reincarnate of
Indra and Ashura in each clan…</i>

355
00:30:13,403 --> 00:30:16,281
<i>to attempt Rinnegan manifestation.</i>

356
00:30:16,449 --> 00:30:18,492
<i>But it always ended in failure.</i>

357
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:23,321
<i>Just with that alone,
a thousand years passed.</i>

358
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:29,077
<i>But when Madara Uchiha and
Hashirama Senju were reincarnated,</i>

359
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:31,146
<i>I came to believe…</i>

360
00:30:31,725 --> 00:30:34,311
<i>that Madara could achieve it.</i>

361
00:30:35,205 --> 00:30:39,168
<i>That this was the first step
towards Mother's revival.</i>

362
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:40,839
<i>However…</i>

363
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:10,869
<i>Madara Uchiha lost
to Hashirama Senju…</i>

364
00:31:11,925 --> 00:31:15,234
<i>I thought I had to go back
to the drawing board.</i>

365
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:20,169
<i>But Fate did not turn
her back on me…</i>

366
00:31:20,848 --> 00:31:26,312
<i>Madara's corpse is like
a treasure trove to a shinobi.</i>

367
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:29,782
<i>Tobirama, who had been studying
the mysteries of the Sharingan,</i>

368
00:31:29,807 --> 00:31:31,976
<i>stopped short of disposing his corpse.</i>

369
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:35,655
<i>And instead, hid Madara deep
within the mountains of the Leaf Village.</i>

370
00:31:36,581 --> 00:31:38,949
<i>But Madara was no fool…</i>

371
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,733
<i>He figured that if he lost
to Senju in battle,</i>

372
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:45,820
<i>Tobirama would not
get rid of his body.</i>

373
00:31:45,845 --> 00:31:48,222
<i>So he placed a jutsu on himself.</i>

374
00:31:48,881 --> 00:31:54,662
<i>You can invoke a time-delay spell in
one's eye using the Mangekyo Sharingan.</i>

375
00:31:55,169 --> 00:32:00,706
<i>Just like the way Itachi implanted the
Amaterasu with a time delay in you, Sasuke.</i>

376
00:32:02,528 --> 00:32:06,365
<i>Madara had installed
the Izanagi in his right eye.</i>

377
00:32:07,732 --> 00:32:11,988
<i>At the cost of his right eye, Madara
rewrote reality and returned to life.</i>

378
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,974
<i>He then passed off
a shadow clone as his corpse.</i>

379
00:32:17,783 --> 00:32:24,210
<i>He vomited the flesh he bit off of
Hashirama, and grafted it on his wound.</i>

380
00:32:24,543 --> 00:32:28,630
<i>After that, Madara awakened
his Rinnegan…</i>

381
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:31,157
<i>and summoned the Gedo Statue.</i>

382
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:35,036
<i>He then cultured Hashirama's flesh
using the Gedo Statue,</i>

383
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,288
<i>in an attempt to prolong
his life further.</i>

384
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:40,124
<i>Those goblins, the White Zetsu,</i>

385
00:32:40,149 --> 00:32:42,610
<i>seemed to be an incidental
by-product of that.</i>

386
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:47,336
<i>But they were actually the people
put under the last Infinite Tsukuyomi,</i>

387
00:32:47,361 --> 00:32:50,802
<i>whom I extracted from the statue.
I just made it look that way.</i>

388
00:32:51,668 --> 00:32:57,067
<i>"Two polar opposites operating together
gives rise to all things in this universe."</i>

389
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,852
<i>Just as it was inscribed
in the Stone Tablet,</i>

390
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:03,064
<i>Madara solidified his attachment
to Hashirama.</i>

391
00:33:04,124 --> 00:33:05,917
<i>I began formulating a plan…</i>

392
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:09,318
<i>to collect the Tailed Beasts
by making it look like</i>

393
00:33:09,343 --> 00:33:14,242
<i>I was born out of Madara,
and to also manipulate Obito.</i>

394
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:19,255
<i>I formed the Akatsuki and
steered them towards war.</i>

395
00:33:20,276 --> 00:33:22,245
<i>In order to increase
battle strength,</i>

396
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:25,628
<i>I deliberately let Kabuto
discover Madara's corpse…</i>

397
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,005
<i>And in addition,</i>

398
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:30,408
<i>I guided him to use Madara's corpse
as a bargaining chip,</i>

399
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,719
<i>and made Obito cooperate.</i>

400
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,054
<i>This war went exactly as I planned.</i>

401
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:38,474
<i>The Infinite Tsukuyomi was
launched during this war…</i>

402
00:33:38,605 --> 00:33:42,937
<i>And by amassing a large amount of the
human chakra that had been scattered…</i>

403
00:33:42,962 --> 00:33:45,172
<i>Mother was restored.</i>

404
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:50,653
I…

405
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:54,115
Detest you.

406
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:56,993
Hagoromo…

407
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:58,828
Hamura…

408
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:02,457
You…

409
00:34:04,784 --> 00:34:06,240
are mine.

410
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,672
My role has come to an end.

411
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:14,719
You shall return with me to
the almighty god that is Mother.

412
00:34:18,013 --> 00:34:19,264
You two aren't…

413
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:25,605
You two alone aren't the entirety
of shinobi history!

414
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:29,108
Besides…

415
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,903
moms are supposed to be happy
about their kids leaving the nest!

416
00:34:32,217 --> 00:34:34,469
That's what being a mom means!

417
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,096
<i>Your teenage rebellion continues.</i>

418
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:41,788
<i>Mother is the very progenitor of chakra.</i>

419
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:45,625
<i>You brats can't hope to
accomplish anything.</i>

420
00:34:47,955 --> 00:34:51,750
Naruto, we need to make an opening,
so we can launch the Sealing Jutsu.

421
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,007
Yeah!

422
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,550
And the only thing that will work…

423
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,177
is that jutsu!

424
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,515
"That" jutsu?

425
00:35:00,987 --> 00:35:01,988
Yeah…

426
00:35:02,461 --> 00:35:04,588
Sasuke, hear me out.

427
00:35:05,076 --> 00:35:11,249
<i>I don't know what you're scheming,
but Mother absorbs all jutsu.</i>

428
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:14,195
<i>Your actions are meaningless.</i>

429
00:35:18,069 --> 00:35:19,070
How is it going?

430
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,246
Looks like they're just staring
each other down.

431
00:35:24,272 --> 00:35:25,273
I see…

432
00:35:27,295 --> 00:35:31,366
The power to forcefully drag us all
into this dimension, that isn't genjutsu…

433
00:35:32,969 --> 00:35:34,595
This is on a totally different scale.

434
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,469
She's like…

435
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,761
…a god.

436
00:35:41,844 --> 00:35:44,930
How do you plan on fighting
someone like that, Naruto?

437
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:48,187
This could be the end…

438
00:35:49,344 --> 00:35:51,304
But we gotta give it our best shot.

439
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:55,528
Just like we've been
doing all along, right?

440
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,033
Are you serious?

441
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,327
We won't know unless we try.

442
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,875
I've been secretly
practicing this jutsu

443
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,106
even more than the Rasengan,
ya know?!

444
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:15,047
It's worth giving it a shot, right?

445
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:22,930
If there's a chance
it'll create an opening…

446
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:27,977
Fine. I'll get my left eye ready.

447
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,104
Let's do it!

448
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:30,852
Yeah!

449
00:36:34,042 --> 00:36:35,043
<i>Amaterasu!</i>

450
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:40,199
They're making a move!

451
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,666
Take this!

452
00:37:01,081 --> 00:37:02,165
<i>Sexy Jutsu:</i>

453
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,513
- <i>Reverse Harem Jutsu!</i>
- <i>Reverse Harem Jutsu!</i>

454
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:15,191
<i>Sexy-type jutsu tend to work better
on stronger opponents, ya know!</i>

455
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:19,570
<i>That idiot! Using a jutsu like that
in this situation?!</i>

456
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:22,532
<i>That might work on me,
but there's no way that jutsu</i>

457
00:37:22,557 --> 00:37:24,725
<i>will work on someone so god-like!</i>

458
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,621
<i>It worked?!</i>

459
00:37:29,526 --> 00:37:32,070
<i>You may be the progenitor
of chakra or whatever…</i>

460
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,585
<i>But I'll bet you've never seen
a jutsu like this!</i>

461
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:39,036
This is the history of shinobi, ya fool!

462
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,550
<i>The number one most unpredictable…</i>

463
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,822
<i>Don't tell me that
Naruto's Pervy ninjutsu</i>

464
00:37:44,847 --> 00:37:46,640
<i>is going to save the world!</i>

465
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:50,111
<i>Master Jiraiya, are you watching?!</i>

466
00:37:53,808 --> 00:37:55,017
Now, Naruto!

467
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:57,066
Right!

468
00:38:17,382 --> 00:38:19,425
<i>It's cold! What's going on?!</i>

469
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,046
<i>Ice?</i>

470
00:38:29,635 --> 00:38:30,845
It changed!

471
00:38:33,302 --> 00:38:36,013
This place…
Did we shift dimensions again?

472
00:38:36,152 --> 00:38:38,195
There's no mistake that
this is our enemy's ability.

473
00:38:40,142 --> 00:38:43,562
To be able to rewrite the world
in an instant and make it reality…

474
00:38:44,247 --> 00:38:46,791
This really is just like genjutsu.

475
00:38:47,977 --> 00:38:49,520
An ice world this time?!

476
00:38:50,253 --> 00:38:51,254
On what principle?

477
00:39:07,683 --> 00:39:08,851
<i>She vanished!</i>

478
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,765
<i>This ability…</i>

479
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:12,417
<i>Can she move across dimensions?</i>

480
00:39:35,714 --> 00:39:36,756
<i>Why that—!</i>

481
00:39:39,788 --> 00:39:40,831
<i>Amaterasu!</i>

482
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:44,965
<i>Flame Control!</i>

483
00:39:52,133 --> 00:39:54,135
Thanks, Sasuke!

484
00:39:54,613 --> 00:39:57,491
Sorry the Sexy Jutsu didn't work.

485
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:01,899
I never really expected that
kind of jutsu would work.

486
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:03,818
This time, we're going
with my strategy…

487
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,194
Help me out.

488
00:40:06,744 --> 00:40:09,997
<i>Mother...These two
are quite annoying.</i>

489
00:40:10,771 --> 00:40:13,608
<i>Why don't you split them
up already…</i>

490
00:40:14,272 --> 00:40:16,650
<i>and take them on separately?</i>

491
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:30,271
Where am I?

492
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:31,843
Sasuke!

493
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:42,857
Damn it!

494
00:40:44,605 --> 00:40:47,733
<i>Now you won't be able to
seal Mother away.</i>

495
00:40:48,466 --> 00:40:52,247
<i>First, I'll suck out all
of your chakra!</i>

496
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,919
<i>You have nice reflexes.</i>

497
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:08,966
First, I have to find Sasuke!

498
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:12,303
<i>This child is fast.</i>

499
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:15,501
So I guess I won't be able to tell
where she's gonna strike from…

500
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,040
What is that?

501
00:42:15,976 --> 00:42:17,436
Is it possible that…

502
00:42:17,757 --> 00:42:20,718
we're the only ones
who were brought to this world?

503
00:42:21,841 --> 00:42:25,177
No. The real me is here too.

504
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:28,546
But I can't sense Sasuke.

505
00:42:34,941 --> 00:42:35,727
Where am I?

506
00:42:35,758 --> 00:42:36,759
Obito!

507
00:42:37,783 --> 00:42:38,784
Is that you, Kakashi?

508
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:44,725
I thought I died…

509
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,620
I healed you.

510
00:42:48,117 --> 00:42:49,118
Naruto!

511
00:42:50,306 --> 00:42:51,235
But…

512
00:42:53,883 --> 00:42:54,884
Yeah…

513
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:55,981
I know.

514
00:42:57,609 --> 00:42:59,110
What happened to Madara?

515
00:42:59,362 --> 00:43:00,405
Did you take him down?

516
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,955
No, things ended up
a little differently.

517
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:07,001
I'll explain it simply.

518
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,212
Might as well tell you guys
about The Sage of the Six Paths

519
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:13,132
and Kaguya too, and that seal!

520
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:15,259
I don't know what happened,

521
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:17,595
but I assume you didn't defeat
the enemy yet?

522
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:21,240
Take me to where the fight is.

523
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:23,231
You can tell me on the way.

524
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:47,249
Nothing seems to work…

525
00:43:51,458 --> 00:43:52,668
It's hard to believe.

526
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:56,425
So both your powers and
Sasuke's are necessary

527
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:59,620
in order to seal away this Kaguya?

528
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:01,138
Yeah!

529
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:04,475
But like I said earlier,
I can't sense Sasuke at all!

530
00:44:05,348 --> 00:44:07,517
The ice…is moving.

531
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:16,820
Over there!

532
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,180
<i>She's merged with Nature!</i>

533
00:44:51,872 --> 00:44:52,795
Naruto!

534
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:58,946
<i>She's finally showing herself.</i>

535
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,200
What's happening?

536
00:45:09,048 --> 00:45:10,758
<i>That's a form of Time-Space.</i>

537
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:17,172
<i>Okay...I've made it look
like I'm restrained…</i>

538
00:45:17,683 --> 00:45:20,769
<i>I'll just wait until she gets closer!</i>

539
00:45:21,868 --> 00:45:24,745
You said you suddenly
stopped sensing Sasuke?

540
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,014
Yeah.

541
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:29,184
I suspect he was taken
to another dimension.

542
00:45:30,563 --> 00:45:33,149
She emerged from
a different Time-Space.

543
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:36,191
It's similar to
my own visual prowess.

544
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,235
Can you enter it?

545
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:42,656
If I resonate my Kamui

546
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:46,510
the next time she connects and opens
a portal to another Time-Space,

547
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:48,704
I'm positive I can enter it.

548
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:53,459
If Sasuke is there, I can bring him back
to this dimension.

549
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:54,460
All right!

550
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:57,045
Then I'll go and support
the real me.

551
00:45:58,174 --> 00:45:59,175
However…

552
00:46:00,842 --> 00:46:03,261
I'll need an enormous amount
of chakra to do it…

553
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,846
since it's not
my own Time-Space.

554
00:46:06,617 --> 00:46:08,911
If my chakra runs out
while I'm there, I'm done.

555
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,351
Then I'll go with you.

556
00:46:11,828 --> 00:46:13,871
The real me won't go down
that quickly.

557
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:15,777
Because I'm strong.

558
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:18,358
Your clone chakra isn't enough.

559
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,866
Would it still be inadequate with
my 100 Healings chakra?

560
00:46:27,586 --> 00:46:29,129
That would give me
the bare minimum.

561
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:30,757
Both of you, come with me.

562
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:32,372
All right!

563
00:46:32,625 --> 00:46:35,403
We don't even know if
Sasuke is in that Time-Space.

564
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:38,462
But we'll start by getting
into close range with her.

565
00:46:39,278 --> 00:46:43,199
I promise to find Sasuke,
and deliver him to the real you.

566
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:47,095
Obito.

567
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:50,933
Thanks for rescuing me…

568
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:53,968
And Sasuke too.

569
00:46:56,623 --> 00:46:58,416
Don't thank someone like me.

570
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,234
Just keep an eye on the enemy.

571
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:08,534
So no more masks, huh?

572
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:24,091
I'm…Kakashi's friend,
your father's subordinate,

573
00:47:24,737 --> 00:47:26,655
I'm an Uchiha just like Sasuke…

574
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:28,804
and…

575
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:31,598
<i>The Hokage is someone
who endures pain</i>

576
00:47:31,623 --> 00:47:33,875
<i>and takes the lead
in front of everyone…</i>

577
00:47:34,721 --> 00:47:37,224
<i>There is no shortcut to
becoming the Hokage!</i>

578
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:39,898
<i>There are no ways out for the one
who becomes the Hokage!</i>

579
00:47:40,658 --> 00:47:44,328
<i>The way he forges ahead
draws others towards him.</i>

580
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:47,866
<i>He makes you want to reach out
when he's about to stumble.</i>

581
00:47:51,004 --> 00:47:52,005
I…

582
00:47:52,934 --> 00:47:55,478
I am your senior who dreamt
the same dream as you.

583
00:47:58,232 --> 00:48:02,958
I'm not going to waste time on a
speech, because I'm almost out of time.

584
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:07,257
But…I just ask that you
let me walk in front of you…

585
00:48:16,179 --> 00:48:17,764
and die for you.

586
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:29,559
I'm sorry I'm late.

587
00:48:29,708 --> 00:48:30,918
Have you learned anything yet?

588
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:33,160
There's no one here.

589
00:48:34,005 --> 00:48:37,221
Just the lower half of Madara's body.

590
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:41,101
Does finding Madara's lower half mean

591
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:43,546
that we should
consider him dead?

592
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,214
I have a bad feeling about this…

593
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:54,196
Either way, it seems he completed
his Infinite Tsukuyomi.

594
00:48:55,215 --> 00:48:57,342
And apparently,
it doesn't affect us dead…

595
00:48:59,129 --> 00:49:02,572
In order to verify Madara's status,
and find out what happened,

596
00:49:03,021 --> 00:49:07,182
we should use his lower half
to revive him with the Reanimation Jutsu.

597
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:09,317
Then we'll make him talk.

598
00:49:09,987 --> 00:49:12,543
To do that, we'd need
a living sacrifice!

599
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:14,743
How can you be
so naïve at this point?

600
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,663
There has to be another way!

601
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:38,058
<i>You truly are a kind soul,</i>

602
00:49:39,314 --> 00:49:41,399
<i>previous reincarnate of Ashura.</i>

603
00:49:44,854 --> 00:49:45,938
Wh-Who are you?

604
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:50,487
<i>My name is Hagoromo…</i>

605
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,531
<i>As the founder of Ninshu,
the Ninja Creed…</i>

606
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,742
<i>I am also known as
The Sage of the Six Paths.</i>

607
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,537
You're The Sage of
the Six Paths?

608
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,373
<i>Indeed I am.</i>

609
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,638
<i>Right now, Naruto and
Sasuke have taken on</i>

610
00:50:07,663 --> 00:50:13,211
<i>Ashura and Indra's souls and
are battling my mother Kaguya…</i>

611
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:14,344
Ashura?

612
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:19,057
You just called me
the "previous reincarnate"?

613
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:20,434
<i>Yes…</i>

614
00:50:20,885 --> 00:50:24,180
<i>Ashura and Indra are my two sons.</i>

615
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:28,775
<i>And Kaguya, the one who's
fighting right now, is my mother.</i>

616
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:30,569
What?!

617
00:50:31,411 --> 00:50:36,457
<i>So Ashura and Indra's souls
are connected to you too.</i>

618
00:50:37,124 --> 00:50:40,169
<i>Their souls have transmigrated
over and over again.</i>

619
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:43,290
<i>The soul of Ashura was
previously inside you,</i>

620
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:47,652
<i>and Indra's soul was inside Madara.</i>

621
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:49,087
Inside of me?!

622
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:52,382
<i>Mother took advantage
of their souls,</i>

623
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,384
<i>and after an extraordinary
length of time,</i>

624
00:50:54,409 --> 00:50:56,018
<i>she was resurrected.</i>

625
00:50:56,569 --> 00:51:01,383
<i>Right now, I know everything, even
the intentions of the one called Zetsu,</i>

626
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:05,479
<i>my mother's third son
who possessed Madara.</i>

627
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:08,315
<i>In order to save
Naruto and Sasuke,</i>

628
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:11,719
<i>you, too, must know everything
that has occurred.</i>

629
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:15,687
I see…

630
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:18,784
Sasuke and Naruto are in
an alternate Time-Space

631
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:21,286
as well as Sakura and Kakashi.

632
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,665
<i>Naruto and Sasuke are
the core participants in the battle.</i>

633
00:51:26,122 --> 00:51:30,293
I wish we could have gotten
your advice and aid a bit earlier.

634
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:35,759
<i>This lower body is a part of Madara
after he became the Ten-Tails' Jinchuriki.</i>

635
00:51:36,579 --> 00:51:39,582
<i>In short, it contains Ten-Tails,
Madara and Hashirama…</i>

636
00:51:39,607 --> 00:51:42,234
<i>No, rather Nine-Tails, Madara
and Hashirama.</i>

637
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:45,602
<i>No, rather Nine-Tails,
Indra and Ashura.</i>

638
00:51:45,758 --> 00:51:50,012
<i>I'm only able to emerge like this now
because their chakra is finally one.</i>

639
00:51:50,501 --> 00:51:53,880
Going back to the jutsu
you mentioned earlier,

640
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,696
just what exactly are you doing to do?

641
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:59,624
<i>I will weave the signs for the jutsu.</i>

642
00:52:00,176 --> 00:52:03,263
<i>But this jutsu requires
a vast amount of chakra…</i>

643
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:08,708
<i>which I don't have right now
since I've given it away.</i>

644
00:52:09,851 --> 00:52:13,855
<i>There's very little time.
I ask you to just do as I say.</i>

645
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,386
Keep a hand on me,

646
00:52:20,149 --> 00:52:22,484
so we can teleport to a different
Time-Space at any moment.

647
00:52:23,169 --> 00:52:23,876
Got it.

648
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:41,324
She knows about us, after all.

649
00:52:42,017 --> 00:52:46,421
We have to keep in mind that even if
we jump into her dimension with Kamui,

650
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,492
she'll perceive us.

651
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:54,337
<i>So we're not worth her attention, eh?</i>

652
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:57,465
<i>Yeah, come over here.</i>

653
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:01,344
<i>What you want…
is my chakra, right?!</i>

654
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:07,434
<i>Whatever jutsu I use,
she's just going to absorb it.</i>

655
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:12,480
<i>So what will work best
on her is also…</i>

656
00:53:13,217 --> 00:53:15,011
<i>a feint and taijutsu!</i>

657
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:19,321
<i>I can't use a pervy move
to distract her anymore.</i>

658
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,781
<i>So I gotta go back to the basics</i>

659
00:53:21,806 --> 00:53:23,057
<i>and corner her!</i>

660
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:28,371
<i>If she tries to escape through that
weird window again, I'll enter it with her.</i>

661
00:53:28,784 --> 00:53:31,071
This is my Time-Space.

662
00:53:31,744 --> 00:53:33,829
You are powerless here.

663
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,880
<i>Are you ready, Naruto?</i>

664
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:38,256
Yeah!

665
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:41,426
<i>I'm going to boost your chakra
to the boiling point!</i>

666
00:53:42,114 --> 00:53:43,782
<i>Vapor Style: Unrivalled Strength!</i>

667
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,235
All right!

668
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,179
A-Amazing…

669
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:09,120
<i>I infused chakra for you, Naruto!</i>

670
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,580
Thank you, Kurama!

671
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:14,417
<i>Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

672
00:54:49,571 --> 00:54:53,408
Right now,
this place is my Time-Space!

673
00:54:54,243 --> 00:54:55,244
<i>U...</i>

674
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:56,418
<i>zu...</i>

675
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,503
<i>ma...</i>

676
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:00,463
<i>ki!</i>

677
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:03,550
<i>Naruto</i>

678
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:05,010
<i>Uzumaki</i>

679
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:06,511
<i>Barrage!</i>

680
00:55:10,302 --> 00:55:11,303
<i>It opened!</i>

681
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:15,478
<i>The real me will go!</i>

682
00:55:32,949 --> 00:55:34,574
<i>He forced his way in?</i>

683
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:35,957
<i>Impossible!</i>

684
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:43,298
<i>He disappeared?</i>

685
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:48,303
<i>Looks like several managed
to get in.</i>

686
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:52,140
<i>The other two ran out of power
and faded.</i>

687
00:55:52,713 --> 00:55:56,258
<i>Seems your clones didn't
have enough chakra.</i>

688
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:59,522
<i>Are you the original Naruto?</i>

689
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:01,900
So what if I am?

690
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:07,781
<i>Mother, he's made it all the way
into this Root Time-Space.</i>

691
00:56:08,234 --> 00:56:10,675
<i>It's not good that
he's here in this place</i>

692
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:14,079
<i>that connects directly
to the other five Time-Spaces.</i>

693
00:56:14,722 --> 00:56:17,055
<i>He might be able to get
to where Sasuke is,</i>

694
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:19,665
<i>using the resonance of
the dual opposite powers.</i>

695
00:56:20,789 --> 00:56:23,249
<i>Take that weird jutsu earlier,</i>

696
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:28,009
<i>this shinobi Naruto has
always been unpredictable.</i>

697
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:32,389
<i>We ought to just…
kill him right now!</i>

698
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:35,558
We can't do that.

699
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:39,396
I must absorb
those children's chakra.

700
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:42,540
<i>You use a huge amount of chakra</i>

701
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:46,516
<i>whenever you change
the Time-Space of the world, Mother.</i>

702
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:51,324
<i>You need to preserve the chakra
you've got for an emergency.</i>

703
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:55,537
<i>It's better if you don't keep
engaging him.</i>

704
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:59,124
<i>If you get sealed away,
all will be for naught.</i>

705
00:56:59,213 --> 00:57:02,425
<i>No doubt,
you'll lose a lot of chakra.</i>

706
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:04,786
<i>But you don't need his!</i>

707
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:09,592
<i>It's better than having our long-
cherished plans turn to dust.</i>

708
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,554
You're right.

709
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:17,684
<i>We can kill him with this!</i>

710
00:57:18,057 --> 00:57:20,216
<i>Murderous Bone Ash!</i>

711
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:26,484
<i>Die!</i>

712
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:42,307
<i>Now all of his clones in the
Ice world should be gone as well!</i>

713
00:57:49,584 --> 00:57:51,044
Thanks to Naruto,

714
00:57:51,069 --> 00:57:53,697
we were able to successfully hide
inside my Time-Space.

715
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:56,806
But he's gone, even as a clone.

716
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:00,518
You're the only one
I can rely on, Sakura.

717
00:58:01,347 --> 00:58:02,348
I know!

718
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:14,407
Looks like we succeeded
in getting in, Obito.

719
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:18,703
<i>We killed the original!</i>

720
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,331
<i>So why aren't they gone?</i>

721
00:58:29,394 --> 00:58:31,063
<i>The real me will go!</i>

722
00:58:36,690 --> 00:58:37,597
Damn it!

723
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:39,057
Are you okay, Naruto?

724
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:43,728
How is this okay?!

725
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:47,649
Never mind. Just be ready
when Kaguya comes back.

726
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:57,659
The Kamui worked.

727
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:00,912
They're onto us!

728
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:03,414
I'll draw their attention,

729
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:06,167
so you two go hide
in the meantime!

730
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:08,461
I've marked this spot,

731
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:11,381
so I can hide in my Time-Space
for the time being.

732
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:13,299
You too, Sakura!

733
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:19,639
<i>The other two ran out
of power and faded.</i>

734
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:23,643
<i>Seems your clones didn't
have enough chakra.</i>

735
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:27,355
<i>Are you the original Naruto?</i>

736
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,691
So what if I am?!

737
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:39,492
<i>So they were just
clones back there.</i>

738
00:59:39,728 --> 00:59:41,190
<i>You fooled us.</i>

739
00:59:42,821 --> 00:59:44,097
You got me.

740
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:45,999
I'm…

741
00:59:46,024 --> 00:59:47,234
the original.

742
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:52,130
<i>I've gotta fight smart
and keep them busy</i>

743
00:59:52,155 --> 00:59:53,907
<i>so they don't go back over there.</i>

744
01:00:02,722 --> 01:00:05,850
This Time-Space should be
connected to the others.

745
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:09,772
We'll open them one by one
and look for Sasuke.

746
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:11,149
Right!

747
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:24,329
<i>I'll give him all the chakra I've got!</i>

748
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,966
<i>What an incredibly vast Time-Space…</i>

749
01:00:39,241 --> 01:00:41,827
<i>To be able to connect them
in an instant.</i>

750
01:00:42,566 --> 01:00:43,937
<i>Just who is this Kaguya?!</i>

751
01:00:47,364 --> 01:00:49,992
Isn't that where we were before?

752
01:00:51,070 --> 01:00:54,317
I can't sense Sasuke in there!

753
01:00:59,531 --> 01:01:00,532
Are you all right?

754
01:01:01,739 --> 01:01:02,740
On to the next!

755
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:05,495
Yes!

756
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:11,250
What is…that?

757
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:13,002
He's not here either.

758
01:01:23,134 --> 01:01:25,469
You should rest a bit.

759
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:26,891
What about chakra?

760
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:31,020
Oh...I still have reserves.

761
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:34,305
Keep enough to get back.

762
01:01:35,169 --> 01:01:38,715
If worse comes to worst
and we can't find Sasuke…

763
01:01:38,959 --> 01:01:39,918
We'll find him!

764
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:43,700
Next!

765
01:01:56,491 --> 01:02:00,203
<i>Be careful about making
a gateway, Mother.</i>

766
01:02:00,721 --> 01:02:02,723
<i>Naruto will get closer to Sasuke.</i>

767
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:08,891
<i>Plus, I've figured out something.</i>

768
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:12,476
<i>The original Naruto has
Truthseeker Orbs around him!</i>

769
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:39,630
A sea of acid!

770
01:02:47,996 --> 01:02:49,039
Are you okay?

771
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:50,308
I'm fine!

772
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:51,851
This is nothing.

773
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:57,857
You are a medical ninja,
aren't you?

774
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,610
I'll wait until you heal your wound.

775
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:04,322
That place wasn't
the right one either.

776
01:03:05,464 --> 01:03:06,841
After we rest a little, we'll…

777
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:08,159
Don't worry about it!

778
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:11,887
There's a limit to our chakra, right?

779
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:17,627
Why don't you tend to
your wound?

780
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:19,086
Just a little will…

781
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:23,132
I don't want to waste this chance
that Naruto gave us!

782
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:45,112
He's here!

783
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:46,280
Sasuke!

784
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:49,158
Sasuke!

785
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,619
Over here! Hurry!

786
01:03:54,288 --> 01:03:55,289
<i>Damn it!</i>

787
01:04:04,864 --> 01:04:05,865
Sasuke!

788
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:09,737
Cha!

789
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,268
Sasuke!

790
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:23,025
<i>No way…</i>

791
01:04:37,525 --> 01:04:38,742
How did you do it?

792
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:42,503
It's one of my abilities.

793
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:47,884
I can shift myself between spaces,

794
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:50,928
although only over a finite distance.

795
01:04:53,005 --> 01:04:55,633
But I made it here,
thanks to that.

796
01:04:57,310 --> 01:05:01,606
This man lent me his power.
That's how we were able to get here.

797
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:03,691
He did?

798
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:07,904
Oh no…

799
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:13,409
<i>Damn it...I can't…
Not until I can bring them back…</i>

800
01:05:14,562 --> 01:05:15,605
Hang on!

801
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,497
<i>Will I…</i>

802
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:21,709
<i>break my promise again?</i>

803
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:25,254
<i>Rin?</i>

804
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:34,513
There's still something I must do.

805
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:37,558
We're going back, you two.

806
01:05:39,852 --> 01:05:41,604
Hang on to me.

807
01:05:41,979 --> 01:05:42,980
All right!

808
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:05,169
<i>There's no mistake.</i>

809
01:06:07,137 --> 01:06:08,347
<i>Those things…</i>

810
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:11,133
<i>They cut down
the Shadow Clones earlier.</i>

811
01:06:19,464 --> 01:06:22,092
<i>The Clones are desperately
protecting that one.</i>

812
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:24,855
<i>There's no mistake, Mother.</i>

813
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:29,068
<i>The one with the Truthseeker Orbs
behind him is the real one!</i>

814
01:06:41,038 --> 01:06:42,206
There's no end to them!

815
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:59,521
<i>Am I powerless to do
anything but watch?</i>

816
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,609
<i>What am I doing wallowing,
when Naruto's fighting so hard?</i>

817
01:07:11,199 --> 01:07:12,450
<i>That's why I'm never any good.</i>

818
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:16,574
<i>There should be something
I can still do!</i>

819
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,121
Obito!

820
01:07:27,609 --> 01:07:29,986
<i>Impossible!
It's Sasuke!</i>

821
01:07:31,922 --> 01:07:32,923
He's here!

822
01:07:43,919 --> 01:07:46,242
Now, there's nothing to worry about.

823
01:07:52,943 --> 01:07:53,652
No way!

824
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:54,820
Naruto!

825
01:07:58,616 --> 01:08:00,659
<i>Why you!</i>

826
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:04,163
<i>He passed the Truthseeker Orbs
to a clone?</i>

827
01:08:04,596 --> 01:08:06,765
<i>We fell for something so simple!</i>

828
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:10,252
Thank you, Sakura and Obito!

829
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:12,630
What? You're okay?

830
01:08:12,924 --> 01:08:14,675
You scared us there!

831
01:08:17,850 --> 01:08:18,851
Sasuke!

832
01:08:19,218 --> 01:08:21,929
Did you thank
Sakura and Obito properly?

833
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:24,391
Focus on the enemy!

834
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:29,271
<i>Well, Naruto was always
unexpectedly cunning.</i>

835
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:31,649
<i>Mother…</i>

836
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:35,111
<i>Since they've reunited,
we have no other choice.</i>

837
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:39,615
<i>We can't afford to be stingy
with our chakra.</i>

838
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:41,492
I know that.

839
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:03,139
<i>My body feels so heavy.</i>

840
01:09:03,624 --> 01:09:06,543
<i>This terrain…
is digging into my body!</i>

841
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:13,524
I can't levitate!

842
01:09:14,294 --> 01:09:16,504
<i>A heavy gravity plane this time!</i>

843
01:09:17,725 --> 01:09:18,726
<i>Except…</i>

844
01:09:20,022 --> 01:09:21,821
<i>She's affected too.</i>

845
01:09:36,797 --> 01:09:37,798
Oh no!

846
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:45,164
<i>Damn it! The visual prowess
in my left eye hasn't…</i>

847
01:09:47,572 --> 01:09:49,240
Dodge it, Sasuke!

848
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:58,569
<i>Is the heavy gravity distorting your aim?</i>

849
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:02,781
I've now adjusted for it.
I won't miss with the next one.

850
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,742
I won't let you!

851
01:10:15,502 --> 01:10:18,547
<i>There's something that I can still do.</i>

852
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:25,304
<i>I can at least be a shield for them!</i>

853
01:10:29,524 --> 01:10:31,526
– <i>Let me make it in time!</i>
– <i>Let me make it in time!</i>

854
01:10:57,975 --> 01:10:58,976
– <i>Rin!</i>
– <i>Rin!</i>

855
01:11:02,049 --> 01:11:03,759
<i>Again, you…</i>

856
01:11:04,801 --> 01:11:06,344
<i>Thank you, Rin.</i>

857
01:11:07,471 --> 01:11:10,641
<i>Obito and I will be joining you soon.</i>

858
01:11:11,308 --> 01:11:14,561
<i>We can catch up then…
together, the three of us.</i>

859
01:11:17,828 --> 01:11:18,912
<i>Rin…</i>

860
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:21,402
<i>This time, when I get there…</i>

861
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:26,782
<i>Let's spend some alone time together,
just you and me.</i>

862
01:11:43,339 --> 01:11:44,882
<i>Kakashi would just be in the way.</i>

863
01:11:45,962 --> 01:11:47,630
<i>I'm gonna leave him here.</i>

864
01:11:54,518 --> 01:11:56,061
<i>This is…Kamui!</i>

865
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:02,192
Obito! You!

866
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:08,657
Kakashi...You stay here
a little while longer.

867
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:15,331
Don't you rush to follow us!

868
01:12:24,530 --> 01:12:25,697
Why?

869
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:28,302
I thought we had both resolved to…

870
01:12:29,407 --> 01:12:31,951
Your power is still needed here!

871
01:12:39,958 --> 01:12:42,752
<i>We need to rebuild chakra again.</i>

872
01:12:43,696 --> 01:12:46,658
<i>Mother, let's teleport to
the Root Time-Space…</i>

873
01:12:46,791 --> 01:12:49,335
<i>You'll recover faster there, too.</i>

874
01:12:50,341 --> 01:12:52,551
Why would you do this
for someone useless like me?

875
01:12:53,594 --> 01:12:54,929
Never mind that.

876
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:57,498
Kakashi, be wary of the enemy.

877
01:13:10,675 --> 01:13:14,168
<i>Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura…</i>

878
01:13:14,746 --> 01:13:17,416
<i>This is a crucial time for them.</i>

879
01:13:18,207 --> 01:13:22,211
<i>Kakashi, you must survive
and support the next generation.</i>

880
01:13:22,236 --> 01:13:23,821
<i>It's too soon for you to die.</i>

881
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:32,533
<i>It's totally useless, Naruto.</i>

882
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:35,285
<i>He's a goner.</i>

883
01:13:35,452 --> 01:13:37,788
<i>He'll rot away like trash and die.</i>

884
01:13:38,587 --> 01:13:39,713
Enough, Naruto.

885
01:13:40,343 --> 01:13:42,053
He's right.

886
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:44,211
Don't waste your chakra.

887
01:13:45,212 --> 01:13:48,298
<i>Why do you sympathize with him?</i>

888
01:13:48,323 --> 01:13:51,493
<i>He was originally your enemy, right?</i>

889
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:56,432
<i>Then again,
he's a traitor to us now.</i>

890
01:13:56,557 --> 01:13:59,226
<i>A loser on both sides.</i>

891
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:03,080
<i>Hated and resented
by friend and foe alike,</i>

892
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:06,358
<i>with no one to call
comrade or family…</i>

893
01:14:06,656 --> 01:14:09,826
<i>He's alone, with nothing left.</i>

894
01:14:10,128 --> 01:14:11,964
<i>He's lost everyone precious to him,</i>

895
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:14,633
<i>and he can't realize his dreams.</i>

896
01:14:14,877 --> 01:14:18,631
<i>And after being used up,
he's helpless at the end…</i>

897
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:21,874
<i>He's a fool, filled with
nothing but mistakes…</i>

898
01:14:21,899 --> 01:14:23,291
You've done nothing but—!

899
01:14:23,316 --> 01:14:24,442
You're right…

900
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:29,089
It's an end worthy of
the criminal that I am.

901
01:14:34,394 --> 01:14:35,979
<i>My visual prowess is back!</i>

902
01:14:55,089 --> 01:14:56,674
We've been here before!

903
01:14:56,937 --> 01:14:58,814
Did she change worlds again?!

904
01:15:06,416 --> 01:15:07,459
Naruto!

905
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:10,589
Naruto, I'll handle
the diversions this time.

906
01:15:11,091 --> 01:15:12,843
He's beyond help.

907
01:15:13,395 --> 01:15:14,396
Come with me.

908
01:15:19,175 --> 01:15:20,482
I'm going on ahead!

909
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:30,692
Damn it! Damn it!

910
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:33,028
Damn it!

911
01:15:39,618 --> 01:15:40,619
That's enough.

912
01:15:41,328 --> 01:15:42,915
Thank you, Naruto

913
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:50,671
After fighting you,
I feel like I've woken up.

914
01:15:51,395 --> 01:15:56,859
Imagining the village, friends,
and me as the Hokage…

915
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:59,111
Even after all that's happened…

916
01:15:59,937 --> 01:16:04,650
Just the thought of it seems to
fill up the hole in my heart.

917
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:09,189
Maybe it's because it's the end,

918
01:16:10,148 --> 01:16:13,318
I find myself rambling all of a sudden.

919
01:16:17,958 --> 01:16:18,959
Ouch!

920
01:16:24,771 --> 01:16:26,982
Don't act tough and
hide your wounds.

921
01:16:28,113 --> 01:16:29,990
I'm always watching you.

922
01:16:31,788 --> 01:16:35,000
You promised me that
you would become Hokage, Obito.

923
01:16:36,049 --> 01:16:39,639
Listen, I want to stop this war too.

924
01:16:39,664 --> 01:16:42,542
I really want to save the world.

925
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:48,647
So I've decided to stick by
your side and watch over you.

926
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:53,338
You told me saving you

927
01:16:53,363 --> 01:16:55,741
was the same as saving
the world, remember?

928
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:04,077
Yeah!

929
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:07,164
Since I'm keeping an eye on you,

930
01:17:07,372 --> 01:17:10,042
you can't hide anything
from me anymore.

931
01:17:10,208 --> 01:17:12,210
Okay! Okay!

932
01:17:13,503 --> 01:17:15,130
Go for it, Obito!

933
01:17:16,089 --> 01:17:20,010
Become Hokage and show me
how you'll save the world.

934
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:22,137
That's another promise!

935
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:24,473
Let's go!

936
01:17:33,516 --> 01:17:38,062
A lot more suffering
likely awaits you, Naruto.

937
01:17:38,445 --> 01:17:42,324
But don't ever change

938
01:17:42,681 --> 01:17:44,941
and hang on to your ninja way.

939
01:17:45,766 --> 01:17:47,438
You once told me that

940
01:17:48,353 --> 01:17:54,984
never going back on your word
is your ninja way, right?

941
01:17:55,821 --> 01:17:56,670
Yeah…

942
01:18:07,373 --> 01:18:08,624
Naruto…

943
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:11,770
You better...

944
01:18:12,669 --> 01:18:14,754
become Hokage!

945
01:18:16,983 --> 01:18:18,110
Yeah!

946
01:18:49,066 --> 01:18:52,689
<i>The vermin traitor has
finally died, eh?</i>

947
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:57,398
<i>He was vermin and
persistent as a cockroach.</i>

948
01:19:00,677 --> 01:19:02,387
Don't laugh at Obito!

949
01:19:05,222 --> 01:19:06,122
Naruto…

950
01:19:06,916 --> 01:19:08,636
<i>Naruto…</i>

951
01:19:08,685 --> 01:19:11,121
<i>If you keep resisting,</i>

952
01:19:11,195 --> 01:19:15,953
<i>you'll end up pitifully crumbling
to ash just like him!</i>

953
01:19:16,741 --> 01:19:19,353
As someone who tried
to become Hokage,

954
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:20,972
Obito is nothing but…

955
01:19:24,217 --> 01:19:26,470
awesome to me!

956
01:19:31,266 --> 01:19:32,309
<i>I can't move!</i>

957
01:19:34,942 --> 01:19:37,278
<i>I don't even have
much strength left,</i>

958
01:19:37,551 --> 01:19:39,303
<i>and yet, I was left behind again?</i>

959
01:19:43,906 --> 01:19:44,700
Rin!

960
01:19:45,064 --> 01:19:46,148
I've been waiting.

961
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:48,283
Really?

962
01:19:48,851 --> 01:19:50,185
Sorry, I made you wait.

963
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:52,954
Seems you got lost along the way.

964
01:19:53,623 --> 01:19:54,436
Yeah…

965
01:19:55,029 --> 01:19:57,388
A lot of things happened
before I could come here.

966
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:04,049
Rin, you know...

967
01:20:05,104 --> 01:20:06,917
that promise I made to you…

968
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:11,056
No, you did your best!

969
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:16,937
I've been watching you all along!

970
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:26,029
Let's go!

971
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:37,541
This is embarrassing…
Screwing up like that in front of you.

972
01:20:39,406 --> 01:20:41,575
It looks like
you've calmed down a bit.

973
01:20:46,130 --> 01:20:47,465
Okay, Obito.

974
01:20:49,344 --> 01:20:52,848
Rin, do you mind waiting
just a bit longer?

975
01:20:53,419 --> 01:20:54,420
Obito?

976
01:20:55,502 --> 01:20:58,963
Only a little bit before
we move on…

977
01:20:59,477 --> 01:21:01,771
I'd like to make one more
detour along the way.

978
01:21:04,241 --> 01:21:06,202
Who do you want to save this time?

979
01:21:07,786 --> 01:21:08,787
Kakashi.

980
01:21:10,087 --> 01:21:12,214
I've finally gotten alone time with you.

981
01:21:12,846 --> 01:21:15,223
It'll be wasted if he ends up
coming here right away.

982
01:21:16,290 --> 01:21:20,252
Besides...He's out there helpless.

983
01:21:20,584 --> 01:21:23,753
Just like his namesake, he's a scarecrow
in the middle of a garden…

984
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:25,657
And I'm sort of annoyed by it.

985
01:21:27,613 --> 01:21:31,367
Despite all that's happened,
you two are still close, huh?

986
01:21:31,469 --> 01:21:33,889
N-No way!

987
01:21:34,081 --> 01:21:36,333
We're oil and water!

988
01:21:38,333 --> 01:21:39,251
So?

989
01:21:39,619 --> 01:21:40,912
You can go just like that?

990
01:21:40,937 --> 01:21:41,938
Yeah…

991
01:21:42,154 --> 01:21:45,532
Chakra is an energy
that connects two worlds.

992
01:21:46,453 --> 01:21:47,704
I'm gonna go see Kakashi!

993
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:50,947
I'll be waiting right here.

994
01:21:51,063 --> 01:21:53,941
Sorry, Rin!
I'll be right back!

995
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:07,172
Obito?!

996
01:22:08,093 --> 01:22:11,597
Before I go to the next world,
I thought I'd emphasize to you…

997
01:22:11,747 --> 01:22:13,958
to not to come
running after me so quickly.

998
01:22:17,431 --> 01:22:19,507
Besides, it's going to
keep bothering me

999
01:22:19,532 --> 01:22:22,952
if this eye I gave you to
celebrate your promotion to jonin,

1000
01:22:22,977 --> 01:22:24,437
came back to me.

1001
01:22:25,201 --> 01:22:27,578
Obito, you…

1002
01:22:27,896 --> 01:22:31,608
Then again, it's not like I'll be
springing back to life anymore.

1003
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:33,865
More importantly,

1004
01:22:33,890 --> 01:22:37,185
you know how I told Naruto
to become Hokage?

1005
01:22:38,133 --> 01:22:39,676
I meant to say as the Seventh.

1006
01:22:41,331 --> 01:22:45,710
You be the Sixth Hokage, Kakashi.

1007
01:22:47,212 --> 01:22:51,591
I know you haven't taken office yet,
but I'm giving you your gift now.

1008
01:22:52,139 --> 01:22:55,183
It has a fixed time limit,
but it isn't useless.

1009
01:22:56,388 --> 01:22:57,764
Do you get what I'm saying?

1010
01:22:58,431 --> 01:23:01,059
I mean…you haven't forgotten
your famous nickname

1011
01:23:01,084 --> 01:23:03,587
that's known throughout
the lands, have you?

1012
01:23:04,259 --> 01:23:06,720
That name, Kakashi of the Sharingan!

1013
01:23:22,914 --> 01:23:24,211
<i>Let's do this, guys!</i>

1014
01:23:28,586 --> 01:23:29,403
<i>Mmhm.</i>

1015
01:23:31,131 --> 01:23:32,013
<i>Yes!</i>

1016
01:23:33,591 --> 01:23:34,423
<i>Yup!</i>

1017
01:23:36,091 --> 01:23:37,000
<i>All right!</i>

1018
01:23:37,626 --> 01:23:38,556
<i>Roger.</i>

1019
01:23:39,347 --> 01:23:40,213
<i>Sure thing!</i>

1020
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:41,775
<i>Gotcha!</i>

1021
01:23:42,392 --> 01:23:43,175
<i>Yeah!</i>

1022
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:44,566
<i>Here we go!</i>

1023
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:55,531
<i>Sage Art: Super Tailed Beast
Rasen-Shuriken!</i>

1024
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:08,710
Nice, Naruto!

1025
01:24:13,805 --> 01:24:17,402
<i>There's no way they can
come out of that unscathed.</i>

1026
01:24:29,522 --> 01:24:31,983
<i>Oh no! Don't tell me Mother's—!</i>

1027
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:33,902
What's that?

1028
01:24:44,284 --> 01:24:47,162
She turned into
another gigantic thing?

1029
01:24:47,582 --> 01:24:48,583
What is that?

1030
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:50,877
A wolf? Tanuki?

1031
01:24:51,458 --> 01:24:53,877
Badger? Or a rabbit?

1032
01:24:54,214 --> 01:24:57,425
It doesn't matter.
Now it's easier to get close.

1033
01:24:58,302 --> 01:24:59,887
And it'll be easier to seal her!

1034
01:25:00,413 --> 01:25:03,082
<i>Are the Tailed Beasts
within her resonating</i>

1035
01:25:03,107 --> 01:25:06,026
<i>in response to Naruto's attack
and starting to split apart?</i>

1036
01:25:06,250 --> 01:25:07,880
<i>They're not stable!</i>

1037
01:25:19,447 --> 01:25:22,117
Sasuke, don't get grabbed
by that white hand!

1038
01:25:22,256 --> 01:25:24,123
It will absorb you instantly!

1039
01:25:24,148 --> 01:25:25,220
And it's fast too!

1040
01:25:25,245 --> 01:25:26,246
I know that!

1041
01:25:33,002 --> 01:25:34,045
Sasuke!

1042
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:36,172
Protect Sakura with
your visual prowess!

1043
01:25:44,848 --> 01:25:46,516
All right, way to go!

1044
01:25:46,541 --> 01:25:48,752
A Susano'o?! Whose was it?

1045
01:25:48,958 --> 01:25:52,169
W-What? That wasn't you?!

1046
01:25:53,338 --> 01:25:54,732
<i>What's going on?!</i>

1047
01:25:58,027 --> 01:25:59,154
Kakashi Sensei!

1048
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:02,824
<i>Thank you…Obito.</i>

1049
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:06,008
That's impossible. No way!

1050
01:26:06,244 --> 01:26:08,037
Sure it is!

1051
01:26:08,264 --> 01:26:12,535
We are talking about the Copy Ninja,
Kakashi of the Sharingan!

1052
01:26:13,042 --> 01:26:15,420
But he shouldn't have
the Sharingan anymore…

1053
01:26:16,087 --> 01:26:18,423
I don't get it, but he saved me!

1054
01:26:20,466 --> 01:26:22,594
<i>You watch along with me.</i>

1055
01:26:23,761 --> 01:26:25,242
<i>This time, I'll protect them…</i>

1056
01:26:26,410 --> 01:26:27,828
<i>and the world!</i>

1057
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:43,907
Here it comes!

1058
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:48,328
<i>How about this?</i>

1059
01:26:48,882 --> 01:26:50,747
<i>Combining the power
of the Kamui into…</i>

1060
01:26:50,772 --> 01:26:51,982
<i>shuriken!</i>

1061
01:26:52,957 --> 01:26:54,292
<i>Kamui Shuriken!</i>

1062
01:27:06,304 --> 01:27:07,430
<i>Just as I thought…</i>

1063
01:27:08,306 --> 01:27:11,559
<i>Gaining Six Path's power enhances
one's visual prowess too!</i>

1064
01:27:12,488 --> 01:27:15,199
<i>This power…
It's Obito's Sharingan?</i>

1065
01:27:15,602 --> 01:27:17,354
<i>But why does
Kakashi Sensei have it?</i>

1066
01:27:18,316 --> 01:27:19,317
Wow!

1067
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:21,486
That's more amazing
than yours, Sasuke!

1068
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:23,738
<i>This chakra is—!</i>

1069
01:28:00,072 --> 01:28:02,950
<i>This Root Time-Space is
Mother's exclusive domain,</i>

1070
01:28:02,975 --> 01:28:05,964
<i>where she can
directly extract chakra</i>

1071
01:28:05,989 --> 01:28:09,867
<i>from shinobi trapped in
the Infinite Tsukuyomi!</i>

1072
01:28:09,892 --> 01:28:11,953
<i>The Tailed Beasts are now stable,</i>

1073
01:28:11,978 --> 01:28:14,731
<i>and Mother has even produced
a Truthseeker Orb…</i>

1074
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:18,851
<i>An Expansive Kekkei Moura
Truthseeker Orb</i>

1075
01:28:18,876 --> 01:28:21,045
<i>that contains
each and every nature…</i>

1076
01:28:21,070 --> 01:28:23,280
<i>Wind, fire, earth, lightning,
water, shadow, and light.</i>

1077
01:28:23,527 --> 01:28:25,824
<i>It is the beginning of
a new Time-Space.</i>

1078
01:28:25,918 --> 01:28:28,963
<i>And you all will
become its sacrifice!</i>

1079
01:28:30,295 --> 01:28:31,379
That thing!

1080
01:28:31,472 --> 01:28:33,842
It's the same sphere
as the one behind me!

1081
01:28:33,867 --> 01:28:35,660
The difference in size is too drastic!

1082
01:28:35,883 --> 01:28:38,302
And it's growing rapidly!

1083
01:28:39,661 --> 01:28:42,873
I definitely can't teleport away such
a gigantic object with the Kamui.

1084
01:28:44,002 --> 01:28:47,589
Even if we get out of this Time-Space
and escape temporarily…

1085
01:28:48,397 --> 01:28:52,693
If that thing becomes too big,
we won't be able to return here.

1086
01:28:53,404 --> 01:28:54,947
In order to stop that…

1087
01:28:55,184 --> 01:28:59,647
We need to seal
that Rabbit Granny away right now!

1088
01:28:59,725 --> 01:29:00,726
You're right.

1089
01:29:01,047 --> 01:29:03,008
Gather 'round. I've got a plan.

1090
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:09,344
This will be our last mission
as the former Squad 7!

1091
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:21,105
We're going to save the world!

1092
01:29:21,872 --> 01:29:22,498
Yeah!

1093
01:29:22,648 --> 01:29:23,649
Roger!

1094
01:29:25,603 --> 01:29:27,564
I am immortal.

1095
01:29:27,872 --> 01:29:31,542
If either of you die,
you cannot seal me away.

1096
01:29:32,037 --> 01:29:33,038
Now then...

1097
01:29:36,454 --> 01:29:38,247
Which shall it be?

1098
01:29:39,878 --> 01:29:41,880
You're mine, damn it!

1099
01:29:42,168 --> 01:29:43,961
No, we attack her together.

1100
01:29:44,128 --> 01:29:47,507
She's scared of being sealed
and her attention will be divided!

1101
01:29:47,803 --> 01:29:49,972
Take me part of the way.
Then I'll fly the rest of the way.

1102
01:29:50,004 --> 01:29:51,005
Right!

1103
01:30:01,521 --> 01:30:02,522
<i>So fast!</i>

1104
01:30:03,825 --> 01:30:05,994
<i>Mother just gained more power.</i>

1105
01:30:06,449 --> 01:30:09,468
<i>Both her power and speed
are now exponentially greater!</i>

1106
01:30:22,838 --> 01:30:27,494
<i>Being able to pass through things,
really is a handy ability, Obito…</i>

1107
01:30:29,816 --> 01:30:31,902
<i>And now, I can resurrect this move too!</i>

1108
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:38,683
<i>Kamui Lightning Blade!</i>

1109
01:30:41,014 --> 01:30:42,015
<i>Mother!</i>

1110
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:44,355
<i>This is bad!
Her right arm!</i>

1111
01:30:54,797 --> 01:30:59,302
<i>There's not enough time to escape
into another Time-Space!</i>

1112
01:30:59,776 --> 01:31:00,774
<i>Then!</i>

1113
01:31:14,331 --> 01:31:17,751
<i>So they were both
Ashura's reincarnates, after all.</i>

1114
01:31:18,806 --> 01:31:21,517
<i>They must have,
switched back then.</i>

1115
01:31:21,934 --> 01:31:25,229
<i>So then, the one on the right
is the real one!</i>

1116
01:31:33,488 --> 01:31:34,697
<i>Kamui!</i>

1117
01:31:54,133 --> 01:31:54,967
<i>Not good.</i>

1118
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:06,312
<i>Don't forget about me!</i>

1119
01:32:06,395 --> 01:32:09,190
<i>We're both women,
so don't mock me!</i>

1120
01:32:12,572 --> 01:32:15,909
<i>Naruto…Sasuke…Sakura!</i>

1121
01:32:17,532 --> 01:32:21,577
<i>You guys make
a nice picture right now.</i>

1122
01:32:23,869 --> 01:32:25,065
<i>I really love you guys!</i>

1123
01:32:25,916 --> 01:32:26,781
Now!

1124
01:32:27,124 --> 01:32:28,428
Cha!

1125
01:32:28,709 --> 01:32:29,922
All right!

1126
01:32:39,387 --> 01:32:41,681
<i>Six Paths Planetary Devastation!</i>

1127
01:32:44,331 --> 01:32:49,249
<i>To think that I,
the originator of chakra…</i>

1128
01:32:49,867 --> 01:32:55,258
<i>would be defeated by pieces of
my own chakra, again…</i>

1129
01:33:00,616 --> 01:33:02,259
<i>Why?!</i>

1130
01:33:07,784 --> 01:33:10,537
<i>Hmm? They've done it!</i>

1131
01:33:11,304 --> 01:33:14,765
<i>All that's left is to bring
you all back!</i>

1132
01:33:57,381 --> 01:33:59,842
Is the ground being
sucked up towards her?

1133
01:34:08,421 --> 01:34:10,173
<i>We finally made it out!</i>

1134
01:34:10,985 --> 01:34:15,656
<i>Kurama, your Jinchuriki's pretty good.</i>

1135
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:39,885
Over here!

1136
01:34:45,971 --> 01:34:47,264
Sasuke!

1137
01:34:48,808 --> 01:34:50,142
What happened to Naruto?

1138
01:34:51,811 --> 01:34:55,356
He went off by himself, saying there
was something he had to take care of.

1139
01:34:55,648 --> 01:34:58,734
More importantly, we need to
get farther away from here!

1140
01:35:01,487 --> 01:35:04,115
<i>At this point, it can't be helped.</i>

1141
01:35:04,198 --> 01:35:07,159
<i>I'll just start over and work on
Mother's next resurrection!</i>

1142
01:35:09,036 --> 01:35:10,371
That reminds me,

1143
01:35:10,454 --> 01:35:13,165
you don't like being separated
from your mom, right?

1144
01:35:13,431 --> 01:35:15,367
<i>D-Damn you!</i>

1145
01:35:16,185 --> 01:35:18,020
I haven't forgotten about you.

1146
01:35:18,045 --> 01:35:21,741
Hiding in the shadows
and creeping around for all this time!

1147
01:35:23,318 --> 01:35:24,527
<i>You!</i>

1148
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:28,115
<i>You're just a piece of
the shinobi history I created.</i>

1149
01:35:28,268 --> 01:35:30,944
<i>A brat like you could never…!</i>

1150
01:35:33,102 --> 01:35:34,687
History?

1151
01:35:37,389 --> 01:35:40,302
Shinobi history…

1152
01:35:41,235 --> 01:35:44,806
consists of all sorts of ninja's lives,
and deaths!

1153
01:35:45,816 --> 01:35:49,717
Many shinobi taught me
what it means to be a shinobi.

1154
01:35:50,728 --> 01:35:54,119
The pain and sadness of death…
the tragedy of war.

1155
01:35:54,563 --> 01:35:55,899
And not only that!

1156
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:59,962
They taught me the joy of
being accepted and being loved!

1157
01:36:08,012 --> 01:36:10,961
The way they lived…
and the way they died…

1158
01:36:11,652 --> 01:36:13,490
made me who I am!

1159
01:36:14,328 --> 01:36:17,021
They taught me and trusted me!

1160
01:36:17,938 --> 01:36:20,441
You're a brat who
can't even leave the nest!

1161
01:36:21,484 --> 01:36:24,361
Get over yourself!

1162
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:46,091
It's still growing.

1163
01:36:46,258 --> 01:36:48,302
It's like a moon.

1164
01:36:50,971 --> 01:36:52,181
Guys!

1165
01:36:52,352 --> 01:36:53,570
It's over.

1166
01:36:54,141 --> 01:36:55,935
The seal is complete!

1167
01:36:56,143 --> 01:36:58,771
We can finally celebrate!

1168
01:36:58,946 --> 01:37:00,114
You're right.

1169
01:37:02,509 --> 01:37:04,305
The first thing I want is a hot bath

1170
01:37:04,336 --> 01:37:06,963
to wash away all
this sweat and grime.

1171
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:10,616
Hold on a sec!
What about us?!

1172
01:37:10,641 --> 01:37:13,009
How are we supposed to
get out of this Time-Space?!

1173
01:37:13,034 --> 01:37:15,870
Oh no! You're right!
This is bad! This is bad!

1174
01:37:16,016 --> 01:37:17,935
<i>He does whatever
needs to get done.</i>

1175
01:37:18,123 --> 01:37:20,751
<i>But he's still pretty dumb, isn't he?</i>

1176
01:37:37,499 --> 01:37:39,210
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

1177
01:38:06,297 --> 01:38:08,382
Welcome home, Naruto.

1178
01:38:10,259 --> 01:38:11,260
Dad…

1179
01:38:18,142 --> 01:38:20,269
Naruto, who's this?

1180
01:38:20,661 --> 01:38:22,178
Six Paths Super Gramps!

1181
01:38:22,703 --> 01:38:23,756
Which means…

1182
01:38:24,305 --> 01:38:26,801
<i>That's right,
you're back in your world</i>

1183
01:38:27,568 --> 01:38:31,447
<i>through a Summoning performed
by all prior Five Kage together.</i>

1184
01:38:32,407 --> 01:38:35,342
<i>I called all of
the previous Five Kage</i>

1185
01:38:35,367 --> 01:38:37,912
<i>from the afterworld to help.</i>

1186
01:38:41,123 --> 01:38:43,584
<i>Naruto, Sasuke…</i>

1187
01:38:43,667 --> 01:38:45,753
<i>and the rest of you…</i>

1188
01:38:46,128 --> 01:38:49,002
<i>Excellent work saving the world.</i>
