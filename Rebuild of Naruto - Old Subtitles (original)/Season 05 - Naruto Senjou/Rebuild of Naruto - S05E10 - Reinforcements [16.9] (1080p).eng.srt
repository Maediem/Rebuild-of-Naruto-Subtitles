1
00:00:38,613 --> 00:00:40,239
Retreat...Retreat!

2
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:04,157
The chakra threads of world-class
Puppet Masters can control humans

3
00:01:04,182 --> 00:01:06,797
as well as their puppets.

4
00:01:07,981 --> 00:01:12,237
But once the chakra thread is cut,
there's no harm to the human.

5
00:01:13,089 --> 00:01:14,090
I'm indebted to you.

6
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,826
I was about to slay an ally.

7
00:01:18,015 --> 00:01:21,477
There's a special way to fight
between Puppet Users.

8
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,834
And I'm the only one here
who can do this…

9
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:27,318
Right, Granny Chiyo?!

10
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,112
Your technique is as sharp as ever.

11
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,322
But you don't have any fighting spirit!

12
00:01:54,642 --> 00:01:58,270
I guess Puppet Masters aren't good
at being a puppet, eh?

13
00:01:58,831 --> 00:02:01,959
Inexperienced ones shouldn't act
as if they know…

14
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,000
Don't make light of
the Reanimation Jutsu.

15
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,419
If the user of the jutsu gets serious…

16
00:02:11,201 --> 00:02:12,730
Oh, speak of the devil!

17
00:02:21,232 --> 00:02:22,555
<i>Reverse Secret White Technique:</i>

18
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,708
<i>Esematsu's Ten Puppets!</i>

19
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,210
What?!

20
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,141
Wires?

21
00:02:43,828 --> 00:02:44,647
Wha—?!

22
00:02:54,248 --> 00:02:56,959
<i>So he shares a love and
passion for puppets,</i>

23
00:02:56,984 --> 00:02:58,902
<i>just like Sasori did?</i>

24
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,325
Sasori's soul dwells in
these two puppets!

25
00:03:03,244 --> 00:03:07,874
And his love instilled the souls
of his parents in them too!

26
00:03:10,173 --> 00:03:13,051
Sasori, at least, was able to feel it.

27
00:03:13,765 --> 00:03:15,684
Puppets with souls?!

28
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,031
That's not all, Granny Chiyo…

29
00:03:18,635 --> 00:03:21,221
The love you gave to
his Father and Mother puppets

30
00:03:21,382 --> 00:03:23,718
became a part of their souls.

31
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:24,966
Huh?

32
00:03:25,351 --> 00:03:26,936
Sasori was aware of that.

33
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,843
And he gave them all to me…

34
00:03:30,636 --> 00:03:33,843
Rather, he entrusted them to me for
future generations of the shinobi world.

35
00:03:34,892 --> 00:03:38,771
Passing it on is our duty too.

36
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,054
Sasori did that…?

37
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:45,108
Sure, I'm inexperienced and
in your eyes, a stranger.

38
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,310
But my kid brother…

39
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,854
Gaara received your soul
and came back to life.

40
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,856
So I'm not a stranger at all.

41
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:56,027
And I can sense it through
the chakra threads.

42
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,321
Sasori and his mother and father…

43
00:03:58,422 --> 00:03:59,882
The family's thoughts, their love…

44
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,033
Their souls are saying…

45
00:04:02,737 --> 00:04:04,739
"Please stop Granny Chiyo!"

46
00:04:24,888 --> 00:04:26,890
We can't retreat any further.

47
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,852
We'll have to make our stand here!

48
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,854
I agree.

49
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:35,316
First, the two of us will launch
long-range offensives.

50
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,777
We'll see how the enemy responds!

51
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,740
They were slowly retreating,

52
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,118
but it seems they've made up
their minds.

53
00:04:45,858 --> 00:04:47,943
Fighting those from other villages
is understandable.

54
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,414
But we are forced to
bring ourselves

55
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,957
to take on shinobi from
our homelands.

56
00:04:51,414 --> 00:04:55,293
Damn that brat Orochimaru
for controlling us!

57
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,480
He will regret this!

58
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,133
I never saw eye to eye
with you before,

59
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,051
but for the first time,
I agree with you.

60
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,762
Do not lament.

61
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:09,642
I'm certain our children have grown
and surpassed us.

62
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,020
I hope you are right…

63
00:05:15,537 --> 00:05:16,538
Here they come.

64
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,027
First, two of them.

65
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,994
Look at those
amazing waves of sand!

66
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,495
<i>This is Shukaku…</i>

67
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:30,638
<i>The power of the One Tail…</i>

68
00:05:33,642 --> 00:05:36,270
<i>So they're starting off with
the Playing Possum Jutsu?</i>

69
00:05:40,408 --> 00:05:41,534
Gold Dust?

70
00:05:42,724 --> 00:05:43,766
I see…

71
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,777
You were the shinobi
who manipulated Gold Dust

72
00:05:46,802 --> 00:05:47,970
with the Magnet Style…

73
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:57,940
It stopped.

74
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:00,595
Gold Dust is heavier than sand…

75
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:05,198
If I mix Gold Dust into
the sand, I can slow it down.

76
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:09,452
I'm impressed that you knew
how to counter it.

77
00:06:10,547 --> 00:06:12,841
When Shukaku the One Tail
would go on a rampage,

78
00:06:13,168 --> 00:06:15,170
I'd stop his sand like this.

79
00:06:24,643 --> 00:06:27,438
<i>It's not Shukaku…but Gaara?!</i>

80
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,022
From above…

81
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,028
You've aged, Ohnoki!

82
00:06:44,974 --> 00:06:46,850
Do you owe your long life
to the Particle Style?

83
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:48,825
– <i>Particle Style:</i>
– <i>Particle Style:</i>

84
00:06:49,018 --> 00:06:50,503
– <i>Atomic Dismantling Jutsu!</i>
– <i>Atomic Dismantling Jutsu!</i>

85
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:04,799
My predecessor's Particle Style…
is as powerful as ever.

86
00:07:05,712 --> 00:07:08,423
<i>The sand is even more powerful
than before…</i>

87
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:15,768
Wait for the signal.

88
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,979
Particle Style…

89
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,957
Don't tell me that's
your former pupil, the brat Ohnoki?

90
00:07:21,861 --> 00:07:24,489
Now I really feel like
I traveled through time!

91
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,697
It's been a while…Father.

92
00:07:28,344 --> 00:07:30,680
Gaara...Where's Shukaku?

93
00:07:31,331 --> 00:07:33,207
He's long gone.

94
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:39,876
I am no longer the Jinchuriki
that you created, Father.

95
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,435
You're no longer a Jinchuriki?!

96
00:09:22,426 --> 00:09:23,427
What do you mean?

97
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:28,609
The ones that are controlling you
extracted the Shukaku from me.

98
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,486
That killed me once.

99
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,921
But thanks to Chiyo and my friends,
here I am, alive.

100
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:40,785
Granny Chiyo...She did that?!

101
00:09:41,282 --> 00:09:43,101
You have friends?!

102
00:09:45,634 --> 00:09:47,157
You thought he'd have no friends?

103
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:50,631
Man, he must've been
some lonely kid, huh?

104
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,426
At that age,
everyone has friends.

105
00:09:53,837 --> 00:09:57,048
Father, you tried to kill me
six times.

106
00:09:57,698 --> 00:10:00,409
And each time,
my fear and hatred of you grew.

107
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:04,562
But I no longer hate you.

108
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,190
I can understand why you did it.

109
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,892
I am the Kazekage now.

110
00:10:12,917 --> 00:10:16,337
It is a leader's duty to eliminate
threats against one's village.

111
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,075
We must protect it.

112
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:23,080
You are…the Kazekage?

113
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,041
That's not all.

114
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,585
He is also
the Commander-in-Chief of

115
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,004
the Allied Shinobi Forces'
Main Battle Regiment.

116
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:33,132
Despite his age,
he not only calls himself Kage,

117
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,968
he has the respect of
all the other Kage as well.

118
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,680
No wonder…

119
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:41,008
I thought it was odd
I sensed chakra types

120
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:42,907
from various villages mixed together.

121
00:10:43,678 --> 00:10:47,015
Imagine that, shinobi
forming an alliance.

122
00:10:47,746 --> 00:10:51,750
Not having eyebrows makes
a face more charismatic…

123
00:10:51,911 --> 00:10:54,705
Oh hey,
I don't have eyebrows either.

124
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:58,115
Then what about that wisp
of a moustache, Mizukage?

125
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,746
Guys, if you're going to kill us,
start with the mummy here!

126
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:06,165
I'll be more than happy
to root for you.

127
00:11:08,662 --> 00:11:10,706
He's your son, huh.

128
00:11:10,874 --> 00:11:12,459
He's a fine shinobi.

129
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,971
He's small…
So he was premature?

130
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,641
Are you sure he'll be all right?

131
00:11:24,068 --> 00:11:25,987
He's adapting.

132
00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:30,244
At last, with the third child,
we know he's compatible.

133
00:11:30,869 --> 00:11:33,872
This child must be brought up
with great care.

134
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:38,781
Please let me see…
my child's face.

135
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,741
Are you all right, Karura?!

136
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,455
He's…so tiny.

137
00:11:48,313 --> 00:11:50,982
Lady Karura's heart rate
is dropping.

138
00:11:51,463 --> 00:11:52,881
Do something! Quick!

139
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,071
This child is a failure as well.

140
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,116
The rampages have begun.

141
00:12:25,918 --> 00:12:28,588
If we can't maintain
our defenses further

142
00:12:28,613 --> 00:12:31,741
the Sand will be weakened
beyond repair.

143
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:35,440
We need to figure out how
we can negotiate with other lands,

144
00:12:35,465 --> 00:12:37,717
and we have to do something
about the Shukaku.

145
00:12:38,268 --> 00:12:40,812
As long as the Jinchuriki is unreliable,

146
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,605
we must rely on Lord Kazekage's
development of new jutsu,

147
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,675
and in our gold dust trade
for village stability.

148
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:49,977
As for Gaara…

149
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,606
Yashamaru, I need to speak
to you later.

150
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:54,857
Yes…

151
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:01,567
But Lord Gaara is still a child…

152
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:06,285
Over the years, I've had to judge
the value of many things.

153
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:09,163
And I must test his worth too.

154
00:13:11,439 --> 00:13:13,858
We will assess Gaara tomorrow.

155
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,963
After the village has been evacuated,
corner Gaara.

156
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:22,014
Tell him about his mother,
and provoke him emotionally.

157
00:13:22,784 --> 00:13:26,621
If he doesn't go berserk,
I won't kill him.

158
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,140
About my sister?!

159
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,851
Are you sure about this?

160
00:13:33,693 --> 00:13:37,697
I know that he loves and
respects Karura with all his heart.

161
00:13:39,472 --> 00:13:43,476
If that is taken away from him,
and if he can still suppress his rage…

162
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:45,866
then and only then,
will he suffice as a Jinchuriki!

163
00:13:56,544 --> 00:14:01,507
This Reanimation Jutsu may have
some merit, after all.

164
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:09,265
Let me see what
you may be worth!

165
00:14:10,033 --> 00:14:11,827
Can you defeat me?!

166
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,159
Everyone, go!

167
00:14:29,415 --> 00:14:30,249
Let's go!

168
00:14:30,274 --> 00:14:31,275
– Right!
– Right!

169
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:42,506
<i>Sand Hail!</i>

170
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,268
<i>Damn it!</i>

171
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,353
<i>Sand Hail is just a diversion.</i>

172
00:14:56,442 --> 00:14:58,986
<i>He used it to force me to
lift the Gold Dust!</i>

173
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:16,540
<i>Karura...You still live on
inside this child…</i>

174
00:15:17,319 --> 00:15:19,196
<i>That really is our old man…</i>

175
00:15:20,222 --> 00:15:22,265
You've grown, Gaara.

176
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:28,552
All a parent needs to do is
to believe in their children.

177
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:32,630
Just that little bit is
the most valuable treasure.

178
00:15:35,473 --> 00:15:37,391
Isn't that right, Karura?

179
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:43,984
It seems I didn't possess the ability
to see the true value of things…

180
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,528
What do you mean?

181
00:15:47,127 --> 00:15:50,172
No matter when or what,
the Sand will always protect you.

182
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,823
That's not the Shukaku's power.

183
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:56,372
But it's your mother's…Karura's.

184
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,439
<i>He's so tiny.</i>

185
00:16:05,003 --> 00:16:10,008
<i>No matter what happens,
I will always protect you, Gaara.</i>

186
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:14,203
Your mother loved you!

187
00:16:21,001 --> 00:16:24,922
Mother…loved me?

188
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:31,657
But that day when Yashamaru
came after me, he said…

189
00:16:32,182 --> 00:16:35,811
<i>You were never…loved.</i>

190
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:41,417
I ordered Yashamaru to lie to you.

191
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,377
In order to provoke you,

192
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:46,130
and to test the volatility of
the Tailed Beast inside you…

193
00:16:46,767 --> 00:16:48,311
For the sake of the village.

194
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,977
If there was anyone
Yashamaru hated…

195
00:16:52,992 --> 00:16:54,497
it would be me, not you.

196
00:16:55,341 --> 00:16:58,617
I'm the one who sealed
the Shukaku of the Sand

197
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:01,687
into his pregnant older sister.

198
00:17:03,228 --> 00:17:05,397
But Yashamaru was also a shinobi.

199
00:17:05,656 --> 00:17:09,595
He was my right-hand man and
a member of the Sand Black Ops.

200
00:17:09,993 --> 00:17:12,900
So he did as he was ordered,
for the sake of the village.

201
00:17:15,487 --> 00:17:16,551
I failed.

202
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,914
It seems I failed
in everything I did.

203
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:25,029
I burdened you unnecessarily,

204
00:17:25,156 --> 00:17:29,703
and arbitrarily decided that
you weren't worth anything.

205
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,771
I took away your future
by turning you into the Jinchuriki

206
00:17:34,612 --> 00:17:36,447
and I took your mother away
from you.

207
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,682
I robbed you of your love
for your mother.

208
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,351
I took away the bonds you had
with people.

209
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,604
And I even tried to take your life.

210
00:17:44,344 --> 00:17:47,180
As a parent…

211
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,401
there is only one thing
that I gave you.

212
00:17:50,121 --> 00:17:52,958
I gave you a broken heart.

213
00:17:55,442 --> 00:18:00,447
Physical wounds will definitely bleed
and may look painful.

214
00:18:01,078 --> 00:18:04,665
But over time,
they heal by themselves.

215
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:07,236
And if you apply medicine,
they will heal faster.

216
00:18:08,438 --> 00:18:11,149
What's troublesome are
wounds of the heart.

217
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,592
Nothing is harder to heal.

218
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,803
Wounds of the heart?

219
00:18:16,433 --> 00:18:19,728
They're a bit different
from physical injuries.

220
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:23,393
You can't apply medicine,
for one thing.

221
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,355
And sometimes, they never heal.

222
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:31,276
There's only one cure for
a wound of the heart.

223
00:18:32,597 --> 00:18:35,391
It's a bit bothersome and

224
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,117
you can only receive it
from someone else.

225
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:40,869
What is it?

226
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,749
It's love.

227
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,210
– Love?
– Yes.

228
00:18:49,242 --> 00:18:50,952
How do I get it?

229
00:18:51,518 --> 00:18:54,562
You've already received it,
Lord Gaara.

230
00:18:56,757 --> 00:19:02,049
I believe your mother's will
has seeped into the Sand.

231
00:19:06,848 --> 00:19:12,687
<i>My sister…even in death…
wanted to protect you, Lord Gaara.</i>

232
00:19:28,511 --> 00:19:29,637
<i>Karura…</i>

233
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,337
Mothers are powerful.

234
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:36,224
She's dead, but she believed
in you and still protects you.

235
00:19:37,466 --> 00:19:39,593
She's the one who has
brought you this far.

236
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:43,742
She gave you life, so that
you would become the Kazekage.

237
00:19:43,908 --> 00:19:45,367
She gave you friends.

238
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:48,312
She gave you the bonds with
your siblings and community.

239
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:50,981
All things that I took away from you.

240
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:56,403
All I did as your father was
to torment you.

241
00:19:56,445 --> 00:20:00,490
I don't deserve to be called
your father.

242
00:20:03,408 --> 00:20:05,952
My mother was wonderful indeed.

243
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:12,628
Thanks to her, for the first time,
I received medicine from my father.

244
00:20:13,703 --> 00:20:16,372
Gaara...You…

245
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,588
<i>You surpassed me long ago.</i>

246
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:30,002
<i>I leave the village to you, Gaara!</i>

247
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,492
So they'll use these tags to seal us.

248
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,453
All right!
Well done, young Kazekage!

249
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:48,705
What?

250
00:20:51,014 --> 00:20:52,458
What's going on?!

251
00:20:52,699 --> 00:20:55,743
I'm totally ready to be sealed!

252
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:03,029
Our bodies are programmed to
automatically counter an enemy's jutsu!

253
00:21:09,404 --> 00:21:10,405
Here they come!

254
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:19,945
Surround those two!

255
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:22,906
<i>Particle Style:</i>

256
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,764
<i>Atomic Dismantling Jutsu!</i>

257
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,545
You've aged, Ohnoki.

258
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,922
Nonsense…

259
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,228
<i>You'd better get the Kazekage here
to use his sensory skills</i>

260
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,980
<i>or you'll die, Ohnoki!</i>

261
00:22:01,483 --> 00:22:02,415
Hey!

262
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:06,867
Don't underestimate my jutsu!
You really should stand back!

263
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:07,991
For real!

264
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:08,931
For real?

265
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,080
Here are my weaknesses!

266
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:13,740
For real!

267
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:14,927
For real?

268
00:22:15,212 --> 00:22:15,993
For real.

269
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:21,673
Now listen! I'm a Shadow Style user,
in other words, I use genjutsu.

270
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,351
And my summoning is…

271
00:22:26,209 --> 00:22:27,453
a Giant Clam!

272
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:33,101
I'm a Lightning User!

273
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:36,621
Line up your Earth Style shinobi
and use them as a shield…

274
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,690
and attack with
your Wind Style shinobi!

275
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,028
Thanks for your thoughtfulness!
In fact, I'd like to know more!

276
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:45,447
I have no control over my body!

277
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,574
I can't waste any more time talking!

278
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:48,867
Come!

279
00:22:50,496 --> 00:22:52,999
Wind and Earth Style shinobi,
follow me!

280
00:22:53,187 --> 00:22:54,517
Sealing Unit, keep up with us!

281
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:59,378
<i>That's right. Go away, Raikage.</i>

282
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:04,479
<i>If you and I stick together,
these guys won't be able to seal us.</i>

283
00:23:05,942 --> 00:23:08,223
So, do you have a strategy…

284
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,972
Fifth Kazekage?

285
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,853
I'm leaving you guys in charge here.

286
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,747
Huh?! Commander!

287
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:19,489
We have to deal with him
without you?!

288
00:23:19,962 --> 00:23:22,882
Hey, hey! What kind of tactic is that?!

289
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,860
Didn't you hear me?!
I am a Shadow User!

290
00:23:27,247 --> 00:23:30,417
This Giant Clam can cast
a genjutsu over a wide area!

291
00:23:31,383 --> 00:23:33,148
It'll make you see illusions!

292
00:23:33,173 --> 00:23:34,924
A physical attack won't work!

293
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,526
I'm talking about a mirage!

294
00:23:37,647 --> 00:23:40,150
I can tell.
You have no desire to kill.

295
00:23:40,334 --> 00:23:42,304
Of course not!
That's to be expected!

296
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:47,300
I can't stand being manipulated
by some other jutsu user.

297
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:52,597
That's why I want you to
seal me quickly, Kazekage! Hey!

298
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:53,640
Deal with him.

299
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:54,599
Hey!

300
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,741
You can count on us!

301
00:23:55,766 --> 00:23:57,017
Hey, wispy whiskers!

302
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:58,520
<i>Wispy whiskers?</i>

303
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:01,668
Don't call me that!

304
00:24:01,981 --> 00:24:04,526
I don't care about
the Reanimation anymore. I'll kill you!

305
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,697
He means it!

306
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,705
Man, this is awkward.

307
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,498
Let's go, guys!

308
00:24:18,705 --> 00:24:20,332
– Yeah!
– Right!

309
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,501
Let's do it!

310
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,345
– Yeah!
– Right!

311
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:26,039
I'm counting on you…
Do something.

312
00:24:36,331 --> 00:24:39,167
Good! Now you look like you
mean business!

313
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,319
Listen up, I'll tell you one more time!

314
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:46,485
Attacking this me is useless!

315
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,784
<i>Your sensory skills are useless
against me.</i>

316
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,162
You shouldn't underestimate me.

317
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:00,123
<i>Stone Clone Jutsu!</i>

318
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:05,086
<i>So you'll come at me in numbers…
That might work.</i>

319
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:13,970
Did we get him?

320
00:25:16,501 --> 00:25:17,502
No way!

321
00:25:18,747 --> 00:25:23,502
I told you attacking
this me is useless!

322
00:25:23,704 --> 00:25:25,665
This me is just a mirage!

323
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,859
Then what do we have to do?!

324
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:32,531
So, defeat my Giant Clam first!

325
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:36,868
It's the one creating the mirage.

326
00:25:37,331 --> 00:25:38,833
But its shell is hard.

327
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:41,623
Use large-scale weapons
or paper bombs!

328
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,109
But…

329
00:25:43,134 --> 00:25:44,135
What?

330
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,962
We just used them
with the last attack…

331
00:25:59,543 --> 00:26:02,421
Just hurry up and
retrieve the weapons!

332
00:26:03,406 --> 00:26:04,449
I'm sorry!

333
00:26:04,684 --> 00:26:06,061
Everyone, quickly!

334
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:09,150
Hurry!

335
00:26:09,885 --> 00:26:11,261
Hey, that's mine.

336
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,990
Where's my weapon?

337
00:26:15,572 --> 00:26:18,074
Hey! There are a lot of 'em
over that way too!

338
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,414
What are you doing here?
Digging for clams?

339
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,499
Pardon us.

340
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,127
This is awkward…

341
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,505
All right! Let's do it, everyone!

342
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,090
– Right!
– Right!

343
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,550
Target the Giant Clam!

344
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,801
Take that!

345
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:44,644
Did we get it?

346
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:50,820
Huh?

347
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,487
That Giant Clam is also a mirage, idiots!

348
00:26:54,903 --> 00:26:56,738
Aim for the real one!

349
00:26:57,084 --> 00:27:00,128
Yeah, so tell us where the real one is!

350
00:27:00,153 --> 00:27:03,740
Like I said! Look around behind me!

351
00:27:03,765 --> 00:27:06,351
It's camouflaged within
a mirage and hiding!

352
00:27:06,822 --> 00:27:08,073
Aww, damn it!

353
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:14,924
I told you attacking
this me is useless!

354
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,693
Oh no, I was aiming for
the Giant Clam in the back.

355
00:27:18,992 --> 00:27:22,168
Like I said, that's a mirage, idiot!

356
00:27:22,193 --> 00:27:24,034
Aw man, I don't understand!

357
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,769
I don't get it!

358
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,438
– We don't get it!
– We don't get it!

359
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,106
Look, you guys…

360
00:27:30,487 --> 00:27:31,488
Wispy whiskers!

361
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:33,411
I'll kill you!

362
00:27:34,344 --> 00:27:35,470
He means it!

363
00:27:36,531 --> 00:27:39,242
– Who said that?! Apologize!
– Come out and apologize! Hurry!

364
00:27:39,267 --> 00:27:40,310
I'm sorry.

365
00:27:42,291 --> 00:27:43,417
This is awkward…

366
00:27:48,093 --> 00:27:49,303
Where did that come from?!

367
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:56,466
Behind you, Tsuchikage!

368
00:27:59,587 --> 00:28:01,631
<i>Not now!</i>

369
00:28:05,428 --> 00:28:06,512
<i>Particle Style:</i>

370
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,520
<i>Atomic Dismantling Jutsu.</i>

371
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,603
<i>Is that…?!</i>

372
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,872
<i>Planet Rasengan!</i>

373
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:23,827
Damn it!

374
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:26,037
Lord Mu is a Sensory shinobi.

375
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,080
Gaara!

376
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:27,879
Sand!

377
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:35,756
Dodge this.
My jutsu is faster than yours!

378
00:28:39,546 --> 00:28:40,264
All right!

379
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,304
This is…

380
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,975
a violently rotating…

381
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,560
Rasengan!

382
00:28:57,236 --> 00:29:00,114
<i>Earth Style: Boulder Jutsu!</i>

383
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,248
Now you're so heavy,

384
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,958
you won't even be able to
raise your arms.

385
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:16,587
Owww…

386
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:21,701
You used to hate the other villages,
now you work so well with them.

387
00:29:23,508 --> 00:29:25,969
It's worth living a long life.

388
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:28,266
You get to enjoy change.

389
00:29:35,188 --> 00:29:38,107
Don't let down your guard. I'm still…

390
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:43,156
All right! Way to go, Gaara!

391
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:47,452
Oh yeah…
Nice work too, Shorty Gramps!

392
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:50,413
I am the Tsuchikage, you know.

393
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,123
By the way—

394
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,918
What are you doing
on the battlefield?!

395
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:56,669
Why did you come?!

396
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,880
Err…

397
00:29:58,947 --> 00:30:00,281
Well…

398
00:30:00,746 --> 00:30:02,623
Let me explain…

399
00:30:02,705 --> 00:30:06,542
You better have a good enough
explanation to persuade me!

400
00:30:07,663 --> 00:30:08,984
<i>That would be impossible.</i>

401
00:30:10,526 --> 00:30:12,278
<i>So I will do the talking.</i>

402
00:30:12,407 --> 00:30:14,283
<i>This is Shikaku Nara at HQ.</i>

403
00:30:14,674 --> 00:30:17,886
<i>Both you and the Tsuchikage
were in the middle of fighting,</i>

404
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:20,819
<i>so I thought I'd save
the complicated talk for later.</i>

405
00:30:21,408 --> 00:30:25,006
Let's hear it then.
But the fighting is not over.

406
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,699
We must head out immediately.

407
00:30:27,351 --> 00:30:29,422
You can brief us on the way.

408
00:30:33,738 --> 00:30:38,242
You know,
I'm not trying to win here.

409
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,715
You're too strong for us.

410
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:48,513
Yeah well…
Still, you must seal me.

411
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,682
Otherwise, I'll remain a puppet…

412
00:30:51,499 --> 00:30:53,042
Okay, everyone, get up! Get up!

413
00:30:56,356 --> 00:30:57,857
So that's how it is, eh?

414
00:30:58,072 --> 00:31:00,616
I can't believe even
the Raikage relented.

415
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,694
All right, I understand.

416
00:31:03,065 --> 00:31:04,984
<i>I'm going to cease transmitting now.</i>

417
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:08,324
Naruto.

418
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:12,161
I have nothing against going
from one battlefield to another

419
00:31:12,186 --> 00:31:14,105
to identify the enemy
using transformation.

420
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:16,666
But as a former Jinchuriki,
I know…

421
00:31:17,286 --> 00:31:19,121
The Nine-Tails' chakra…

422
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:22,839
Are you sure you can handle
using it so frequently?

423
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:31,180
I don't plan on dying
until I become the Hokage.

424
00:31:32,288 --> 00:31:36,793
Don't treat me like a kid just
because you're the Kazekage now.

425
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,733
I'll take the right battlefront!

426
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,986
Gaara and Gramps Tsuchikage,
take the left!

427
00:31:45,366 --> 00:31:48,703
Naruto, the Third Raikage is there!

428
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:49,949
Got it!

429
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,953
And our opponent is
the Second Mizukage, correct?

430
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:55,747
The genjutsu user…

431
00:31:56,322 --> 00:31:59,950
Yes...Ordinary methods
won't work against him.

432
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,457
Who are you aiming at?

433
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:12,221
You're too fast for our attacks!

434
00:32:14,665 --> 00:32:16,041
I'll say it again.

435
00:32:16,243 --> 00:32:18,328
I am a Lightning Style User.

436
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,480
When I arm myself with
the Lightning Style,

437
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,692
my speed and defensive power exceed
the normal limits of my body.

438
00:32:25,258 --> 00:32:27,572
Unless you attack with
the Wind Style,

439
00:32:27,692 --> 00:32:29,610
you will never be able
to take me down.

440
00:32:30,244 --> 00:32:32,871
The trouble is,
we can't land a blow even with that!

441
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,161
No, wait…

442
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:38,494
Wind Style Unit!
Attack Formation C!

443
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:39,290
Right!

444
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,208
Here we go!

445
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,877
Humph! Instead of doing it quietly,

446
00:32:42,902 --> 00:32:45,029
she announces how
they're going to attack.

447
00:32:45,394 --> 00:32:47,062
Group Wind Style Jutsu!

448
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,177
<i>Wind Style: Casting Net!</i>

449
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:58,309
A wide-range jutsu
to overtake my speed…

450
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,898
Splendid!

451
00:33:05,891 --> 00:33:08,143
All right! We'll surround him
all at once!

452
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,752
No matter how many times
we attack, there's no effect!

453
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,879
We haven't inflicted any damage!

454
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:43,062
<i>Our only choice is to batter him
with consecutive top-speed Blade Dance!</i>

455
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,524
Is that you, Dodai?

456
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,317
Yes.

457
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,731
The Third Lord Raikage was a shinobi

458
00:33:50,756 --> 00:33:52,591
blessed not only with
strength and speed,

459
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,908
but also with extraordinary
physical resilience.

460
00:33:56,617 --> 00:34:00,656
Even long-distance Wind Style attacks,
which should reach him,

461
00:34:00,681 --> 00:34:02,224
do not affect him.

462
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:04,594
We need an even more
powerful Wind Style user.

463
00:34:05,713 --> 00:34:07,966
I'm a pretty good
Wind Style user myself.

464
00:34:09,809 --> 00:34:12,165
So how did he actually die?

465
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,680
In order to save his comrades…

466
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:22,060
He used himself as a decoy
and faced 10,000 enemy troops alone.

467
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:25,340
It's said he stood for three days
and three nights

468
00:34:25,365 --> 00:34:27,659
in order to buy enough time to
let his comrades escape.

469
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:36,616
I need this one to
buy me some time…

470
00:34:36,795 --> 00:34:39,256
while I finish summoning <i>him</i>.

471
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,097
Guess I'll just have to take over.

472
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:45,750
Honestly, among the Allied Forces,

473
00:34:45,915 --> 00:34:47,662
there isn't a stronger
Wind Style user than me.

474
00:34:47,687 --> 00:34:48,346
There is!

475
00:34:55,695 --> 00:34:56,570
It's me!

476
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:04,685
<i>What?! Is that Naruto?!
What is he doing here?</i>

477
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,280
No! That's not good enough!

478
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,632
Not with his Cloak of Lightning…

479
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:21,744
I know! Raikage are
always super fast!

480
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:31,212
<i>Okay! When it comes back…</i>

481
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:34,590
<i>At this distance…</i>

482
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,176
It's gonna hit!

483
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,565
<i>That Wind Style is strong!</i>

484
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:52,400
<i>This will work…</i>

485
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,027
Now, Sealing Corps! Hurry!

486
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,320
Right!

487
00:35:59,856 --> 00:36:00,575
All right!

488
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,455
W-What?!

489
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,709
Third Raikage…

490
00:36:09,912 --> 00:36:12,246
You are so strong,
it's frightening…

491
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:18,163
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

492
00:36:18,435 --> 00:36:20,396
<i>Rasen Shuriken didn't work?!</i>

493
00:36:23,776 --> 00:36:26,528
The look in Lord Raikage's eyes
has changed…

494
00:36:27,174 --> 00:36:29,218
He's been completely taken over.

495
00:36:34,417 --> 00:36:35,276
That's…?!

496
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,112
Everyone, get away from
the Third Raikage!

497
00:36:38,332 --> 00:36:41,419
Earth Style shinobi,
form a wall immediately!

498
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,576
Everyone, link up!

499
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:44,619
– Right!
– Right!

500
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,261
– <i>Earth Style: Great Mud Wall!</i>
– <i>Earth Style: Great Mud Wall!</i>

501
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,260
Disperse!

502
00:37:02,957 --> 00:37:04,138
Come with me, Naruto!

503
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:15,566
<i>Lava Style: Rubber Wall!</i>

504
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:19,362
What the—?!

505
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,489
That was the Third Raikage's
most lethal ninjutsu…

506
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,366
The Piercing Four-Fingered
Thrust of Hell!

507
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:27,245
He accumulates Lightning chakra
in his fingertip and strikes…

508
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:30,206
This thrust technique complements
the Lightning Style.

509
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:34,460
<i>Just like Kakashi Sensei's Lightning Blade
and Sasuke's Chidori.</i>

510
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:42,510
Everyone, get as far away
as possible, now!

511
00:37:43,249 --> 00:37:47,587
No! If we know where he'll appear,
we should aim for that spot all together!

512
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:49,308
Everyone, stand by!

513
00:37:50,054 --> 00:37:54,350
It's payback time for all
the times we missed!

514
00:37:54,506 --> 00:37:57,325
Stop! Listen to the Cloud shinobi!

515
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,237
Get him!

516
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,784
Damn it!

517
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,038
Fools!

518
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:24,415
He's switched to
the Three-Fingered Assault!

519
00:38:24,828 --> 00:38:27,080
What kind of jutsu is it anyway?

520
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,681
It's way too powerful!

521
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,934
He took dozens down in
an instant, all by himself!

522
00:38:32,567 --> 00:38:35,621
The fewer the fingers he uses,
the more focused the energy and

523
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,773
the more powerful the Thrusts of Hell!

524
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,192
It's the Third's Invincible Spear!

525
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:43,904
And he can handle it with
his impermeable body.

526
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:45,614
It's his ultimate shield!

527
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:48,751
Is that old man even human…?

528
00:38:49,407 --> 00:38:51,618
They say he is the only shinobi
to have ever been able

529
00:38:52,031 --> 00:38:54,457
to go head to head with a Tailed Beast,
unarmored and unarmed!

530
00:38:55,013 --> 00:38:57,500
<i>Raikage are amazing!</i>

531
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:01,940
Huh?

532
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:04,592
What's the matter?

533
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:07,428
So what's up with that?

534
00:39:07,902 --> 00:39:08,596
With what?

535
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:11,599
Look at that…
The scar on his chest!

536
00:39:12,324 --> 00:39:16,370
If his body's the ultimate shield,
how'd he get that?

537
00:39:18,445 --> 00:39:19,273
Oh, that…

538
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:23,694
Once, the Third Raikage helped everyone
get away from the Eight-Tails

539
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:26,447
by stopping its rampage
all by himself.

540
00:39:27,492 --> 00:39:29,492
Then the Eight-Tails hurt him?

541
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:33,913
He called that the most
shameful incident of his life.

542
00:39:33,966 --> 00:39:37,261
One that he never spoke about…

543
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,544
Not even the Fourth Raikage knows.

544
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:45,883
Okay, I get that ordinary attacks
won't hurt him.

545
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:49,261
But if he got hurt fighting
the Eight-Tails,

546
00:39:49,523 --> 00:39:52,026
then the Eight-Tails' strongest jutsu is…

547
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,373
<i>Tailed Beast Bomb!</i>

548
00:39:59,071 --> 00:40:01,982
<i>Th-This is the Tailed Beast Bomb…
The same as the Eight-Tails'!</i>

549
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:05,069
<i>He's holding a mass of chakra
this heavy in his human form?!</i>

550
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,488
<i>Is this even possible?</i>

551
00:40:14,298 --> 00:40:17,426
<i>I figured it was impossible.</i>

552
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,362
What?! What happened?!

553
00:40:20,782 --> 00:40:22,034
Damn it!

554
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:23,696
It still didn't work!

555
00:40:24,193 --> 00:40:26,153
<i>His cloak of chakra is gone.</i>

556
00:40:26,429 --> 00:40:27,680
<i>He overdid it…</i>

557
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:29,317
Lady Temari!

558
00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:32,481
The enemy has broken through
our ranks! Many are hurt!

559
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:35,057
Everyone, hurry and gather the wounded!

560
00:40:35,172 --> 00:40:36,423
Notify the medical team!

561
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:40,454
Tell all to maintain
a standby position at a distance—!

562
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:46,610
Are you all right?!

563
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:47,778
Hey, hang on!

564
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,269
Hey, Bendy Guy!

565
00:40:49,328 --> 00:40:51,664
I need to get a hold of Octopops
and Eight-Tails right away!

566
00:40:51,972 --> 00:40:54,183
How do I reach them?!

567
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,561
You're in luck.

568
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:56,337
Huh?!

569
00:40:56,466 --> 00:40:58,427
I'm with the Com Corps.

570
00:41:09,106 --> 00:41:10,816
<i>He's withdrawn
his Three-Fingered Assault!</i>

571
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:13,387
<i>He's aiming for a KO with a punch.</i>

572
00:41:17,566 --> 00:41:19,110
<i>Lava Style: Rubber Sphere!</i>

573
00:41:25,534 --> 00:41:28,161
<i>Lord Dodai of the Hidden Cloud!
What do you need?</i>

574
00:41:28,404 --> 00:41:31,282
<i>Naruto needs to speak to
Bee and Eight-Tails.</i>

575
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,880
<i>Please contact them immediately!</i>

576
00:41:34,323 --> 00:41:37,743
<i>While the Third Raikage is still chasing
after the dummy Rubber Ball!</i>

577
00:41:39,898 --> 00:41:42,485
<i>He made it look like
he had me inside that ball,</i>

578
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:45,221
<i>but he pulled me out and
hid me behind a boulder!</i>

579
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:48,172
<i>Bendy Guy thinks fast!</i>

580
00:41:49,279 --> 00:41:50,655
Thanks, Bendy Guy!

581
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:53,677
Now I'll have time to talk
to Octopops!

582
00:41:59,431 --> 00:42:02,101
He'll probably catch on right away!

583
00:42:02,126 --> 00:42:04,420
Remember, you don't have much time!

584
00:42:04,752 --> 00:42:05,316
Yeah!

585
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:13,030
<i>Naruto, you want to talk
to Bee and Eight-Tails,</i>

586
00:42:13,225 --> 00:42:14,464
<i>but aren't they nearby?</i>

587
00:42:14,946 --> 00:42:16,823
<i>You're supposed to
be working together.</i>

588
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:19,620
<i>They're not here now. Besides…</i>

589
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:23,666
<i>Never mind, hurry and
contact them please!</i>

590
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:25,376
<i>There's no time!</i>

591
00:42:33,974 --> 00:42:36,060
<i>Naruto's gone on ahead!</i>

592
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,222
<i>Hurry up and finish your business!</i>

593
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,807
<i>How long is it going to take?!</i>

594
00:42:40,198 --> 00:42:43,034
The urge to go pee is
beyond one's control…y'see?

595
00:42:45,675 --> 00:42:47,802
<i>Octopops, it's me, Naruto!</i>

596
00:42:48,046 --> 00:42:50,882
<i>I have to ask Eight-Tails something!</i>

597
00:42:51,183 --> 00:42:52,727
<i>Put him on!</i>

598
00:42:53,288 --> 00:42:58,008
Relieving oneself takes concentration.
So let me focus on urination.

599
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,244
I can't talk now…

600
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:03,289
<i>I'm here, Naruto! What's going on?</i>

601
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:05,082
<i>You seem to be in a panic!</i>

602
00:43:05,145 --> 00:43:06,271
<i>Hey, Eight-Tails…</i>

603
00:43:06,307 --> 00:43:09,102
<i>You've fought the Third Raikage
before, right?</i>

604
00:43:09,916 --> 00:43:12,168
<i>Yeah, long ago.</i>

605
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:15,259
<i>He was solid and
could take the blows.</i>

606
00:43:15,868 --> 00:43:18,954
<i>Once, he used this move called
the One-Fingered Assault</i>

607
00:43:18,979 --> 00:43:21,106
<i>and cut off all my tails.</i>

608
00:43:22,012 --> 00:43:25,682
<i>How did you manage to scar
Gramps Raikage on the chest?</i>

609
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:27,273
<i>Huh?!</i>

610
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:30,274
<i>Maybe it was my Tailed Beast Bomb?</i>

611
00:43:30,299 --> 00:43:31,884
<i>No, maybe it wasn't…</i>

612
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:35,237
<i>We were pushing against
each other with all our might,</i>

613
00:43:35,262 --> 00:43:37,389
<i>and we both fell forward.</i>

614
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,575
<i>I don't quite remember.</i>

615
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:54,882
<i>Maybe…</i>

616
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,847
<i>Hey thanks, Eight-Tails!</i>

617
00:44:01,981 --> 00:44:03,566
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

618
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:07,478
<i>What? Is this different
from the one earlier?!</i>

619
00:44:07,992 --> 00:44:10,453
Gramps Raikage is headed this way.

620
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,983
When he gets here,
get out of the way, Bendy Guy!

621
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,526
There's something I want to try.

622
00:44:18,336 --> 00:44:19,281
Got it.

623
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,494
<i>Rasengan!</i>

624
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:28,791
Everyone! Do not assist!

625
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,668
Sealing Corps! Stand by!

626
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:31,353
Right!

627
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,181
<i>I don't know what he's planning,</i>

628
00:44:34,206 --> 00:44:36,125
<i>but that's just a Rasengan!</i>

629
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:37,616
Is that going to be enough?

630
00:44:43,159 --> 00:44:47,288
<i>His Invincible Spear will cut
through Naruto's arms and legs.</i>

631
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,342
<i>I'll have him brought back
to me half-dead.</i>

632
00:44:52,134 --> 00:44:54,345
<i>Sage Mode: Frog Kumite!</i>

633
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:57,169
<i>With this, I can sense danger
over a wider range, and it's faster!</i>

634
00:44:57,277 --> 00:45:00,072
<i>So I'll be able to counter
at the last minute…</i>

635
00:45:05,864 --> 00:45:08,325
<i>And aim straight for his arm!</i>

636
00:45:29,376 --> 00:45:31,170
Just like I thought!

637
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:36,787
<i>I see...That's how he got
that scar on his chest!</i>

638
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:48,704
– We did it!
– We did it!

639
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:51,749
All right! Way to go, Naruto!

640
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:52,875
Yes!

641
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,210
That was sharp of you!

642
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:59,423
Eight-Tails told me that they were
pushing as hard as they could,

643
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,842
then fell forward.

644
00:46:02,716 --> 00:46:07,179
I figured that he must've fallen
on his own hand.

645
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:10,517
He injured himself.
That's why it was so embarrassing.

646
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:16,121
He was the shinobi with
the ultimate spear and shield…

647
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,859
What a paradox.

648
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:22,821
Lord Third's spear was stronger,
it seems…

649
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:23,722
Yeah!

650
00:46:28,512 --> 00:46:32,808
Probably the shinobi with
the greatest shield is Gaara!

651
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:40,255
– Oh, man…
– Still?

652
00:46:41,198 --> 00:46:43,784
I keep telling you it's a mirage.

653
00:46:44,972 --> 00:46:45,932
Go retrieve them!

654
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:48,241
I've had it.

655
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,224
Hey, you there!

656
00:46:51,125 --> 00:46:52,918
Huh? You mean me?

657
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,854
You're from the Hidden Mist,
aren't you?

658
00:46:56,186 --> 00:46:58,105
Aren't you familiar with my jutsu?

659
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,776
I know little about you,
Lord Second.

660
00:47:00,801 --> 00:47:04,221
I mean, I only know about
the current Lord Fifth.

661
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:08,659
The secretiveness of
the Hidden Mist is to blame for this.

662
00:47:09,741 --> 00:47:11,201
If I knew things would be like this,

663
00:47:11,226 --> 00:47:13,853
I would've left behind
a bigger legend!

664
00:47:19,341 --> 00:47:20,342
Not good…

665
00:47:21,155 --> 00:47:22,323
Hey, you there!

666
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:26,009
Playtime is over!
Come at me seriously now!

667
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:28,387
We have been serious!

668
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:32,688
I have no control over my body.
It's casting jutsu on its own.

669
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:36,436
Damn it! I can't stand this!

670
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,939
It's my Water Balloon Jutsu.

671
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:40,566
Defend yourselves!

672
00:47:58,136 --> 00:47:59,429
Commander Gaara!

673
00:48:00,279 --> 00:48:02,823
Huh? What took you so long?!

674
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:07,759
I hope this time you'll seal me!

675
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,720
I intend to.

676
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,513
I'm looking forward to it.

677
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:19,471
Commander!

678
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:34,587
This is not the time to be
looking somewhere else!

679
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,581
Hey…

680
00:48:45,801 --> 00:48:47,177
Is that all you got?

681
00:48:53,066 --> 00:48:56,681
I keep telling you my weaknesses,
yet every single one of you…

682
00:48:57,594 --> 00:49:00,930
You tell us, but you're still too strong!

683
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:09,745
<i>This is closer to oil than water.</i>

684
00:49:10,879 --> 00:49:12,925
<i>Even if I use Sand as a barrier,</i>

685
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,952
<i>it'll just seep in and
make it collapse.</i>

686
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:19,122
You went to tackle Mu first,
didn't you?

687
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:25,295
You always want to go for
the stronger one first.

688
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,630
That's what you call battle!

689
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,006
And that's what we did.

690
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:32,719
Isn't it obvious I'm the stronger one?!

691
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:37,544
That guy looks like
a half-dead mummy. Am I right?

692
00:49:38,246 --> 00:49:40,914
I realize now
that appearances can deceive.

693
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:44,356
You certainly are strong.

694
00:49:46,343 --> 00:49:48,011
Finally, you understand.

695
00:49:49,421 --> 00:49:53,008
Huh?! What do you mean
"appearances can be deceiving"?!

696
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:54,741
But you've got wispy whis—

697
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:55,534
Cut it out!

698
00:49:57,619 --> 00:50:02,080
I told you…
that this me is a mirage,

699
00:50:02,105 --> 00:50:04,691
created by the Giant Clam's
wide-range genjutsu.

700
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:08,005
So physical attacks are useless!

701
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:11,262
Find the Giant Clam quickly
and destroy it!

702
00:50:11,287 --> 00:50:12,705
Otherwise, this will never end…

703
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:16,596
That's right. Your Sand…

704
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:28,817
So you were already searching
for it with your Sand.

705
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:32,320
I wondered why you were just focused
on the defensive.

706
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:36,742
Well, finally a worthy foe!

707
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,454
Now hurry up and defeat me!

708
00:50:41,235 --> 00:50:43,821
<i>Earth Style: Stone Fist jutsu!</i>

709
00:50:49,323 --> 00:50:50,991
You're not using
the Particle Style…

710
00:50:51,016 --> 00:50:52,392
Have you run out of juice?

711
00:50:54,208 --> 00:50:58,545
I'm not that Lil' Ohnoki
you used to make fun of long ago!

712
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,401
<i>Earth Style:</i>

713
00:51:01,426 --> 00:51:03,136
<i>Super Weighted Boulder Jutsu!</i>

714
00:51:05,538 --> 00:51:07,791
Not bad, Ohnoki!

715
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:15,322
<i>Uh-oh...I've done it now!</i>

716
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:18,896
The genjutsu is undone.

717
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:25,123
Oh, my back!

718
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:31,129
I always knew
you'd be Tsuchikage.

719
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:40,514
But you're nothing more than
a geezer with a sore back right now!

720
00:51:41,311 --> 00:51:43,939
I'll admit that was a punch
with some power to it,

721
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,478
but you overdid it and
strained your back!

722
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,523
Anyway! Hurry up and run!

723
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:52,275
I'm about to use
the Hozuki Clan's Water Gun Jutsu!

724
00:51:54,574 --> 00:51:56,185
I can't stop myself!

725
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:05,622
What did I tell you, idiot?!

726
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,791
It's because you're way
too old for this!

727
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:16,633
Oww…

728
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:18,593
Thanks, Kazekage!

729
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:24,599
An Eye of Sand…

730
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,979
So he used that to keep
an eye on Ohnoki all this time!

731
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:33,776
<i>When he got the Giant Clam,</i>

732
00:52:33,801 --> 00:52:35,720
<i>he switched out with
a Sand Clone, eh?</i>

733
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,198
This one's gonna be big…

734
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:44,578
And he doesn't have eyebrows.

735
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:49,457
Okay! We got him!

736
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:51,209
No, it didn't work!

737
00:52:51,516 --> 00:52:54,352
The slime is making the Sand
not stick together!

738
00:53:01,477 --> 00:53:04,931
<i>This is bad!
I'm starting to enjoy this fight!</i>

739
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:11,146
<i>Grand Sand Mausoleum!</i>

740
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:15,734
Now! Throw every Sealing Tag
you've got!

741
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:20,572
There's no way his slime can
keep up with this much Sand.

742
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:22,665
Attach the Sealing Chains!

743
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,617
Good! We have this one!

744
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:38,590
Wha—?!

745
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:44,512
<i>Th-This can't be…!</i>

746
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:53,230
What the hell is that?!

747
00:53:53,255 --> 00:53:54,840
Is it another genjutsu?

748
00:53:55,655 --> 00:53:56,740
Is it a genjutsu?

749
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,069
No...It's not a genjutsu!

750
00:54:00,198 --> 00:54:02,784
That gave my predecessor
Lord Mu some trouble!

751
00:54:02,809 --> 00:54:05,103
It's the Infinite Explosion Ninjutsu
of the Mizukage!

752
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:07,577
The Steam Imp!

753
00:54:14,407 --> 00:54:15,502
Hail?

754
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:18,755
Air forced upwards by
the steam explosion gets cooled

755
00:54:19,008 --> 00:54:21,716
in the upper atmosphere
and turns into hail!

756
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:35,188
What's this?

757
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,149
He's a clone made from
oil and water

758
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:40,277
taken from inside
the Mizukage's body.

759
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:44,114
The exterior surface of
its child-like form is composed of oil,

760
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:46,032
while its interior is just water.

761
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:49,327
Its special feature is that it can
both heat up and cool down easily.

762
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:51,371
When it moves around,

763
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:54,416
the oil on its surface
heats up precipitously,

764
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:57,127
causing rapid vaporization
of the water inside,

765
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,337
resulting in an explosion of steam!

766
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:02,800
And when the hail cools it,

767
00:55:02,825 --> 00:55:06,169
it shrinks back down to its original size
and it is ready to explode again.

768
00:55:10,517 --> 00:55:11,328
It's coming!

769
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:17,105
<i>He's faster than I expected!</i>

770
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:23,135
Are you all right?!

771
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,287
Damn it! This clone's a wily one!

772
00:55:26,634 --> 00:55:28,594
The real one should be
around here somewhere!

773
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:31,661
Don't bother with the clone.
Look for the original!

774
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:33,705
Another feature of
this jutsu is that

775
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:36,249
it greatly weakens the caster
while they are using it!

776
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:40,920
<i>That brat, Ohnoki,
sure knows a lot!</i>

777
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:43,214
<i>Mu must've told him.</i>

778
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:48,424
If it's not a Mirage genjutsu,
and he can't make himself disappear…

779
00:55:48,449 --> 00:55:49,701
I should be able to sense him.

780
00:55:52,672 --> 00:55:54,298
The original is behind that rock!

781
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:58,188
Oh! Found me?

782
00:55:59,104 --> 00:56:00,738
Before the hail stops…

783
00:56:02,424 --> 00:56:04,319
I will seal you!

784
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,121
What's going on with him?

785
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:19,292
He's getting bigger and bigger!

786
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:21,544
It's like Lord Tsuchikage said.

787
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:25,757
We've trapped the original!

788
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:37,268
Hey!

789
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:38,019
Damn!

790
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,062
Whoa…

791
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:43,274
This is a perfect hiding place!

792
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:47,946
I was once one of
the Five Kage too.

793
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:53,743
As long as I have my oil,
your Sand is useless.

794
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:56,788
Unless, of course,
you seal me real fast.

795
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:58,826
Now!

796
00:56:59,289 --> 00:57:01,291
How are you going to take me down?!

797
00:57:01,705 --> 00:57:04,166
I was hoping you'd tell us.

798
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:08,466
I'm done doing that.

799
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:10,844
Sorry.

800
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:14,347
You were cooperative until just now!
What happened?

801
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:16,766
Have you decided to side
with the enemy?

802
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:18,601
You're wrong.

803
00:57:18,841 --> 00:57:21,525
I am a former Kage, after all.

804
00:57:21,978 --> 00:57:25,817
I am helping you out…
just in a different way.

805
00:57:26,569 --> 00:57:28,203
Which is what exactly?

806
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,984
If you can't win against me
using all of your abilities,

807
00:57:31,009 --> 00:57:33,219
that means you're less
than dead old me, you fool!

808
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,621
How are you gonna win against
the enemy boss like that?!

809
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:48,173
I think he's about to explode!

810
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:49,674
Retreat!

811
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:55,388
Just when I thought I'd found
the Golden Child of the Five Kage…

812
00:57:56,154 --> 00:57:59,199
Kazekage! You're just
an ordinary kid, after all!

813
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:17,911
This is…the Sand Shield?!

814
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:20,264
Lord Kazekage protected us!

815
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:22,332
But where's Lord Gaara?!

816
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,514
You protected everyone and
attacked at the same time,

817
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:39,349
knowing full well
you'd sustain damage!

818
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:45,075
Unless you stop this guy, the same
thing is going to keep happening!

819
00:59:00,811 --> 00:59:03,423
<i>The hail has stopped…
Let's see what you've got!</i>

820
00:59:07,049 --> 00:59:10,261
You mistimed getting your shield up
because of its sudden expansion!

821
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,342
Another Sand Clone?

822
00:59:14,916 --> 00:59:16,605
That's within expectations…

823
00:59:27,428 --> 00:59:30,525
I knew it.
The real one was hiding below!

824
00:59:30,873 --> 00:59:33,917
What're you going to do?
It's going to explode again!

825
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:40,535
You'll never catch him with
the speed of your Sand.

826
00:59:40,931 --> 00:59:42,030
What're you...Huh?

827
00:59:49,141 --> 00:59:50,517
<i>What's happening?</i>

828
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:52,797
<i>Did he increase the speed
of his Sand?</i>

829
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:06,227
Either way…

830
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:07,645
Ka-boom!

831
01:00:13,918 --> 01:00:15,295
More smoke!

832
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,988
They've got to be there!

833
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:25,939
<i>Is that…?</i>

834
01:00:26,904 --> 01:00:27,647
<i>Gold!</i>

835
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:31,687
<i>Did he mix that Gold Dust
his father left behind</i>

836
01:00:31,712 --> 01:00:33,774
<i>and do something to it?</i>

837
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:41,220
I hid Gold Dust in
that Sand Clone earlier.

838
01:00:42,563 --> 01:00:46,326
I took advantage of that thing's heat
to melt the gold and bond it to him.

839
01:00:46,909 --> 01:00:49,996
Gold is about 20 times
heavier than water.

840
01:00:51,215 --> 01:00:53,491
Which is why its movements
have slowed down.

841
01:00:54,301 --> 01:00:57,070
Still, why didn't it explode?

842
01:00:57,904 --> 01:01:02,033
Sand mixed with the hail was
more than enough to cool him down.

843
01:01:02,308 --> 01:01:08,007
Gold also has good conductivity,
which helped chill its steam.

844
01:01:08,614 --> 01:01:11,640
Well played. Truly befitting
a current Kage!

845
01:01:12,126 --> 01:01:15,171
I'm impressed that you came up
with such a strategy!

846
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:20,176
You really are…

847
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:24,097
the Golden Child, after all!

848
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:27,600
Are you all right, Gaara?!

849
01:01:28,141 --> 01:01:29,448
What about you?

850
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,229
We sealed the Raikage!

851
01:01:31,787 --> 01:01:33,632
I saw an explosion,

852
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:36,952
so I rushed here ahead
of Temari and the others.

853
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:38,611
I see!

854
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:40,446
I'm almost done here too.

855
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:43,324
Hey, so you have a friend!

856
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:44,534
Huh?

857
01:01:45,384 --> 01:01:47,261
W-What is this guy?!

858
01:01:47,564 --> 01:01:49,283
Man, what a weird body!

859
01:01:49,308 --> 01:01:51,768
No, that's my jutsu.

860
01:01:53,394 --> 01:01:54,504
Kazekage…

861
01:01:54,635 --> 01:01:57,281
Unlike you, he seems like an idiot!

862
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:00,758
You make a good pair.

863
01:02:07,161 --> 01:02:07,956
Really?

864
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:12,770
<i>It's been a while since
I had this much fun!</i>

865
01:02:32,855 --> 01:02:34,987
Relay our current battle status
to HQ!

866
01:02:35,353 --> 01:02:35,913
Yes, sir!

867
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:39,130
You fought well against
the former Kage, everyone!

868
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:41,507
Victory is ours for this battle!

869
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:42,967
All right!

870
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:45,470
Extract the injured and transport them
to the Medical Corps!

871
01:02:46,112 --> 01:02:49,323
Those who can still fight will
stand by for orders from HQ!

872
01:02:50,311 --> 01:02:53,022
Lord Tsuchikage, you should go
to the Medical Corps, too.

873
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:55,021
I'm fine now.

874
01:02:55,062 --> 01:02:56,606
Owww…

875
01:02:56,647 --> 01:02:58,900
Don't overdo it, old man.

876
01:02:59,598 --> 01:03:02,059
Don't treat me like an old man!

877
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:04,238
I can still take
you young ones on—

878
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:06,741
Okay, come on.

879
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,951
Let us take you to
the Medical Corps.

880
01:03:09,150 --> 01:03:10,870
Fool! Let me go!

881
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:12,789
I can walk on my own!

882
01:03:13,073 --> 01:03:16,042
You should just admit
that you're old.

883
01:03:16,153 --> 01:03:18,878
How dare you!
I am the Tsuchikage!

884
01:03:18,903 --> 01:03:20,821
Yes, I heard that yesterday too.

885
01:03:21,314 --> 01:03:23,984
Lord Gaara, please come by later.

886
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:26,844
Let go, I said!
Didn't you hear me?

887
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:28,638
We're going this way!

888
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:30,056
Owww!

889
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:32,975
Please stop moving around!
We're going.

890
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:38,481
Naruto, you're a clone, right?

891
01:03:38,637 --> 01:03:39,326
Yeah…

892
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:42,193
Then where's your original now?

893
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:48,491
I finally caught up!

894
01:03:48,689 --> 01:03:51,400
You're late!
What were you doing?

895
01:03:51,477 --> 01:03:52,976
A persistent pee, yo.

896
01:03:53,001 --> 01:03:54,628
Sheesh! It sure took long!

897
01:03:55,189 --> 01:03:57,275
Had some other problems too.

898
01:03:57,767 --> 01:04:00,436
Anyway, one of your clones
contacted me.

899
01:04:00,967 --> 01:04:02,593
What happened to
the other clones?

900
01:04:03,169 --> 01:04:06,631
They should be arriving at
the frontlines of every battlefield.

901
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:11,472
All the fakers we'll seek out
All the bad guys we'll defeat, no doubt

902
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:14,350
We gotta hurry too!

903
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:29,532
Damn, I can't tell.

904
01:04:29,721 --> 01:04:32,599
I can't sniff out
the transformed fakes.

905
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:38,958
You're back, Shino!

906
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:40,668
Yeah…

907
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:42,407
Be careful.

908
01:04:42,432 --> 01:04:44,392
There's no telling where
the enemy will come from.

909
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:52,555
So you were one of them…

910
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:53,568
Damn it!

911
01:04:54,118 --> 01:04:54,850
<i>Byakugan!</i>

912
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:00,438
It's no good.

913
01:05:00,463 --> 01:05:02,465
I can't distinguish them
from their chakra.

914
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:05,359
Are you a fake?

915
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:08,029
Stop! I'm the real one!

916
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,032
<i>Lava Style:</i>

917
01:05:13,192 --> 01:05:14,777
<i>Dissolving Jutsu!</i>

918
01:05:21,524 --> 01:05:22,817
There's no end to this.

919
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:25,004
We have to do something
about the real ones though…

920
01:05:30,509 --> 01:05:31,886
Lee, don't get hit!

921
01:05:55,701 --> 01:05:56,869
Why you…!

922
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:58,037
Do not panic!

923
01:05:58,079 --> 01:05:59,121
Surround them!

924
01:06:11,592 --> 01:06:13,427
I've detected a new enemy!

925
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:16,889
It's a small unit,
but the chakra is unusual…

926
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:19,058
It's…

927
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:20,434
Madara!

928
01:06:20,726 --> 01:06:21,978
What did you say?!

929
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:25,147
Madara is leading a small unit.

930
01:06:25,856 --> 01:06:27,608
Can you tell who makes up his unit?

931
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:29,986
This chakra is…

932
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:34,012
Fourth Mizukage!

933
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:37,201
The one who was a Jinchuriki?

934
01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:39,036
There's no mistake.

935
01:06:39,453 --> 01:06:41,288
The rest are all Jinchuriki too!

936
01:06:46,027 --> 01:06:48,613
I can't believe he had more pawns
under his control…

937
01:06:51,079 --> 01:06:51,992
Shikamaru…

938
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:54,885
How long do we have
to stay like this?

939
01:06:55,531 --> 01:06:58,742
If that huge one comes back,
won't we be in trouble?

940
01:06:59,473 --> 01:07:01,559
At least until Naruto gets here.

941
01:07:02,014 --> 01:07:05,059
Until then, do not step inside
anyone else's circle.

942
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:07,982
If you do, even you will
be considered an enemy.

943
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:12,570
We just have to verify
what we know about each other!

944
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:14,194
That won't work either.

945
01:07:14,219 --> 01:07:16,138
Several of our guys fell for that.

946
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:18,784
Sometimes, a lucky guess
ends up being correct.

947
01:07:20,857 --> 01:07:21,858
You're here!

948
01:07:22,394 --> 01:07:23,854
Finally got here!

949
01:07:25,753 --> 01:07:26,754
Nawaki?!

950
01:07:26,963 --> 01:07:28,298
Is he here?!

951
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:33,898
Oh, good.
He's gotten real flashy though…

952
01:07:33,923 --> 01:07:35,258
Naruto!

953
01:07:35,509 --> 01:07:36,510
Naruto?

954
01:07:37,135 --> 01:07:38,636
<i>He looks just like Nawaki…</i>

955
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:43,225
We received word from HQ.
I'm glad you came.

956
01:07:43,693 --> 01:07:47,211
But...I'm surprised that
Lord Raikage gave the okay for this.

957
01:07:47,672 --> 01:07:52,052
Well, Granny Tsunade convinced
Pops Raikage for me.

958
01:07:52,631 --> 01:07:54,842
Tsunade sent that boy?

959
01:07:55,529 --> 01:07:57,281
Just who is he anyway?

960
01:07:57,765 --> 01:07:59,613
The Nine-Tails is sealed inside him.

961
01:08:00,227 --> 01:08:02,661
The adults call him the Jinchuriki.

962
01:08:02,995 --> 01:08:03,967
That boy?!

963
01:08:04,890 --> 01:08:07,726
He's my idiot classmate Naruto,
who's been talking big

964
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:10,003
about becoming Hokage
ever since we were little…

965
01:08:10,294 --> 01:08:12,254
Don't you think "idiot" is
a bit harsh, Shikamaru?

966
01:08:13,150 --> 01:08:15,736
Well, I'm here and
I'll find every one of 'em!

967
01:08:16,629 --> 01:08:17,880
Naruto, huh…

968
01:08:18,739 --> 01:08:23,202
<i>So guys like Nawaki and me
exist in this period too.</i>

969
01:08:23,626 --> 01:08:27,171
So let's take down the transformed
white ones, everybody!

970
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:29,810
Hey, stop! Stay away!

971
01:08:29,944 --> 01:08:30,987
Help!

972
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:33,818
Do not approach!

973
01:08:35,057 --> 01:08:36,058
What's wrong?

974
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:39,907
He can still be saved
with medical ninjutsu!

975
01:08:40,859 --> 01:08:43,654
Stay away! I told you not to move.

976
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:47,248
There's no way to prove
that you're allies!

977
01:08:47,571 --> 01:08:48,860
But if we remain like this…

978
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:52,294
He'll die!

979
01:08:54,645 --> 01:08:57,481
I'm begging you.
Please save him!

980
01:08:57,547 --> 01:08:59,938
Don't let my husband die
in my arms!

981
01:09:04,515 --> 01:09:06,142
Hey! What are you doing?!

982
01:09:07,828 --> 01:09:11,081
If you don't trust me,
I'll kill myself right here!

983
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:14,358
But please save my husband!

984
01:09:14,793 --> 01:09:15,686
Hey, stop!

985
01:09:17,862 --> 01:09:18,637
Come with me.

986
01:09:19,134 --> 01:09:20,219
You can't. What if…?

987
01:09:20,244 --> 01:09:23,331
What if they're comrades?
I must tend to him.

988
01:09:24,618 --> 01:09:25,744
Thank you.

989
01:09:34,937 --> 01:09:36,686
Looks like you're all right!

990
01:09:38,413 --> 01:09:39,137
<i>Gentle Fist!</i>

991
01:09:41,218 --> 01:09:42,595
It was a fake, after all!

992
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:45,222
This side is bad. Hinata is…!

993
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:46,557
Neji!

994
01:09:52,604 --> 01:09:53,981
Sorry I'm late.

995
01:09:55,232 --> 01:09:57,568
Naruto…?

996
01:09:57,787 --> 01:09:58,788
Is that Naruto?

997
01:09:59,325 --> 01:10:01,649
<i>He smells different from before!</i>

998
01:10:04,598 --> 01:10:05,933
It's all right now!

999
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:25,554
Are you all right, Hinata?

1000
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:27,503
Yes.

1001
01:10:29,444 --> 01:10:31,863
Why weren't we notified right away
that Naruto was here?

1002
01:10:32,603 --> 01:10:34,563
Naruto just arrived.

1003
01:10:35,131 --> 01:10:38,551
I happened to see him first,
but I was in the midst of a battle.

1004
01:10:38,952 --> 01:10:41,329
Naruto smells differently
from before.

1005
01:10:41,445 --> 01:10:42,696
I wouldn't have noticed.

1006
01:10:43,012 --> 01:10:45,514
But you're the one
who sees long distances, so…

1007
01:10:45,608 --> 01:10:47,360
He looks different from before.

1008
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:49,620
So is his chakra nature…

1009
01:10:49,828 --> 01:10:53,374
Then who are you to talk?!

1010
01:10:53,399 --> 01:10:55,104
Are you really Naruto?

1011
01:10:55,709 --> 01:10:58,128
I hope you're not
a White Zetsu fake too.

1012
01:10:58,254 --> 01:10:59,964
I'm Naruto.

1013
01:11:00,205 --> 01:11:01,706
Can you prove it?

1014
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:03,300
It's Naruto.

1015
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:05,052
You can tell by looking in his eyes.

1016
01:11:05,345 --> 01:11:06,185
Hinata…

1017
01:11:06,852 --> 01:11:09,730
Besides, he came to my rescue.

1018
01:11:10,443 --> 01:11:12,385
Naruto saved me too.

1019
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:14,561
When did you get here?!

1020
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:17,439
I'll have you know that your fake
appeared not too long ago!

1021
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:19,275
I'm the real deal.

1022
01:11:19,745 --> 01:11:22,790
And I've been here with Naruto since.

1023
01:11:24,029 --> 01:11:25,364
I'm sorry, Naruto.

1024
01:11:25,619 --> 01:11:27,162
Everyone is so suspicious.

1025
01:11:27,476 --> 01:11:29,105
Now that I'm here,

1026
01:11:29,194 --> 01:11:30,945
you don't have to fight
a defensive battle anymore.

1027
01:11:31,310 --> 01:11:33,151
I'll search out the fakes
one by one.

1028
01:11:35,339 --> 01:11:39,260
All right, Naruto!
I've memorized your new scent.

1029
01:11:40,212 --> 01:11:41,380
And your chakra.

1030
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:46,286
Well, smell and chakra don't matter
much with their transformation.

1031
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:48,929
They mimic everything, even chakra.

1032
01:11:49,513 --> 01:11:51,015
But don't worry!

1033
01:11:51,332 --> 01:11:54,418
As you saw, they turn into trees
when I bring them down.

1034
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:58,564
And when I'm in this mode,
I can sense their hatred.

1035
01:11:59,066 --> 01:12:03,362
I'll find the fakes,
so let's beat 'em together!

1036
01:12:05,572 --> 01:12:08,867
<i>The one we're supposed to protect
is always protecting us.</i>

1037
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:11,261
Don't let it bother you, Hinata.

1038
01:12:12,004 --> 01:12:15,622
You protected me twice already. I can't
let you keep doing that. It's not cool!

1039
01:12:15,956 --> 01:12:20,127
I-I wasn't worried or anything…

1040
01:12:20,722 --> 01:12:22,224
I can see it in your eyes.

1041
01:12:22,796 --> 01:12:26,133
Don't be so hard on yourself!
You are strong!

1042
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:31,055
Don't come!

1043
01:12:32,771 --> 01:12:33,772
Let's go.

1044
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:37,102
Which one's the fake?!

1045
01:12:37,227 --> 01:12:38,729
The one with the axe!

1046
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:39,351
All right!

1047
01:12:39,376 --> 01:12:41,003
And him too!

1048
01:12:42,774 --> 01:12:44,401
<i>Thank you, Naruto.</i>

1049
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:54,995
Not so fast!

1050
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:02,753
All right!

1051
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:09,645
Do it, Sai!

1052
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:12,948
<i>Sealing Jutsu:
Crouching Tiger Bullet!</i>

1053
01:13:30,114 --> 01:13:31,990
All right! Three more left!

1054
01:13:32,282 --> 01:13:33,700
Are you all right, Sai?

1055
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:36,078
Yes...I can continue.

1056
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:38,914
No need to worry.
Keep drawing the tigers.

1057
01:13:38,956 --> 01:13:40,582
I've got your back.

1058
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:47,923
And here come
the enemy reinforcements.

1059
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:49,883
A whole lot of them too.

1060
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:52,052
They're white…

1061
01:13:52,634 --> 01:13:55,762
Are these the ones that can transform
their chakra and everything else?

1062
01:13:56,181 --> 01:13:58,100
Things are about to get wild, Kakashi.

1063
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:02,354
Our reinforcements have arrived too.

1064
01:14:02,663 --> 01:14:04,206
Or should I say,
reinforcement…in singular?

1065
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:06,984
Naruto has the Shadow Clone Jutsu!

1066
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:09,862
I can't use it now,
not in this situation.

1067
01:14:10,557 --> 01:14:13,852
This time, we'll win with quality,
not quantity!

1068
01:14:15,909 --> 01:14:17,578
And so…

1069
01:14:18,203 --> 01:14:20,831
Things have changed, Kimimaro!

1070
01:14:21,948 --> 01:14:25,243
I can tell that time has passed
by looking at you.

1071
01:14:25,709 --> 01:14:29,463
It seems you've grown in ways
other than just height.

1072
01:14:30,134 --> 01:14:31,677
Here I come!

1073
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:42,936
I put too much force into it…

1074
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:44,354
What happened?

1075
01:14:44,804 --> 01:14:47,733
He's just as scatterbrained
and rash as ever.

1076
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:49,359
For sure…

1077
01:14:49,568 --> 01:14:51,320
Impossible, is that…?

1078
01:14:51,713 --> 01:14:53,632
Oh yes, it is.

1079
01:14:54,072 --> 01:14:57,117
Naruto has arrived at
every battlefield!

1080
01:14:57,826 --> 01:14:58,915
Good.

1081
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:03,248
Naruto has joined up with
the Fourth Company.

1082
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:06,336
And the Former Kage of
the Wind, Lightning, Earth and Water…

1083
01:15:06,361 --> 01:15:08,796
have all been successfully sealed.
