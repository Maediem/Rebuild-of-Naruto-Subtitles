1
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,266
The Ten-Tails disappeared?

2
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:44,061
What's going on?
Did they defeat it?

3
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,230
No...

4
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,148
Hinata! Did you see it?

5
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,691
Yeah!

6
00:01:49,084 --> 00:01:51,419
Can you explain what happened?

7
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:05,416
Ten-Tails was completely
absorbed into that man.

8
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,627
Based on looking at its chakra.

9
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,922
Don't tell me...

10
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,728
That's the Ten-Tails'...

11
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,321
Jinchuriki?

12
00:02:36,046 --> 00:02:38,715
He looks even creepier
than before!

13
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,493
Obito...

14
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:42,620
Naruto...

15
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,789
How can you tell
he's a Jinchuriki?

16
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,834
I've become friends
with the Tailed Beasts.

17
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,696
They gave me some
of their chakra earlier,

18
00:02:50,721 --> 00:02:52,515
so it's obvious to me.

19
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:56,526
I could sense the Tailed Beasts' chakra
getting sucked into Obito

20
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,052
one after the other.

21
00:02:58,987 --> 00:03:03,700
Plus, I've seen Nagato do that
Six Paths Rebirth Jutsu before.

22
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:09,230
But the signs he was weaving
were completely different!

23
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,091
Anyway, he was performing
the jutsu

24
00:03:12,116 --> 00:03:14,118
to become a Jinchuriki
all this time.

25
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:15,653
I see...

26
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,831
<i>Eight-o! Is that the final form?</i>

27
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,543
<i>No, it's not.</i>

28
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,463
<i>It's hard to explain,
but that isn't it.</i>

29
00:03:33,488 --> 00:03:36,441
<i>Looks like Ten-Tails was
used to create a Jinchuriki</i>

30
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,259
<i>before it reached its final form.</i>

31
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,574
<i>Even if you have become
a Jinchuriki,</i>

32
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,851
<i>the Gracious Deity Gates
are still in play.</i>

33
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,191
Whoa! Amazing!

34
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,424
<i>The Sage Art Seal that
suppressed the Ten-Tails was...</i>

35
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:21,026
<i>Such power...</i>

36
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,028
What?!

37
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,233
Impossible!

38
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,252
The Four Crimson Rays Formation!

39
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,770
Is it just me,

40
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,298
or is he stronger than
when he was gigantic?

41
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:02,010
<i>Before, it was just throwing
its power around.</i>

42
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,496
<i>But now, it's learned to focus it.</i>

43
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,057
Everyone, keep your guard up!

44
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,735
We don't know what that man,

45
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,305
who made the Ten-Tails' power
his own, might do!

46
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,274
He's broken the barrier!

47
00:05:25,432 --> 00:05:27,809
Enough! Obito, stop this!

48
00:05:31,614 --> 00:05:34,375
O...bi...to?

49
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:44,010
I'll be blunt.
This guy is stronger than me!

50
00:05:44,718 --> 00:05:47,638
No offense, but it appears so.

51
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,199
Even if you reabsorb
your remaining clones,

52
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,726
you're no match, Elder Brother!

53
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,085
I know.

54
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,146
However...

55
00:06:08,183 --> 00:06:11,728
It would be fun to watch
all the Hokage beg for mercy,

56
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:14,098
but I cannot wait any longer.

57
00:06:18,395 --> 00:06:21,506
<i>Obito is now just like
the Sage of Six Paths.</i>

58
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:24,982
<i>I can't let him take the lead
before I use my trump card.</i>

59
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:30,797
What's happened?

60
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,923
He's so fast!

61
00:06:31,948 --> 00:06:33,908
Saru! Fourth! Scram!

62
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:38,022
<i>This is Lord Second's attack plan!</i>

63
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:44,169
– Elder Brother!
– Mm-hmm!

64
00:06:48,598 --> 00:06:50,517
Minato, get away!

65
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,954
Lord Second, you sure work fast!

66
00:06:53,405 --> 00:06:54,463
<i>Flying Raijin Jutsu!</i>

67
00:06:56,414 --> 00:06:58,959
I suspected that might
not be enough to kill you...

68
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,421
I created the Reanimation Jutsu,

69
00:07:01,695 --> 00:07:03,198
as well as ancillary jutsu
to go with it.

70
00:07:05,574 --> 00:07:08,160
Though this is the first time
I'm using it on myself.

71
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,809
<i>There it is!
The Lord Second's special...</i>

72
00:07:14,983 --> 00:07:16,985
<i>Tandem Explosive Tags!</i>

73
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,312
This is how it's done!

74
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:22,291
<i>Each tag summons more tags,
resulting in continuous explosions.</i>

75
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,819
<i>Concentrated and focused
consecutive explosions!</i>

76
00:07:35,863 --> 00:07:38,950
This is too much!
What's going on? I can't keep up!

77
00:07:39,116 --> 00:07:40,367
Don't freak out!

78
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,412
Always keep one eye on
what's happening around you!

79
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:53,431
I don't care if that is
the Jinchuriki of the Ten-Tails!

80
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,142
The Lords Hokage are
engaged in battle!

81
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,226
We have to join them!

82
00:07:57,251 --> 00:07:58,495
Don't be hasty! We need to—!

83
00:07:58,636 --> 00:08:01,539
All of you!
You must not approach heedlessly!

84
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,781
What is he?

85
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,047
<i>He's solid and swift.</i>

86
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,866
<i>And he has an attack that
turns all to dust in an instant!</i>

87
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:36,157
<i>Shuriken Shadow Clones!</i>

88
00:08:46,368 --> 00:08:49,779
<i>It's similar to Ohnoki's Particle Style,
but its shape is fluid.</i>

89
00:08:49,804 --> 00:08:52,056
<i>It can shift to be either
offensive or defensive.</i>

90
00:08:52,081 --> 00:08:53,540
<i>And can be continuously maintained.</i>

91
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:02,683
<i>I suspect it's a combination of more
than four changes in chakra nature!</i>

92
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:06,170
<i>This is more than a kekkei genkai
or even a kekkei touta...</i>

93
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,286
<i>But there seems to be
a time limit to how long</i>

94
00:09:13,311 --> 00:09:14,979
<i>he can use each
change in chakra form.</i>

95
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:22,812
Gramps!

96
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:27,942
Dad! You couldn't teleport
Grandpa Third with your jutsu too?

97
00:09:28,142 --> 00:09:31,145
It's impossible. I can't teleport
anything that I myself,

98
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,589
or my chakra isn't touching directly.

99
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,658
Calm down, Naruto.

100
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,743
The Hokage are Reanimations.

101
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,746
They intentionally attacked head-on
knowing that they won't die,

102
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,666
in order to check out
the enemy's moves and abilities.

103
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:47,820
Stop worrying and analyze
the battle instead.

104
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,465
<i>So that's Sasuke...
He's extremely smart.</i>

105
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:55,519
Although it still takes a while
for a Reanimation to regenerate.

106
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,645
I'll go first and create an opening!

107
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:07,740
At this point, I feel the need to...

108
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:14,739
I'm done waiting, Hashirama!

109
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,000
W-What's going on?

110
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:34,884
<i>I get it...</i>

111
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,512
<i>Ten-Tails hasn't completely
synched with its Jinchuriki yet.</i>

112
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:40,989
<i>This is our chance to take it down!</i>

113
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:43,142
<i>I'll summon my original here then!</i>

114
00:10:44,968 --> 00:10:46,845
It's been a while, but it's time

115
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,123
for my Rasen-Flash Super-Circle
Dance Howl Stage Three!

116
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,782
Gamakichi! Below you!

117
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,918
He passed underground!
It's just his upper body!

118
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,851
Damn it!

119
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,236
You're not the one...

120
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:42,118
...who's going to sever the past. I am!

121
00:11:48,665 --> 00:11:49,733
I hope this makes it in time!

122
00:11:49,758 --> 00:11:51,302
<i>Flying Raijin Jutsu!</i>

123
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,696
<i>My markings on Obito disappeared?</i>

124
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,434
Damn it!

125
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,109
Owww...

126
00:12:15,308 --> 00:12:17,185
I thought we were going to die!

127
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:23,659
<i>Looks like my boy is
as accomplished as Sasuke.</i>

128
00:12:24,484 --> 00:12:25,485
<i>Now then...</i>

129
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,096
What is that?

130
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,056
We have to take him down

131
00:12:46,439 --> 00:12:48,232
while he's still unable
to use his body well.

132
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,426
Was he after your clone
just now, Dad?

133
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:25,287
No, I don't think that was it...

134
00:13:33,371 --> 00:13:35,731
What? What happened?!

135
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:38,617
He hit himself with his own attack.

136
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,061
His attack missed.

137
00:13:41,546 --> 00:13:46,100
Seems Obito's consciousness is
merely clinging to Ten Tail's great power.

138
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,077
He barely has any control over it.

139
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,238
This time, I'll get

140
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:52,765
the Rasen-Flash Super-Circle
Dance Howl Stage Three in for sure!

141
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,250
I'll create an opening,

142
00:13:54,274 --> 00:13:57,486
so you two hit him immediately
with your strongest combo!

143
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,047
Rin...

144
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,680
<i>Of course,
I'm going to be the Hokage!</i>

145
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,271
<i>And then...</i>

146
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,790
<i>I won't have any time for girls!</i>

147
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,692
<i>Right, Sensei?</i>

148
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,682
Here I come, Obito!

149
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,564
Who...are...you?

150
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,543
Finally, Sensei...

151
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:10,869
<i>Damn it!</i>

152
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:15,849
Dad!

153
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,243
Naruto, focus!

154
00:16:18,786 --> 00:16:20,813
He got me, but I'm okay!

155
00:16:21,546 --> 00:16:22,589
Are you sure about that?

156
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:25,818
<i>When did he...?!</i>

157
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,198
<i>I'll have to teleport it away
with me!</i>

158
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,795
You can have this back.

159
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,303
Don't worry.

160
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,055
I only teleported a clone.

161
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,852
I marked him that last time
we were in contact.

162
00:17:06,232 --> 00:17:09,209
Amazing! You can copy
my dad's move!

163
00:17:09,475 --> 00:17:11,395
Impressive,
Second Great Stone Face-guy!

164
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,742
Lord Fourth is using my move!

165
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,619
And just call me "Lord Second"!

166
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,626
Get out of my way, Madara!

167
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,378
I don't have much time,

168
00:17:26,903 --> 00:17:29,081
but there's something
I've got to do now!

169
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:34,660
<i>Wood Style: Wood Golem Jutsu!</i>

170
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:01,997
A-Amazing!

171
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:03,748
They're on a completely
different level!

172
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:07,477
So this is the battle capacity
of our predecessors!

173
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,881
If we went out there...

174
00:18:10,906 --> 00:18:13,325
we would just get
in their way for sure.

175
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,182
Did he get him?

176
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,703
He blocked it, huh? He's fast.

177
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,706
We won't be able to hit him
with ordinary jutsu.

178
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,840
I guess I'll have to make an opening

179
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:57,119
with my Rasen-Flash Super-Circle
Dance Howl Stage Three...

180
00:18:57,961 --> 00:18:59,171
<i>Amaterasu!</i>

181
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:06,227
Sasuke! Naruto! I said
I would create an opening for you!

182
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,105
I'll do it!

183
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,940
No, we will!

184
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,984
We'll let Dad and the others
be the main act!

185
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,697
I could tell you were
amassing chakra in your left eye.

186
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,557
Hardly a surprise attack.

187
00:19:19,474 --> 00:19:20,576
Let's go, Fourth.

188
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,037
A clone's Flying Raijin
is much slower.

189
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,000
Let's combine and
reciprocate our Flying Raijin.

190
00:19:28,217 --> 00:19:30,636
Go ahead and put your mark on me.

191
00:19:31,102 --> 00:19:31,903
Yes, sir.

192
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:36,049
Plus with these bodies,
we can still move after being hit!

193
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:42,097
Naruto, this time, I'll match
your chakra level using my Sharingan.

194
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:45,669
No need to turn it into a competition!

195
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,858
– <i>Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken!</i>
– <i>Inferno Style: Flame Control!</i>

196
00:20:07,856 --> 00:20:09,274
You two are the main act!

197
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:11,919
Distracted by what's going on
in front of you?

198
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:13,562
Now!

199
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,547
– <i>Reciprocal Round-Robin Jutsu!</i>
– <i>Reciprocal Round-Robin Jutsu!</i>

200
00:20:15,772 --> 00:20:16,900
– <i>Flying Raijin Jutsu!</i>
– <i>Flying Raijin Jutsu!</i>

201
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:23,205
I name it the Scorch Style
Nimbus Tempest!

202
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,265
Just keep on going as planned!

203
00:20:35,992 --> 00:20:38,035
Hinata! What's going on with
Naruto and Sasuke?

204
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,614
They're both...

205
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,576
smiling...

206
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:53,085
I got in a direct hit before
those black things could protect him.

207
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,462
He should have felt that one.

208
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:12,912
No effect at all.

209
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:15,882
We can't touch those black,
transforming spheres...

210
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,402
Our attacks have
no effect on him...

211
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,654
He's quick on both offense
and defense...

212
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:22,656
What a pain.

213
00:21:24,707 --> 00:21:29,504
He's even more perfect than
how I imagine myself in my dreams!

214
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:33,332
It's like he's truly obtained
dreamlike power.

215
00:21:35,243 --> 00:21:36,536
That's odd.

216
00:21:37,711 --> 00:21:38,796
What is?

217
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,808
Your arm was ripped off...

218
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:46,054
There should be dust swirling
around to restore it by now.

219
00:21:48,673 --> 00:21:51,134
Our reanimated bodies
aren't regenerating...

220
00:21:56,030 --> 00:22:01,035
I have come to possess the same power
as the Founder of Shinobi.

221
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:07,225
You can no longer measure me
by the standards you are used to.

222
00:22:09,936 --> 00:22:12,355
Don't tell me, your jutsu...!

223
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:17,169
What does he mean by the same power
as the Founder of Shinobi?

224
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,295
Fourth...

225
00:22:19,036 --> 00:22:24,041
Try not to get seriously injured again,
even with our reanimated bodies...

226
00:22:24,884 --> 00:22:27,178
He's probably using
a jutsu based

227
00:22:27,203 --> 00:22:31,123
on Shadow and Light Styles
that nullify all ninjutsu.

228
00:22:32,134 --> 00:22:35,179
In other words, if he destroys
our reanimated bodies...

229
00:22:35,736 --> 00:22:38,405
we'll be unable to regenerate,
and we'll die!

230
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:44,488
Also...assume that right arm
of yours is permanently gone.

231
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:49,242
If that's the case, we'll need
to fight him even more carefully...

232
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:54,171
But since ninjutsu won't work on him,
this will be tricky.

233
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:56,266
How about physical attacks?

234
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:57,934
Let's try it out.

235
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,337
Sasuke...

236
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,380
What?

237
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,949
We're going to have to take the lead.

238
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,592
Think you can keep up?

239
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,261
Don't underestimate the Uchiha.

240
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:10,605
All right!

241
00:23:10,672 --> 00:23:14,009
I'll up my Kurama Mode and
go into Tailed Beast State!

242
00:23:19,323 --> 00:23:20,273
Huh?

243
00:23:20,908 --> 00:23:24,633
Kurama! Lend me
a little more chakra!

244
00:23:25,244 --> 00:23:27,663
<i>Hold off on going into
Nine-Tails State for just a bit!</i>

245
00:23:27,931 --> 00:23:30,415
But he's not someone
we can beat without it.

246
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:33,912
<i>If you want to enter into
Perfect Tailed Beast State,</i>

247
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:36,415
<i>you're going to have to fight
in normal mode for a bit.</i>

248
00:23:39,843 --> 00:23:41,827
<i>Syrup Gun!</i>

249
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,135
A toad from Mount Myoboku?

250
00:23:48,401 --> 00:23:49,819
What was that about Gamakichi?

251
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:52,097
If you're going make a move,
do something diversionary or a combo...

252
00:23:53,248 --> 00:23:57,043
Sorry, but we're approaching
the time limit for the summoning.

253
00:23:57,318 --> 00:24:00,571
I just wanted to repay him
with a parting shot!

254
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:05,635
Thanks for the effort!
Go get some rest!

255
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:07,587
Sorry about this.

256
00:24:25,022 --> 00:24:26,023
<i>This is...</i>

257
00:24:26,181 --> 00:24:29,684
Obito, I thought you wanted
to become Hokage.

258
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,194
Why are you doing this?

259
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:32,946
You want to know why?

260
00:24:33,971 --> 00:24:35,223
<i>This is my chance!</i>

261
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,433
Lecturing me now?

262
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:41,104
Isn't it a bit late for that...Sensei?

263
00:24:44,565 --> 00:24:48,069
You're always too late
when it matters most.

264
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,990
I'm glad my teacher was a Hokage.

265
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,771
It made it easy to give up
on becoming Hokage.

266
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:04,586
<i>He got past Lord Third's
personal ANBU Black Ops,</i>

267
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:07,339
<i>infiltrated a top-secret barrier,</i>

268
00:25:07,789 --> 00:25:09,048
<i>and knew that the seal</i>

269
00:25:09,073 --> 00:25:11,492
<i>on the Nine-Tails would be
at its weakest during childbirth...</i>

270
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,638
<i>Are you Madara Uchiha?</i>

271
00:25:15,446 --> 00:25:19,101
Even though you were my teacher,
you didn't realize it was me.

272
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,763
That's just who
you are fundamentally.

273
00:25:23,805 --> 00:25:25,181
How pathetic...

274
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:28,259
You died a heroic Hokage,

275
00:25:28,284 --> 00:25:31,079
but now you're being exposed
as a disgrace in front of your son.

276
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:34,658
That's right...

277
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:39,921
A Hokage is a pitiable existence...
compared to what I am now.

278
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,375
<i>Apparently the kid's not a goofball.</i>

279
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,085
<i>He's caught on!</i>

280
00:25:46,468 --> 00:25:48,470
You have no right to
make fun of a Hokage

281
00:25:48,495 --> 00:25:50,664
when you couldn't even
become one yourself.

282
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:53,051
Naruto, you—!

283
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,765
Especially my dad...
who actually became Hokage.

284
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:02,969
How dare you put him down!

285
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:10,569
That worked?!
Why? How?

286
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:19,494
<i>It's effective! I knew it!</i>

287
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:23,665
<i>Even if ninjutsu is ineffective,
Sage Jutsu still works!</i>

288
00:26:25,057 --> 00:26:28,358
<i>The toad from Mount Myoboku
used Sage Jutsu</i>

289
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:30,239
<i>and his attack wasn't nullified.</i>

290
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,507
You bastard!

291
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,054
That's amazing, Naruto...

292
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,723
What's going on?

293
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,183
His Sage Jutsu is working!

294
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:54,446
<i>He's even mastered the same
Sage Jutsu as Jiraiya Sensei...</i>

295
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:59,734
<i>He's grown into quite a son, eh, Minato?</i>

296
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:09,711
<i>It's no wonder he managed
to sweet talk my other half.</i>

297
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:22,315
<i>Minato...You intended for your brat to
clean up after your mess, right?</i>

298
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:27,754
<i>That's why you sealed
my other half inside him…</i>

299
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,608
<i>as if you were confident they would
be able to work together.</i>

300
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,027
Nine-Tails…

301
00:27:34,869 --> 00:27:37,455
<i>Then don't regret it now.</i>

302
00:27:38,205 --> 00:27:41,208
<i>It's not your fault
that Kushina died.</i>

303
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:46,164
<i>And making your brat into
a Jinchuriki wasn't a bad thing either.</i>

304
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:50,627
<i>Because your brat is trying
to change...</i>

305
00:27:50,868 --> 00:27:53,954
<i>what this world has
become right now.</i>

306
00:27:54,088 --> 00:27:56,716
<i>He's not that
newborn babe anymore.</i>

307
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:59,185
<i>In fact, tomorrow is...</i>

308
00:28:00,503 --> 00:28:01,587
<i>Naruto…</i>

309
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:06,142
<i>Listen up...I need to
tell you something...</i>

310
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:11,356
I can't believe the Ten-Tails'
Jinchuriki has such a weakness!

311
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:16,202
<i>And with Ten-Tails inside me,
I can't pass through things either!</i>

312
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:19,197
<i>How frustrating!</i>

313
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:24,202
Sage moves will work!

314
00:28:24,643 --> 00:28:25,894
Sage Power?

315
00:28:26,313 --> 00:28:29,099
The toad attacks are Sage Jutsu…

316
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,834
They use Nature Energy.

317
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,754
Come to think of it, when I tried
to sense Ten-Tails' power,

318
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,881
it was Nature Energy itself.

319
00:28:37,423 --> 00:28:41,711
So you can maybe counter
Nature Energy with Nature Energy.

320
00:28:42,335 --> 00:28:44,112
Not that I really understand it.

321
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:48,635
I'm just glad I learned
Sage Jutsu! All right!

322
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,646
Next up is Frog Kumite!

323
00:28:57,586 --> 00:29:00,922
<i>He instantly grasped how to use
the Flying Raijin with me...</i>

324
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:03,575
<i>and has even mastered
Sage Power.</i>

325
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:07,829
<i>I feel like I'm fighting
alongside Elder Brother!</i>

326
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,046
It clearly worked.
But he's recovered already,

327
00:29:17,263 --> 00:29:19,724
and now he's guarding his back.

328
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:24,328
<i>If we teleport behind him carelessly,
we might get erased.</i>

329
00:29:31,844 --> 00:29:34,180
I should start preparing for
the Tsukuyomi.

330
00:29:34,404 --> 00:29:36,031
Let's tidy things up.

331
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:57,128
There is nothing worth saving
in this reality.

332
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,592
This world is already dead.

333
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,995
Hey...This is super bad!

334
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,064
Four of them…all at once?

335
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:19,025
Even if we were to create
an Earth Style Wall,

336
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:20,543
it wouldn't be enough!

337
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:21,861
There are too many of them!

338
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:25,898
<i>What do we do? Think!</i>

339
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,676
It would take one person
per each of those

340
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:30,286
to teleport away using
the Flying Raijin.

341
00:30:31,312 --> 00:30:33,731
The Fourth and I can get
to two of them,

342
00:30:34,063 --> 00:30:36,065
but that leaves two others!
Impossible!

343
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,378
Where's Elder Brother?

344
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,673
Madara! Could you wait a moment?

345
00:30:42,031 --> 00:30:43,992
Your comrade is acting up...!

346
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:46,302
We are all Reanimations!

347
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:47,762
There's no need to worry!

348
00:30:48,087 --> 00:30:49,429
Keep fighting!

349
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,934
Do not give up everyone!

350
00:30:53,293 --> 00:30:55,845
I am with you!
My clones are with you!

351
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:58,406
We only need to change
the spheres' trajectories!

352
00:30:58,431 --> 00:31:00,049
The other Hokage will
also take measures

353
00:31:00,074 --> 00:31:02,117
and repel them across the ocean!

354
00:31:02,418 --> 00:31:04,494
I ask that you all work on putting up
an Earth Style Wall!

355
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:05,947
I'll use the Deep Forest
Emergence to launch

356
00:31:05,972 --> 00:31:08,099
and guide them to
toward the ocean!

357
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:09,741
I won't let you!

358
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,286
<i>Six Crimson Ray Formation!</i>

359
00:31:28,744 --> 00:31:29,671
A barrier!

360
00:31:29,696 --> 00:31:32,174
Hey! Don't tell me we're...

361
00:31:37,194 --> 00:31:38,821
Endgame.

362
00:31:39,421 --> 00:31:41,757
Our only choice now is
to teleport those spheres

363
00:31:41,782 --> 00:31:43,618
outside the barrier using
the Flying Raijin.

364
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:46,387
Fourth, can you handle two of them?

365
00:31:47,354 --> 00:31:50,649
Since we can't mark them,
I can only take one.

366
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:52,943
There's only one way.

367
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,289
<i>We could...</i>

368
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:59,834
You intend to teleport
the stalk itself outside?

369
00:32:00,242 --> 00:32:01,827
You think I'd let you do that?

370
00:32:02,403 --> 00:32:04,405
You can't save anyone!

371
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,593
Dad!

372
00:32:09,626 --> 00:32:12,921
I don't know if it will work,
but I've got an idea.

373
00:32:15,374 --> 00:32:17,543
Will you bump fists with me?

374
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:31,240
<i>Hey, other half. How ya been?</i>

375
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:34,410
<i>Do you mind sharing some
of your chakra with me?</i>

376
00:32:34,951 --> 00:32:35,952
Naruto…

377
00:32:36,444 --> 00:32:38,655
Minato's useless,
he can't do anything.

378
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:41,333
He couldn't even
protect your mom...

379
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,672
Nor his own subordinates.

380
00:32:50,117 --> 00:32:52,703
You know what tomorrow is,
don't you?

381
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:58,184
It's the anniversary of
Minato and Kushina's deaths.

382
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:02,522
In this world, it's over
when you die.

383
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:03,564
You see...

384
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:06,567
Oh, right, which means...

385
00:33:07,043 --> 00:33:08,611
it's also the day I was born!

386
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,155
So you see...

387
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,115
It's not over...

388
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:17,744
'Cuz I exist in this world!

389
00:33:18,445 --> 00:33:19,822
Let's go, Dad!

390
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:20,932
Yeah!

391
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,678
<i>Thank goodness for
the chakra of you two!</i>

392
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,805
<i>It's just as I thought!</i>

393
00:33:36,238 --> 00:33:40,492
<i>Yeah well, the both of us
used to be one, after all.</i>

394
00:33:41,277 --> 00:33:45,615
<i>Plus...those two are
father and son.</i>

395
00:33:47,634 --> 00:33:48,635
Naruto...

396
00:33:48,676 --> 00:33:49,427
Huh?

397
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:54,132
I wish there was more time
to talk to the grown-up you!

398
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,826
Guys don't need to talk!

399
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,536
I already know!

400
00:34:03,859 --> 00:34:07,612
I...already met Mom's chakra...

401
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:12,717
What you want to say is the same
as my nagging mom, right?!

402
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,719
I already know!

403
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,357
What's your plan, Naruto?

404
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:32,528
Just...give me some time to focus...

405
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:37,116
<i>Let me explain what
Kurama and I came up with.</i>

406
00:34:37,749 --> 00:34:40,352
<i>You tell me if
it will work or not, okay?</i>

407
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,916
<i>All right, go ahead!</i>

408
00:34:49,311 --> 00:34:52,106
<i>I'm so sorry, Naruto...</i>

409
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:57,929
<i>I'm sure you must have had it
real tough up until now!</i>

410
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:01,599
The real tough part
is about to start, Dad!

411
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,420
This is Naruto's…!

412
00:35:16,138 --> 00:35:18,198
So…it wasn't depleted?!

413
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:21,585
I noticed it when
I was healing everyone, but…

414
00:35:22,244 --> 00:35:24,746
It seems it had merely shrunk down.

415
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:28,417
It's bigger and more powerful
than before!

416
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,546
Have ya noticed Eight-o?

417
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:35,007
I sense two Nine-Tails,
one light and one dark, yo!

418
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,927
<i>This isn't just Nine-Tails.</i>

419
00:35:38,694 --> 00:35:41,272
You're thinking about
protecting us from that attack

420
00:35:41,297 --> 00:35:43,466
with this chakra, Naruto?

421
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,151
Jugo.

422
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:58,114
Sasuke, this is looking bad.
Let's get outside of this barrier.

423
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,449
Use the Snake Reverse Summoning.

424
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,160
That was my plan already.

425
00:36:02,902 --> 00:36:05,404
I'll take you and Naruto
with me.

426
00:36:06,072 --> 00:36:08,991
I haven't given you
any of my chakra yet.

427
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,751
Get over here, will ya?

428
00:36:12,562 --> 00:36:14,856
What's your chakra
going to accomplish?

429
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:17,258
There's no time! Just hurry!

430
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:24,724
I can't believe he shared
his chakra with every shinobi!

431
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:27,310
He's got almost as
much chakra as us!

432
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:29,762
No!

433
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:32,356
Actually, this has
Nine-Tails' chakra mixed in!

434
00:36:33,315 --> 00:36:35,859
That won't help you
withstand the shock wave of

435
00:36:35,884 --> 00:36:39,021
four Ten-Tails' Tailed Beast
Bombs exploding together!

436
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:41,498
Begone...

437
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:26,535
What?

438
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:30,289
What happened?

439
00:37:32,233 --> 00:37:34,944
This chakra protected us again!

440
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,546
Not quite, check it out!

441
00:37:38,647 --> 00:37:39,690
We're...

442
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,985
outside the barrier?

443
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:48,348
It was the Teleportation Jutsu.

444
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:51,727
Damn that Naruto!
He's even mastered that too?

445
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,356
This isn't just Naruto's chakra.

446
00:37:55,664 --> 00:38:00,169
<i>He moved everyone using
the Fourth Hokage's Flying Raijin Jutsu!</i>

447
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,363
Fourth…

448
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:07,285
This is the second time
you've saved all of shinobi-kind.

449
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:15,668
I've still failed...

450
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,789
more times than that,

451
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,843
so I must continue making up for it.

452
00:38:26,444 --> 00:38:27,445
What did you do?

453
00:38:28,798 --> 00:38:33,519
Dad teleported everyone
outside the barrier.

454
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:35,521
Everyone? With that jutsu?

455
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:42,152
I'd shared Kurama's and
my chakra with everyone earlier.

456
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:47,400
So if Dad, and our chakra
and everybody were to uh...um...

457
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:48,468
Indirectly…

458
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,579
Right! If we were all
in indirect contact with each other,

459
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,913
it would work.

460
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,751
So, I connected Dad's chakra
with Kurama's and mine.

461
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:58,294
That's all!

462
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,797
He used the principle
of Shadow Clones.

463
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:05,009
Even if you split up and
disperse your chakra...

464
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:07,752
as long as you keep even a little
bit there without putting it out...

465
00:39:07,894 --> 00:39:11,648
when the original body infuses
chakra again to regain control,

466
00:39:11,673 --> 00:39:15,010
all the individual chakra bits
begin resonating and link together.

467
00:39:15,301 --> 00:39:19,931
In short, by joining his chakra
with the Fourth's,

468
00:39:20,128 --> 00:39:22,760
Naruto linked the Fourth
to the rest of his chakra

469
00:39:22,785 --> 00:39:24,703
residing in everyone else.

470
00:39:25,311 --> 00:39:26,813
Right, Naruto?

471
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:29,015
Huh? Is that what I did?

472
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,451
Never mind…

473
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:34,580
Old Man Second, you sure know
a lot about my Shadow Clones too!

474
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,332
I created that jutsu!

475
00:39:36,691 --> 00:39:38,167
It's my Shadow Clone Jutsu!

476
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:45,466
<i>This feeling is so familiar...</i>

477
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,056
<i>Even though we're out of options,</i>

478
00:39:49,736 --> 00:39:52,239
<i>it feels like we can
accomplish anything...</i>

479
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:59,855
<i>That's right! It's just like
when I was with Kushina!</i>

480
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,529
I feel power welling up inside me!

481
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:08,246
Let's go!

482
00:40:10,024 --> 00:40:12,026
<i>Naruto's got this much chakra?</i>

483
00:40:12,826 --> 00:40:15,495
Naruto! Letting out a shout
and showing off

484
00:40:15,555 --> 00:40:17,031
is all well and good...

485
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:19,417
but don't tell me
you've already forgotten...

486
00:40:19,982 --> 00:40:23,611
that nothing other than
Sage Jutsu works against him?

487
00:40:23,978 --> 00:40:25,372
I know you're not an idiot!

488
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,194
That's right!

489
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:33,138
You're a bigger idiot
than my elder brother!

490
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:41,981
<i>It looks like you've surpassed
all the previous Hokage, in stupidity!</i>

491
00:40:42,372 --> 00:40:46,126
Shut up! Stupid, stupid Kurama!

492
00:40:47,185 --> 00:40:49,730
<i>Fools are easily liked
and trusted by others.</i>

493
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:54,076
<i>It'll be all right.
Don't worry about it.</i>

494
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,997
I-I'm not worried that I'm an idiot!

495
00:40:58,539 --> 00:40:59,999
<i>I'm not talking about that.</i>

496
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:00,833
Huh?

497
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:04,579
<i>I'm saying that you might
be able to go into Sage Mode</i>

498
00:41:04,986 --> 00:41:06,988
<i>while you're in that state.</i>

499
00:41:08,189 --> 00:41:12,610
<i>Listen up...You've probably
already forgotten,</i>

500
00:41:12,936 --> 00:41:17,190
<i>but during your final battle
with Pain, Nagato...</i>

501
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:24,640
<i>I got so mad by what he was saying
that my chakra leaked out,</i>

502
00:41:24,723 --> 00:41:28,477
<i>even though you were
in Sage Mode at that time.</i>

503
00:41:28,744 --> 00:41:35,668
<i>My power and your Sage Power
actually managed to synchronize.</i>

504
00:41:38,979 --> 00:41:42,892
You say that, but back when
I was undergoing Sage Training,

505
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:45,878
you interfered with Gramps Sage's
Sage Jutsu, remember?

506
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:50,121
<i>That's because I had no interest
in sharing the same space with toads!</i>

507
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:55,971
<i>Besides, it really pissed me off
that you would rely on Sage Jutsu</i>

508
00:41:55,996 --> 00:41:57,481
<i>when you had my chakra.</i>

509
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:02,553
You stubborn bastard!

510
00:42:02,945 --> 00:42:04,897
<i>You're the stubborn one!</i>

511
00:42:05,499 --> 00:42:07,041
Anyway, what I'm trying to say is,

512
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:09,526
<i>that I'm willing to let you use</i>

513
00:42:09,551 --> 00:42:11,929
<i>both my power and
Sage Power right now.</i>

514
00:42:12,462 --> 00:42:15,074
<i>What's stubborn about that,
damn it?!</i>

515
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:19,028
You just can't be up front about
your feelings, can you?

516
00:42:19,053 --> 00:42:22,640
<i>You bastard! You've been
making fun of me a lot lately!</i>

517
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:29,463
It's not like that...
It's out of familiarity...

518
00:42:33,475 --> 00:42:36,228
<i>Using Tailed Beast State with
Sage Jutsu at the same time, huh...</i>

519
00:42:37,237 --> 00:42:39,656
<i>You've got the same me
inside you as your son.</i>

520
00:42:39,815 --> 00:42:42,984
<i>You should be able to provide him
with powerful support.</i>

521
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:44,186
Yeah...

522
00:42:46,203 --> 00:42:48,080
I already know that!

523
00:42:56,798 --> 00:42:58,550
<i>I'll have some jutsu prepared too!</i>

524
00:43:01,144 --> 00:43:04,564
<i>I'm absorbing Nature Energy
a lot faster in this state.</i>

525
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:11,713
All right!

526
00:43:24,751 --> 00:43:27,587
Naruto, add Sage Jutsu
to the Rasengan!

527
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:28,897
Okay!

528
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,150
Old Man Second!

529
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,552
Let's do it!

530
00:43:36,338 --> 00:43:37,589
<i>Just forge ahead!</i>

531
00:43:38,381 --> 00:43:41,676
<i>We'll ward off his attacks
with our chakra!</i>

532
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,335
– <i>Rasengan!</i>
– <i>Rasengan!</i>

533
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:28,207
That black thing sure is solid!

534
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:29,833
Damn it...

535
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:32,002
He blocked us this time!

536
00:44:32,744 --> 00:44:34,537
He predicted our attack...

537
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:37,800
Using only the Flying Raijin
in our strategy isn't enough.

538
00:44:38,141 --> 00:44:41,019
Our only option is to destroy
that black thing!

539
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:42,520
But how?

540
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:45,273
All right, next up...

541
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:49,662
Let's try adding Sage Jutsu
to a Tailed Beast Bomb!

542
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:52,272
All right, excellent idea!

543
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:57,195
<i>You might just surpass
my Elder Brother as Hokage...</i>

544
00:45:02,632 --> 00:45:04,634
Hey, other Kurama! You help too!

545
00:45:05,052 --> 00:45:06,611
I like the sound of that!

546
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:14,419
<i>This is what Naruto is
capable of now?</i>

547
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:17,881
<i>He's able to control this much
chakra perfectly...</i>

548
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:21,868
<i>How far will you...</i>

549
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:37,234
<i>There's no harm
in taking measures early.</i>

550
00:45:44,266 --> 00:45:46,433
W-What's that?!

551
00:45:49,814 --> 00:45:53,083
<i>He's starting
the Infinite Tsukuyomi already?!</i>

552
00:46:39,637 --> 00:46:41,806
I'll suspend the barrier for now.

553
00:47:13,213 --> 00:47:14,906
<i>Th-This is—!</i>

554
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:26,218
What?!

555
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:37,020
Run! It will absorb all your chakra
in one swoop!

556
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:44,862
It's coming after us one by one!

557
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,738
But why...?!

558
00:47:50,459 --> 00:47:55,797
Why...?! Why do I get so many
coming at me, huh?

559
00:47:55,931 --> 00:47:57,891
Fool...Ya fool!

560
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:01,712
<i>This is the tree of God.
It's called the Divine Tree!</i>

561
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:03,922
<i>It's the Ten-Tails' final form!</i>

562
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:08,844
<i>It knows that you have
more chakra than everyone else!</i>

563
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:13,765
<i>At this rate, the chakra that Naruto gave
to everyone is meaningless.</i>

564
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:20,314
W-What is this?!

565
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:23,167
Chakra first originated with...

566
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,402
this Divine Tree!

567
00:48:25,985 --> 00:48:27,862
All the chakra here...

568
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:31,309
Even the enormous amounts
of chakra you possess.

569
00:48:31,892 --> 00:48:33,060
What?

570
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:36,371
Humans stole chakra from
the Divine Tree long ago.

571
00:48:36,988 --> 00:48:40,116
It's just trying to take back
what belongs to it.

572
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:41,835
What are you talking about?!

573
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:47,382
The endless passing of time
has cast a fog over the truth.

574
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:52,479
Do you know how shinobi
came to be, Hashirama?

575
00:48:54,522 --> 00:48:59,748
Long ago, when people didn't
even have a concept of chakra...

576
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:06,443
...even then, people still battled
each other.

577
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:11,698
The Divine Tree was never involved
in their battles

578
00:49:12,123 --> 00:49:16,761
and was worshipped as
a sacred pillar.

579
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:19,539
But one day...

580
00:49:22,158 --> 00:49:24,535
The Divine Tree bore a fruit
that was said to be produced

581
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,019
only once in a millennium.

582
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:30,425
I don't know what it signified,
but legend dictated

583
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:33,161
that no one was to ever
lay hands on the fruit.

584
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:39,843
But one princess, in her desire

585
00:49:39,868 --> 00:49:44,048
to reap the power of
the Divine Tree to win a war,

586
00:49:44,306 --> 00:49:46,108
took and consumed the forbidden fruit.

587
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:50,404
Afterwards, she gained
the power of a god,

588
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:53,532
and it was said she quashed
the war by herself.

589
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:58,954
Her name was Kaguya Otsutsuki.

590
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,332
She was the first human
to have chakra.

591
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:06,878
Eventually, Kaguya would bear a child

592
00:50:06,903 --> 00:50:10,531
who was born with chakra
already within him.

593
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:15,303
However, the Divine Tree
came alive

594
00:50:15,328 --> 00:50:18,373
and went on a rampage
in order to reclaim its stolen chakra.

595
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:21,018
That is the Ten-Tails.

596
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:26,273
And the one who stopped it
was Kaguya's child.

597
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:29,443
His name was Hagoromo Otsutsuki.

598
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:33,905
He was the one who preached
the teachings of chakra,

599
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:35,890
and was the founder of Ninshu.

600
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:37,784
He was the forefather of the shinobi—

601
00:50:37,809 --> 00:50:39,769
The man known as
the Sage of Six Paths.

602
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:44,165
How do you know all of this?!

603
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:48,045
It was inscribed on
the Uchiha Stone Tablet.

604
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:54,258
Do I need to explain what happened

605
00:50:54,283 --> 00:50:57,332
to those who tasted of
the forbidden fruit...

606
00:50:58,045 --> 00:50:59,723
for the purpose of ending all conflict?

607
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:06,438
That's right...
It didn't change anything.

608
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:10,275
In fact, subsequent wars
become more gruesome!

609
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:14,821
Upon learning this,
I fell into despair.

610
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:19,385
There are no such things as true dreams
in this world, Hashirama!

611
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:24,831
Ever since people tasted that fruit,
humans have been cursed...

612
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:27,959
And destined to hate
each other even more!

613
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:32,088
And it is we shinobi
whose very existence

614
00:51:32,113 --> 00:51:35,200
symbolizes that foolishness,
don't you think?

615
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,386
In which case I'd rather...

616
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:41,556
So relying on the power
of the Divine Tree again

617
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,157
by using a great genjutsu...

618
00:51:46,477 --> 00:51:47,687
Naruto!

619
00:51:49,647 --> 00:51:51,650
<i>Water Style: Severing Wave!</i>

620
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,075
Damn it! There are too many of them!

621
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:03,120
<i>I might be able to sense Naruto,
but it's useless!</i>

622
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:06,706
Fourth! Can you teleport directly
to Naruto?!

623
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:12,420
I can't! That last Flying Raijin
and these vines have drained my chakra!

624
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,714
In that case...

625
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:23,265
Let go...of me...

626
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:31,273
<i>Gramps...</i>

627
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,011
Sorry it took so long!

628
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:37,964
Oh!

629
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:39,447
Saru!

630
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:42,701
All right!

631
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:44,286
We're teleporting out of here!

632
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:53,745
Have things finally settled down?

633
00:53:47,673 --> 00:53:51,177
Is this what you meant by
"dreams of the far future"?!

634
00:53:52,053 --> 00:53:52,812
Yes...

635
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,607
But it will be a little different.

636
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:57,859
"A little different"?

637
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:11,039
When the Divine Tree's bud
finally blooms...

638
00:54:12,248 --> 00:54:14,926
The moon will reflect the eye
at the flower's center, up above...

639
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,878
and the Infinite Tsukuyomi
will be fully activated...

640
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:24,160
And I...will be the one
to accomplish it.

641
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:27,013
We're doomed!

642
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:29,057
This is crazy...

643
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:31,643
Miss Sakura!

644
00:54:32,067 --> 00:54:33,836
Are you all right, Miss Sakura?

645
00:54:39,642 --> 00:54:43,229
That was a close call, fool! Ya fool!

646
00:54:44,105 --> 00:54:45,515
That was too close!

647
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:50,787
Is it over?

648
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:13,059
Now, be still...

649
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:18,825
You have all...

650
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:21,776
endured plenty already.

651
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:34,706
W-What is that?

652
00:55:35,814 --> 00:55:36,815
Katsuyu!

653
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,001
Yes, ma'am!

654
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:39,793
I shall explain everything!

655
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:43,798
Are you all right, Sakura...?

656
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:45,008
Yeah...

657
00:55:45,166 --> 00:55:46,985
The Five Kage will
be here shortly.

658
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,011
Shikamaru!

659
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:49,429
Shikamaru!

660
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:51,865
Hey!

661
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,309
Hey, he looks real bad!

662
00:55:54,575 --> 00:55:55,576
Lady Katsuyu!

663
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,520
Let's begin Distance Healing
immediately!

664
00:55:58,037 --> 00:55:59,196
That's not possible.

665
00:56:00,164 --> 00:56:01,165
Why?!

666
00:56:02,024 --> 00:56:06,154
Even my mini fragments attached
to everyone have been drained...

667
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:08,948
They have lost their chakra
and died.

668
00:56:10,057 --> 00:56:11,058
That's...

669
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:12,577
In other words...

670
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:15,305
Everyone is in the same state
as my fragments.

671
00:56:19,208 --> 00:56:21,961
<i>Sorry, Dad...</i>

672
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:26,216
<i>Looks like I'll be right
on your heels...</i>

673
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:27,550
Shikamaru!

674
00:56:28,251 --> 00:56:30,502
<i>Sorry...Mom...</i>

675
00:56:31,145 --> 00:56:31,821
Shikamaru!

676
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:32,806
Sakura!

677
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,774
Shinobi are done for.

678
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,360
There's no need to keep going.

679
00:56:46,961 --> 00:56:49,172
If you don't resist, I won't kill you.

680
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,663
Unless you want to
be filled with regret,

681
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,581
stop and do nothing
from here on out.

682
00:57:01,492 --> 00:57:04,787
If we don't do anything,
we'll be saved...?

683
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:06,079
Yes...

684
00:57:06,438 --> 00:57:09,066
You don't have to fear death
or keep enduring anymore.

685
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:10,969
You'll be entering a dream.

686
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:21,020
Do not give up!

687
00:57:22,013 --> 00:57:24,974
If you succumb to a genjutsu,
you're no different from being dead!

688
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:32,867
This giant tree is closely
connected to Obito...

689
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:36,119
They're like limbs
that suck out chakra.

690
00:57:36,285 --> 00:57:38,496
We can't approach carelessly.

691
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:40,582
Such words of weakness.

692
00:57:41,299 --> 00:57:42,741
So very unlike you.

693
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,379
Sarutobi Sensei...

694
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:48,131
Orochimaru...

695
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,592
You're late...

696
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:52,385
What of the Five Kage?

697
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,512
I had them healed.

698
00:57:54,845 --> 00:57:58,098
So as long as they don't chicken out,
they should be coming.

699
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:01,644
As sarcastic as ever, I see.

700
00:58:03,729 --> 00:58:05,814
Sorry I'm late, Jugo! Sasuke!

701
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:07,525
You're here...

702
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:16,743
This tree is huge
now that I see it up close.

703
00:58:17,284 --> 00:58:20,579
I wonder how long
it'll take to cut down?

704
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:23,215
<i>What's going on?</i>

705
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:28,587
<i>When that bud blooms,
Infinite Tsukuyomi will be complete.</i>

706
00:58:28,612 --> 00:58:30,072
<i>That's what Madara said.</i>

707
00:58:30,456 --> 00:58:34,377
<i>And yet, after depleting
the chakra of this many shinobi...</i>

708
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,804
<i>the bud shows no signs of blooming.</i>

709
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:40,725
So when is it going to bloom?

710
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,856
The Eight and Nine-Tails still live.

711
00:58:47,472 --> 00:58:50,934
However, if it contains even a small
amount of each of their chakra,

712
00:58:50,959 --> 00:58:52,044
it's fine.

713
00:58:53,061 --> 00:58:56,773
In other words,
it's not like it can't bloom.

714
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:02,123
All that is affected is how
long it will take to bloom.

715
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:05,548
There's about 15 minutes to go.

716
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:09,082
In that time, I shall stop Obito
and switch places with him.

717
00:59:09,745 --> 00:59:12,748
Using your Sage Power.

718
00:59:16,502 --> 00:59:17,628
<i>This is bad.</i>

719
00:59:18,145 --> 00:59:22,525
<i>Everything my original just heard
must be relayed to the Allied Force.</i>

720
00:59:24,427 --> 00:59:26,638
Anyone here belong to
the Yamanaka Clan?!

721
00:59:27,889 --> 00:59:28,890
Here!

722
00:59:28,915 --> 00:59:30,750
Can you do
the Mind Transmission Jutsu?!

723
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:32,735
Yes, I can, sir!

724
00:59:33,136 --> 00:59:35,388
Good! Please link me
to everyone here!

725
00:59:36,221 --> 00:59:38,424
There are things I'd like to explain
about that giant tree,

726
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:39,951
and the Infinite Tsukuyomi!

727
00:59:42,395 --> 00:59:43,396
<i>This sensation...</i>

728
00:59:46,357 --> 00:59:47,358
<i>Grandfather!</i>

729
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:49,493
<i>Ah! Is that you, Tsuna?</i>

730
00:59:50,544 --> 00:59:53,740
<i>This voice is unmistakably
Lord Hashirama's!</i>

731
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:58,052
<i>This means the Five Kage
are close enough</i>

732
00:59:58,077 --> 01:00:00,538
<i>to be within range of my jutsu!</i>

733
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:04,517
<i>Oops! We'll have to
reminisce later!</i>

734
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:08,313
<i>I have things I must relay
to you five and everyone else!</i>

735
01:00:08,838 --> 01:00:10,298
<i>Listen to me carefully!</i>

736
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:14,444
I'll retrieve a little more chakra.

737
01:00:14,952 --> 01:00:17,206
<i>It's taking too long for it to bloom.</i>

738
01:00:19,281 --> 01:00:22,784
<i>So we're just nourishment
for that tree?</i>

739
01:00:24,145 --> 01:00:26,662
<i>That's what shinobi are?!</i>

740
01:00:27,173 --> 01:00:29,216
<i>Then...how are we supposed to fight it?</i>

741
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:33,087
<i>If there's only 15 minutes left,
it's crazy!</i>

742
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:34,922
<i>We can't even get close to it!</i>

743
01:00:36,015 --> 01:00:38,601
<i>And yet, doing nothing will
yield the same result.</i>

744
01:00:39,744 --> 01:00:41,996
<i>We must either cut down that tree or</i>

745
01:00:42,146 --> 01:00:43,856
<i>defeat the caster within
the remaining time.</i>

746
01:00:44,607 --> 01:00:45,608
<i>But...</i>

747
01:00:47,176 --> 01:00:49,428
<i>I told you not to give up hope!</i>

748
01:00:49,938 --> 01:00:51,354
<i>That's what you say...</i>

749
01:00:51,379 --> 01:00:53,548
<i>But you're a reanimated person
from the past!</i>

750
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:55,777
<i>Brought back to life!</i>

751
01:00:56,093 --> 01:00:57,511
<i>We're still alive!</i>

752
01:01:02,892 --> 01:01:04,018
<i>It's all...over...</i>

753
01:01:04,693 --> 01:01:05,903
<i>If it's going to end like this,</i>

754
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:07,705
<i>we shouldn't have gotten
started at all...</i>

755
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:14,962
That's right. Just stay like that.

756
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:18,257
I'll take you to a world where
there are no regrets.

757
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:31,318
Naruto, are you done?

758
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:32,980
Because I'm not.

759
01:01:40,738 --> 01:01:41,906
Let's go, Jugo.

760
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:43,116
Yeah...

761
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:51,833
<i>These are...</i>

762
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:55,837
<i>I can feel them,
these are Naruto's feelings...</i>

763
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:57,839
<i>coming through my jutsu.</i>

764
01:02:24,598 --> 01:02:25,599
<i>I...</i>

765
01:02:32,623 --> 01:02:34,834
<i>I don't want to regret anything.</i>

766
01:02:39,046 --> 01:02:41,424
<i>I never want to think,
"I should have..."!</i>

767
01:02:42,350 --> 01:02:43,351
Naruto...

768
01:02:55,129 --> 01:02:56,180
<i>And...</i>

769
01:02:57,356 --> 01:02:59,901
<i>I just can't make
everything we've done...</i>

770
01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:06,591
up to this point meaningless!

771
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:08,117
Sasuke!

772
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:09,494
I'm coming too!

773
01:03:16,642 --> 01:03:17,893
Naruto Uzumaki...

774
01:03:18,885 --> 01:03:20,554
<i>Time and time again...</i>

775
01:03:33,367 --> 01:03:36,871
<i>Sorry to have to borrow
more chakra.</i>

776
01:03:37,104 --> 01:03:38,481
<i>No worries!</i>

777
01:03:39,131 --> 01:03:40,424
<i>Naruto, we're counting on you!</i>

778
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,721
Hey, Sasuke...

779
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:49,717
You realize that only Sage Jutsu
works on him, right?!

780
01:03:50,267 --> 01:03:52,853
Don't compare me to you.

781
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:06,509
Look, Karin...

782
01:04:06,734 --> 01:04:09,420
Isn't that...Sasuke's
Curse Mark patterning?

783
01:04:09,819 --> 01:04:11,863
The Curse Mark is supposed
to have lost its power...

784
01:04:12,806 --> 01:04:16,268
Sage Power is the source
of Jugo's Curse Mark.

785
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,329
And with Sasuke,

786
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:22,108
back when I experimented with
injecting Jugo's chakra into him,

787
01:04:22,133 --> 01:04:25,136
he immediately unleashed
the Curse Mark.

788
01:04:25,702 --> 01:04:28,711
So it's not surprising
for Sasuke's Susano'o

789
01:04:28,736 --> 01:04:32,573
to adapt to Jugo's chakra
in similar fashion.

790
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:36,831
In other words, you could call it
a Sage Jutsu Susano'o.

791
01:04:37,689 --> 01:04:39,149
<i>Sasuke Uchiha, huh?</i>

792
01:04:39,868 --> 01:04:42,370
<i>He shows the same potential
that Madara once did...</i>

793
01:04:42,694 --> 01:04:44,154
<i>You Uchiha...</i>

794
01:04:44,671 --> 01:04:45,356
Aim!

795
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:46,248
Gotcha!

796
01:04:46,273 --> 01:04:47,941
It'll be too late for regrets,
you know.

797
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:50,621
Not that there's going to be
a future for either of you.

798
01:04:57,126 --> 01:04:59,170
<i>I'm looking forward to
the battles we'll fight...</i>

799
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:02,940
<i>...up until the time I achieve
my true dream.</i>

800
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:05,067
<i>What is your true dream?</i>

801
01:05:05,526 --> 01:05:08,612
<i>I thought everything we've aimed for
is here in this village!</i>

802
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:11,240
<i>You just can't see it.</i>

803
01:05:12,015 --> 01:05:15,268
<i>What's even further ahead...
dreams of the far future.</i>

804
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,499
<i>Then tell me about your dreams
of the far future.</i>

805
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:22,893
<i>These are Lord First's memories?</i>

806
01:05:24,252 --> 01:05:25,837
<i>Dreams of the future...</i>

807
01:05:35,230 --> 01:05:39,273
The fact that we were able
to convene this Five Kage Summit

808
01:05:39,806 --> 01:05:41,446
with the first Kage of each
of the Five Nations...

809
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:43,056
truly fills me...

810
01:05:45,816 --> 01:05:47,026
...with gratitude!

811
01:05:47,785 --> 01:05:48,619
Elder Brother!

812
01:05:48,978 --> 01:05:51,439
You are the Hokage, representing
the Hidden Leaf of the Land of Fire!

813
01:05:51,597 --> 01:05:54,300
A person like you, need not bow
to the other Kage!

814
01:05:55,692 --> 01:05:57,452
But...I'm so happy!

815
01:05:57,870 --> 01:06:00,677
Lord Hokage, raise your head...

816
01:06:01,316 --> 01:06:05,394
That's not becoming of
a village leader...

817
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:12,318
I did indeed come here to endorse
the gist of Lord Hokage's pact,

818
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:14,845
but I'm not just signing
anything for free.

819
01:06:15,687 --> 01:06:20,108
If you behave too humbly,
you'll make us suspicious.

820
01:06:21,176 --> 01:06:24,246
Distributing the Tailed Beasts that
Lord Hokage has collected

821
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:25,594
to the other villages

822
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:28,150
is the condition of signing the treaty.

823
01:06:28,717 --> 01:06:32,179
This is a transaction,
not something to get emotional over.

824
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:36,751
Exactly, and we'll allocate
the Tailed Beasts based on power,

825
01:06:37,058 --> 01:06:38,894
but you will be acquiring them
for a price.

826
01:06:39,511 --> 01:06:40,221
Not for free?

827
01:06:40,646 --> 01:06:41,430
Shut up!

828
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:48,179
This was the very first summit!

829
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:52,700
Yes, and it was what would lead
to the end of minor conflicts.

830
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:06,138
In our village,
a certain temple's disciples

831
01:07:06,163 --> 01:07:09,833
have long been sealing away
a Tailed Beast.

832
01:07:09,858 --> 01:07:13,404
Since we already have one,
we do not need another.

833
01:07:14,763 --> 01:07:17,850
Instead, we would like
an alternative compensation

834
01:07:18,075 --> 01:07:20,077
for our collaboration in this pact.

835
01:07:20,335 --> 01:07:21,614
Would that be acceptable?

836
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:23,739
What do you desire?

837
01:07:24,398 --> 01:07:26,608
Our nation is completely
covered in sand.

838
01:07:27,267 --> 01:07:29,311
Thus, we'd like the adjoining Leaf

839
01:07:29,336 --> 01:07:32,464
to share arable land with us
instead of a Tailed Beast.

840
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:35,042
And the other nations to hand
over 30%

841
01:07:35,067 --> 01:07:38,029
of your Tailed Beast
purchase price as well.

842
01:07:38,537 --> 01:07:40,122
Don't mess around, Kazekage!

843
01:07:40,147 --> 01:07:40,898
What—?!

844
01:07:41,173 --> 01:07:42,883
You overstep your bounds,
Lord Kazekage!

845
01:07:43,517 --> 01:07:47,771
I won't sign on unless
all of you accept these terms!

846
01:07:48,422 --> 01:07:51,341
Mine is a desert-locked nation
with zero fertility!

847
01:07:51,475 --> 01:07:55,287
It's only natural to use my village's
Tailed Beast to full advantage

848
01:07:55,312 --> 01:07:58,315
in dealings with
the four other Great Nations!

849
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:00,367
We four nations could join up...

850
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:03,303
and defeat the Land of Wind...

851
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:14,632
It's true that we've never
gotten along in the past...

852
01:08:15,382 --> 01:08:19,546
But we each did what we did
to protect our brethren and clans.

853
01:08:20,379 --> 01:08:22,437
There were, perhaps,
times when we had no other choice.

854
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:27,262
And now, today, even if
our Five Nation Treaty comes to be...

855
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,672
I can't say how long it will last...

856
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:32,497
or if we can even hold to it.

857
01:08:34,059 --> 01:08:36,478
But I have this dream,

858
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:39,563
That sometime in the future...

859
01:08:39,588 --> 01:08:42,593
There will come a day when
shinobi will collaborate,

860
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:45,538
and help each other, with one heart,
regardless of their affiliation.

861
01:08:46,597 --> 01:08:48,599
That is my...

862
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,159
My dream of the future.

863
01:08:55,305 --> 01:08:59,017
I ask you to take the first step
toward that dream today!

864
01:08:59,943 --> 01:09:04,906
So please, please, please, please...

865
01:09:05,532 --> 01:09:06,700
I beg you!

866
01:09:06,725 --> 01:09:09,645
All of my, our beloved children!

867
01:09:10,754 --> 01:09:12,715
Now is the time to
take all the pain,

868
01:09:13,031 --> 01:09:16,886
the suffering, and frustration
we shinobi have endured...

869
01:09:17,511 --> 01:09:19,221
and weave it into

870
01:09:19,563 --> 01:09:21,482
Our true dream!

871
01:09:22,332 --> 01:09:28,130
Seems like our generation no longer
needs to talk about that dream.

872
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:30,291
Am I wrong?

873
01:09:30,916 --> 01:09:32,083
Indeed.

874
01:09:32,209 --> 01:09:33,669
That goes without saying.

875
01:09:34,628 --> 01:09:39,549
But if we don't win here,
it won't come to be!

876
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:44,138
Tsuchikage is right.
Defeat is not an option.

877
01:09:44,546 --> 01:09:45,589
All right!

878
01:09:45,697 --> 01:09:48,117
We'll spread out and take command...

879
01:09:48,475 --> 01:09:51,604
and draw out the ultimate power
from the Allied Forces!

880
01:09:52,254 --> 01:09:56,091
That is our primary duty
as the Five Kage!

881
01:09:56,984 --> 01:09:58,095
– Scatter!
– Scatter!

882
01:10:34,963 --> 01:10:35,839
Sasuke!

883
01:10:35,981 --> 01:10:37,107
I'll keep in sync with you!

884
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:06,445
You better be prepared...

885
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:18,232
This is...!

886
01:11:23,728 --> 01:11:28,842
<i>Damn it, Naruto...
You never change.</i>

887
01:11:29,909 --> 01:11:31,888
<i>You're always going overboard...</i>

888
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:36,208
<i>Sticking your neck out for us...
How far will you go...?</i>

889
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:42,774
<i>All this time, you've never held back
or compromised when it came to us.</i>

890
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:50,055
<i>In front of you, I can't complain about
what a drag things are...</i>

891
01:11:54,893 --> 01:11:57,730
Sorry, Dad...

892
01:11:58,605 --> 01:12:02,651
Naruto doesn't want me...
to join you just yet.

893
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:04,903
Shikamaru, stop talking!

894
01:12:05,736 --> 01:12:07,780
I‘m not letting you die!

895
01:12:08,782 --> 01:12:11,577
Naruto...rather, everybody needs you!

896
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:22,796
<i>Unlike Lord First, that dumb Naruto
doesn't have an adept brother...</i>

897
01:12:23,223 --> 01:12:25,174
<i>like Lord Second, to be his advisor.</i>

898
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:30,763
<i>That's why...even more so...</i>

899
01:12:31,888 --> 01:12:34,148
<i>I need to stick around so that
when he becomes the Hokage,</i>

900
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:37,767
<i>I can stand next to that idiot.</i>

901
01:12:41,364 --> 01:12:47,287
<i>So I'm sorry, Dad...
I can't join you just yet.</i>

902
01:12:49,072 --> 01:12:54,035
<i>There's no one more qualified than me
to be Naruto's advisor.</i>

903
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,294
<i>Naruto, thank you...</i>

904
01:13:02,894 --> 01:13:07,190
<i>Your chakra and the power
of your heart saved him!</i>

905
01:13:08,157 --> 01:13:09,993
Yes! He's rallied!

906
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:12,096
Thank you, Sakura.

907
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:15,349
<i>Thank you, Naruto.</i>

908
01:13:15,933 --> 01:13:17,768
Don't overdo it, Shikamaru.

909
01:13:17,851 --> 01:13:20,312
You just might become
my advisor instead!

910
01:13:22,956 --> 01:13:24,582
Don't worry, Akamaru.

911
01:13:25,134 --> 01:13:28,137
It's because a Kage can have
up to three advisors.

912
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:33,033
<i>I want to stay by Naruto too.</i>

913
01:13:33,342 --> 01:13:34,593
<i>I'll have to work hard!</i>

914
01:13:34,618 --> 01:13:36,078
Shikamaru!

915
01:13:43,293 --> 01:13:44,670
Lady Tsunade!

916
01:13:47,881 --> 01:13:49,300
You did well!

917
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:56,849
Forgive me, Grandfather.

918
01:13:57,683 --> 01:14:00,310
Tsuna, don't apologize.

919
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,982
I dragged this mess into
my grandchildren's era.

920
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:07,609
My cowardice is to blame...

921
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:11,613
But your heart and dreams have
also been passed down

922
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:16,535
even beyond your grandchildren's era...

923
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:18,770
Yes, your...

924
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,248
Will of Fire!

925
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:23,610
Hey!

926
01:14:26,844 --> 01:14:28,120
Why you...!

927
01:14:30,482 --> 01:14:31,558
All right!

928
01:14:31,583 --> 01:14:35,879
Let's cut down this giant tree while
he is distracted by his battle!

929
01:14:40,225 --> 01:14:43,061
No matter how large it may be,

930
01:14:43,627 --> 01:14:46,957
that tree is nothing compared
to this very earth!

931
01:14:47,883 --> 01:14:50,469
And the great earth,
this land is on our side!

932
01:14:51,403 --> 01:14:53,238
– Right!
– Right!

933
01:14:56,499 --> 01:14:58,043
<i>I'm begging you!</i>

934
01:14:58,118 --> 01:15:01,288
<i>I don't want us killing each other
out of vengeance anymore!</i>

935
01:15:02,005 --> 01:15:04,299
<i>A ninja does not bow
his head so easily!</i>

936
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:08,295
<i>A ninja values action and strength!</i>

937
01:15:12,966 --> 01:15:16,845
<i>It seems those who become Hokage
like prostrating themselves, but...</i>

938
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:20,390
<i>As an act that relays one's heart,</i>

939
01:15:20,582 --> 01:15:23,376
<i>perhaps it can lead to strength
and be meritorious too.</i>

940
01:15:24,735 --> 01:15:26,362
Let's go, everyone!

941
01:15:26,762 --> 01:15:30,266
Okay! Double lariat time, bro! Yeah!

942
01:15:30,792 --> 01:15:32,544
– Here we go!
– Here we go!

943
01:15:32,769 --> 01:15:36,481
As a woman, I mustn't get
a late start on battle...

944
01:15:37,174 --> 01:15:39,384
All right, everyone. Let's go!

945
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:41,713
– Right!
– Right!

946
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:52,798
Damn it!

947
01:16:02,349 --> 01:16:03,399
<i>Naruto...</i>

948
01:16:05,051 --> 01:16:09,472
<i>You have truly become a necessary
existence to this world...</i>

949
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:13,068
<i>What the two of us had
always wanted to be.</i>

950
01:16:13,234 --> 01:16:16,872
<i>And you will now save
the entire world, Naruto!</i>

951
01:16:17,547 --> 01:16:19,299
– Everyone, follow me!
– Everyone, follow me!

952
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:22,969
– Let's go!
– Let's go!

953
01:16:31,336 --> 01:16:34,298
<i>All right, I think I should
get going now.</i>

954
01:16:35,617 --> 01:16:40,496
The springtime of my youth…
hasn't ended yet!

955
01:16:40,947 --> 01:16:42,790
Let's go, Lee! Tenten!

956
01:16:43,307 --> 01:16:44,308
– Yes!
– Right!

957
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:48,186
<i>Your past is filtering into me
through the others.</i>

958
01:16:51,256 --> 01:16:55,385
<i>Naruto Uzumaki, you are uniting
everyone right now.</i>

959
01:16:56,028 --> 01:17:00,616
<i>Your tempestuous life made you
into who you are.</i>

960
01:17:01,558 --> 01:17:06,538
<i>And your way of life has given
everyone's hearts hope!</i>

961
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:10,792
Let us pursue hope! Onward!

962
01:17:15,213 --> 01:17:16,757
Let's do it!

963
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:18,608
Let's go!

964
01:17:27,793 --> 01:17:29,836
Let's cut down that giant tree!

965
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:35,776
We samurai must not waver either!

966
01:17:36,276 --> 01:17:37,611
Go forth!

967
01:17:40,822 --> 01:17:46,328
Fourth, I'm going to use the link
between your chakra and Naruto's.

968
01:17:47,454 --> 01:17:49,849
I can't move simultaneously like you,

969
01:17:50,415 --> 01:17:52,992
but I'll still help protect them
all with my Teleportation Jutsu.

970
01:17:54,586 --> 01:17:55,879
Orochimaru...

971
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:59,591
Are you just going to spectate?

972
01:18:00,667 --> 01:18:03,920
I have no interest in this war.

973
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:12,020
However, this dream of Obito's would
lead to the elimination of this,

974
01:18:12,045 --> 01:18:15,048
my precious laboratory...

975
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:18,151
So I suppose I cannot support it.

976
01:18:19,352 --> 01:18:21,312
Then lend me a hand.

977
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:25,659
Fine then.

978
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:29,496
I'll partake in a bit of nostalgia...

979
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:34,376
and participate in some
student and teacher teamwork!

980
01:18:36,811 --> 01:18:39,073
<i>I'll shift to a more offensive form!</i>

981
01:18:43,142 --> 01:18:44,143
What is it?!

982
01:18:44,168 --> 01:18:45,085
Do not panic!

983
01:18:45,112 --> 01:18:46,113
It's coming!

984
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:51,393
Huh?!

985
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:52,335
What?

986
01:18:53,895 --> 01:18:57,524
<i>I'll use my Teleportation Jutsu
to whisk anyone in danger away.</i>

987
01:18:57,607 --> 01:18:58,817
<i>So go forth without fear!</i>

988
01:18:59,109 --> 01:19:00,652
It's the voice of Lord Second!

989
01:19:01,027 --> 01:19:04,281
We can give it our all.
It's because...

990
01:19:04,306 --> 01:19:06,308
Still, don't get careless!

991
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:09,870
With two 100 Healings adepts,
we can likely summon

992
01:19:10,186 --> 01:19:13,699
one-tenth of Katsuyu's actual body here
from Shikkotsu Woods!

993
01:19:14,507 --> 01:19:16,968
We'll mold Katsuyu into
the Allied Force's entire footing,

994
01:19:17,301 --> 01:19:20,664
into a Healing Area where one can
be restored just by standing on her.

995
01:19:21,607 --> 01:19:22,733
Ready, Sakura?

996
01:19:23,224 --> 01:19:23,825
Yes!

997
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,037
– <i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>
– <i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

998
01:19:31,783 --> 01:19:33,744
Ino! Have you relayed that to everyone?

999
01:19:34,019 --> 01:19:34,661
Yes!

1000
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:41,651
Huh? What's that going to do?

1001
01:19:41,651 --> 01:19:42,569
Is this it?!

1002
01:19:42,663 --> 01:19:45,781
This way, we can fight without
our chakra being stolen!

1003
01:19:45,806 --> 01:19:47,725
Oh, this is great!

1004
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:49,669
So this is the Healing Area?!

1005
01:19:49,776 --> 01:19:52,237
If you understand,
quit playing around and get going!

1006
01:19:59,278 --> 01:20:00,104
<i>Damn it!</i>

1007
01:20:00,245 --> 01:20:01,330
<i>He really is fast...!</i>

1008
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:03,223
<i>But...</i>

1009
01:20:04,133 --> 01:20:06,302
<i>I'm starting to sense him
better and better!</i>

1010
01:20:08,244 --> 01:20:09,179
– <i>Right there!</i>
– <i>Right there!</i>

1011
01:20:17,787 --> 01:20:20,373
It's about time that you go to sleep.

1012
01:21:04,401 --> 01:21:05,819
Why do you get up?!

1013
01:21:07,855 --> 01:21:10,649
And what are you fighting for?

1014
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:15,662
Is it for your comrades?
Or is it for this world?

1015
01:21:21,884 --> 01:21:26,180
Listen, friends will eventually betray you.

1016
01:21:27,857 --> 01:21:31,656
And this world transforms love
into hatred.

1017
01:21:32,628 --> 01:21:34,539
You should know!

1018
01:21:36,666 --> 01:21:40,712
In the past, the people of the village
and Sasuke betrayed you.

1019
01:21:43,264 --> 01:21:47,566
And your love for Jiraiya
made you hate.

1020
01:21:52,382 --> 01:21:54,259
You and I are the same.

1021
01:21:56,119 --> 01:22:00,123
The cumulative weight of all
your suffering will change you in time.

1022
01:22:00,624 --> 01:22:04,836
And now, even more pain
shall assault you.

1023
01:22:06,295 --> 01:22:10,299
And you still insist that
you will not change?!

1024
01:22:11,868 --> 01:22:15,413
You don't know when your friends
will betray you again...

1025
01:22:16,205 --> 01:22:19,333
Or if the Allied Forces might
go back to fighting each other.

1026
01:22:20,026 --> 01:22:23,696
And you don't even know
if you can defeat me!

1027
01:22:24,397 --> 01:22:28,610
There is no reason to keep on
fighting for a world like this.

1028
01:22:31,563 --> 01:22:35,075
In a few minutes,
this world will be gone anyway.

1029
01:22:37,635 --> 01:22:40,055
Why do you still fight?

1030
01:22:42,248 --> 01:22:45,752
Because it's my ninja way.

1031
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:52,759
I never go back on my word.

1032
01:22:53,176 --> 01:22:55,860
That's my ninja way.

1033
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:07,315
I thought I told you to go to sleep!

1034
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:15,532
Let's settle this with
our next move, Naruto!

1035
01:23:15,899 --> 01:23:16,617
Right!

1036
01:23:28,661 --> 01:23:32,790
We'll sleep tomorrow,
dreaming our own dreams!

1037
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:41,382
<i>The Susano'o is...</i>

1038
01:23:57,866 --> 01:23:58,867
That's...

1039
01:24:01,202 --> 01:24:04,289
I believe this is what
Madara did once before.

1040
01:24:39,374 --> 01:24:41,918
<i>This is...Naruto and Sasuke?</i>

1041
01:25:10,221 --> 01:25:12,640
Nothing you try now
will change anything.

1042
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:15,318
Look above you...

1043
01:25:16,027 --> 01:25:18,279
What can you see through
that hole at the top?

1044
01:25:19,563 --> 01:25:21,232
<i>I can see what Obito sees...</i>

1045
01:25:21,866 --> 01:25:23,201
<i>and hear his voice.</i>

1046
01:25:24,343 --> 01:25:25,427
<i>It's resonating.</i>

1047
01:25:26,687 --> 01:25:27,855
The moon.

1048
01:25:28,414 --> 01:25:31,543
The time to enter
the moonlit dream world nears.

1049
01:25:32,902 --> 01:25:37,040
The gaping hole of hell that has opened
will be filled by the moon's dreams...

1050
01:25:38,424 --> 01:25:40,468
That time is finally here!

1051
01:25:43,821 --> 01:25:46,324
This sword is the divine blade
of the Sage of the Six Paths...

1052
01:25:46,349 --> 01:25:47,809
the Nunoboko.

1053
01:25:49,135 --> 01:25:51,303
You can no longer defeat me.

1054
01:25:52,605 --> 01:25:54,691
Strong emotions dwell within the blade.

1055
01:25:55,349 --> 01:25:56,516
It's a sword of the soul.

1056
01:25:57,485 --> 01:26:00,446
The Sage created the world
with this blade.

1057
01:26:03,942 --> 01:26:06,653
Hey...did you feel that...just now?

1058
01:26:06,911 --> 01:26:07,912
Yeah...

1059
01:26:07,937 --> 01:26:09,689
Tenten, isn't this...?

1060
01:26:09,714 --> 01:26:11,508
Yeah. Let's go, Lee!

1061
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:13,918
He's calling us.

1062
01:26:15,578 --> 01:26:17,622
Let's focus everything on
a single blow.

1063
01:26:18,297 --> 01:26:20,424
I think we're only gonna have
a tiny window to strike.

1064
01:26:20,758 --> 01:26:21,759
Don't miss it.

1065
01:26:34,063 --> 01:26:37,525
And I will use this sword
to obliterate this world!

1066
01:26:44,365 --> 01:26:45,366
<i>Obito...</i>

1067
01:26:47,434 --> 01:26:49,679
<i>Even if it's someone
they used to make fun of...</i>

1068
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:52,991
<i>when people see someone
trying twice as hard as others,</i>

1069
01:26:53,525 --> 01:26:55,966
<i>they instinctively start wanting
to lend a hand.</i>

1070
01:26:56,761 --> 01:26:57,970
<i>That's because...</i>

1071
01:26:58,755 --> 01:27:02,091
<i>people eventually learn
that they only have each other</i>

1072
01:27:02,275 --> 01:27:04,159
<i>to fill the holes in their hearts.</i>

1073
01:27:10,808 --> 01:27:12,977
<i>I'm giving a Rasengan
to each of you!</i>

1074
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:15,804
<i>Use it to blast through his shield!</i>

1075
01:27:16,613 --> 01:27:17,614
<i>This, right?</i>

1076
01:27:19,442 --> 01:27:21,069
<i>Can I really do this?</i>

1077
01:27:21,736 --> 01:27:22,737
<i>You can!</i>

1078
01:27:24,656 --> 01:27:28,694
<i>And he who possesses
a heart filled with comrades...</i>

1079
01:27:36,634 --> 01:27:37,802
<i>is truly powerful!</i>

1080
01:27:45,710 --> 01:27:47,546
<i>Go get him, everyone!</i>

1081
01:29:23,148 --> 01:29:24,650
<i>Why am I...</i>

1082
01:29:25,576 --> 01:29:26,952
<i>seeing such images...?</i>

1083
01:29:50,143 --> 01:29:51,853
<i>Just like we thought!</i>

1084
01:29:52,186 --> 01:29:54,447
<i>The chakra you received
from the Tailed Beasts earlier</i>

1085
01:29:54,472 --> 01:29:56,949
<i>reacted to the Tailed Beast chakra
inside him and</i>

1086
01:29:56,974 --> 01:29:58,851
<i>you were able to pull it all out
in one shot!</i>

1087
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:00,061
Yeah!

1088
01:30:00,386 --> 01:30:02,754
<i>This wouldn't have worked</i>

1089
01:30:02,779 --> 01:30:05,083
<i>if the Tailed Beasts hadn't taken a liking
to you back then</i>

1090
01:30:05,108 --> 01:30:06,776
<i>and shared their chakra with you.</i>

1091
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:08,093
Now!

1092
01:30:21,715 --> 01:30:24,134
<i>You know what to do next, right, Naruto?</i>

1093
01:30:24,751 --> 01:30:25,961
<i>It's a tug-of-war!</i>

1094
01:30:26,663 --> 01:30:29,272
<i>Just pull the Tailed Beasts' chakra
right out of him!</i>

1095
01:30:29,873 --> 01:30:30,874
Yeah!

1096
01:30:33,168 --> 01:30:33,794
<i>Damn!</i>

1097
01:30:33,986 --> 01:30:36,030
<i>I guess it won't work with One Tail
and Eight-Tails</i>

1098
01:30:36,055 --> 01:30:37,298
<i>because we never got their chakra.</i>

1099
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:39,817
One Tail used to be linked to me.

1100
01:30:40,017 --> 01:30:41,227
I'll get him.

1101
01:30:41,444 --> 01:30:42,228
Gaara!

1102
01:30:45,898 --> 01:30:48,192
<i>Come here, Shukaku!</i>

1103
01:30:49,193 --> 01:30:51,213
We finally found a weakness,
that's the key!

1104
01:30:51,238 --> 01:30:53,540
You can leave Eight-o's chakra to me!

1105
01:30:58,436 --> 01:30:59,486
Octopops!

1106
01:31:00,054 --> 01:31:02,598
<i>Let's do this, Bee! Don't lose!</i>

1107
01:31:19,156 --> 01:31:20,199
<i>Extract them!</i>

1108
01:31:20,683 --> 01:31:24,145
<i>Then the only power he'll have left
is the Ten-Tails' shell!</i>

1109
01:31:24,512 --> 01:31:26,681
<i>And the Divine Tree's bud
will not bloom!</i>

1110
01:31:41,195 --> 01:31:42,196
They've stopped...

1111
01:31:43,272 --> 01:31:44,273
<i>Which means...</i>

1112
01:31:44,582 --> 01:31:48,002
<i>he's lost control of the Divine Tree!</i>

1113
01:31:48,628 --> 01:31:49,404
<i>In other words...</i>

1114
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:39,637
<i>It's because your chakra
is connected to his!</i>

1115
01:32:39,978 --> 01:32:42,564
<i>His feelings will flow into you,
but don't let them distract you!</i>

1116
01:32:42,974 --> 01:32:46,527
Don't underestimate
the power of the Ten-Tails' Jinchuriki.

1117
01:32:46,552 --> 01:32:48,045
I'm equivalent to
the Sage of the Six Paths!

1118
01:32:59,824 --> 01:33:01,576
Just keep pulling, Naruto.

1119
01:33:07,181 --> 01:33:09,851
Naruto! You're the one
who asked us to lend a hand!

1120
01:33:09,992 --> 01:33:12,244
So we're helping out until the very end!

1121
01:33:12,712 --> 01:33:13,529
Guys!

1122
01:33:14,505 --> 01:33:15,923
And that's not all...

1123
01:33:24,724 --> 01:33:27,519
Everyone! Grab onto my chakra!

1124
01:33:37,044 --> 01:33:38,087
This one?

1125
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:39,689
All right!

1126
01:33:39,890 --> 01:33:42,889
Everyone, we'll do it together
on my mark!

1127
01:33:44,676 --> 01:33:46,078
Pull!

1128
01:34:34,344 --> 01:34:35,553
<i>Are you saying…</i>

1129
01:34:39,507 --> 01:34:41,217
<i>That I…</i>

1130
01:34:42,009 --> 01:34:44,345
<i>I've got regrets...?!</i>

1131
01:34:50,334 --> 01:34:51,669
You once told me...

1132
01:34:52,269 --> 01:34:53,437
"I'm nobody..

1133
01:34:53,871 --> 01:34:55,956
"I don't want to be anybody..."

1134
01:34:55,981 --> 01:34:59,193
Stop! Don't come into my thoughts!

1135
01:35:03,572 --> 01:35:05,282
But the truth is...

1136
01:35:05,899 --> 01:35:08,568
You wanted to become the Hokage,
just like me.

1137
01:35:09,912 --> 01:35:16,377
It could have even ended up where
I was chasing after your shadow...

1138
01:35:17,336 --> 01:35:19,789
since I've always wanted
to become the Hokage.

1139
01:35:20,172 --> 01:35:23,008
I threw away the past
and my naïve self!

1140
01:35:23,341 --> 01:35:24,151
So don't tell me I'm—

1141
01:35:24,176 --> 01:35:26,129
Then why am I able to see this?

1142
01:35:27,430 --> 01:35:29,974
You can't hide behind a mask.

1143
01:35:31,267 --> 01:35:34,311
You were Kakashi Sensei's friend...

1144
01:35:34,745 --> 01:35:38,449
my dad's subordinate...
an Uchiha like Sasuke...

1145
01:35:39,592 --> 01:35:44,163
and a shinobi of the Hidden Leaf
who had the same dream as me.

1146
01:35:44,488 --> 01:35:46,632
What...What exactly...

1147
01:35:47,826 --> 01:35:49,535
do you want with me?!

1148
01:35:50,619 --> 01:35:53,457
To remind you that
you are Obito Uchiha.

1149
01:35:58,360 --> 01:35:59,695
I told you, didn't I?

1150
01:35:59,869 --> 01:36:02,664
I swore I'd tear that mask
right off your face!

1151
01:36:03,674 --> 01:36:05,383
Obito Uchiha?

1152
01:36:06,526 --> 01:36:08,277
What meaning is there
in that name...

1153
01:36:08,929 --> 01:36:10,885
in that existence, now?

1154
01:36:11,932 --> 01:36:13,726
I have merged with Ten-Tails.

1155
01:36:14,476 --> 01:36:17,395
I have transcended and
attained enlightenment.

1156
01:36:18,355 --> 01:36:21,358
I am no longer human.

1157
01:36:21,776 --> 01:36:24,737
I will guide mankind to
the next stage.

1158
01:36:25,654 --> 01:36:29,074
I possess the same will and body
as the Sage of Six Paths.

1159
01:36:29,549 --> 01:36:31,426
I am the Second Sage
of the Six Paths!

1160
01:36:31,827 --> 01:36:35,039
Wrong! You are Obito Uchiha!

1161
01:36:36,373 --> 01:36:40,044
When our chakra touched earlier,
I saw your past.

1162
01:36:40,653 --> 01:36:42,839
Our personal histories and

1163
01:36:43,271 --> 01:36:44,806
our dream of becoming Hokage
are the same.

1164
01:36:45,740 --> 01:36:47,242
Almost exactly alike.

1165
01:36:48,677 --> 01:36:50,438
Neither of us knew our parents.

1166
01:36:51,037 --> 01:36:54,332
And we both lost people
precious to us.

1167
01:36:55,017 --> 01:36:56,668
Which is why you tried
to scare me

1168
01:36:56,693 --> 01:36:58,963
by saying solitude is
my worst nightmare.

1169
01:37:00,689 --> 01:37:01,857
In the beginning,

1170
01:37:01,882 --> 01:37:04,927
you too wanted to be acknowledged
and praised by others!

1171
01:37:05,394 --> 01:37:08,689
That's why you wanted
to be Hokage...

1172
01:37:09,698 --> 01:37:11,075
If you're the same as me, that is!

1173
01:37:16,655 --> 01:37:18,949
But look at you now!

1174
01:37:19,416 --> 01:37:21,478
You've turned all shinobi
into enemies

1175
01:37:21,911 --> 01:37:23,212
and you go spouting
some nonsense

1176
01:37:23,237 --> 01:37:25,130
that you're doing it for
the sake of the world...

1177
01:37:25,155 --> 01:37:27,449
when you're only doing it
for yourself!

1178
01:37:29,009 --> 01:37:30,261
No one...

1179
01:37:31,078 --> 01:37:32,955
not even those precious to you

1180
01:37:33,097 --> 01:37:35,975
would ever acknowledge
this current dream of yours.

1181
01:37:39,019 --> 01:37:41,355
You used to have
the same dream as me.

1182
01:37:41,897 --> 01:37:43,766
But now you've become
the exact opposite of a Hokage!

1183
01:37:44,507 --> 01:37:46,175
It's because you're just
like me that...

1184
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:48,536
No, it's because of that...

1185
01:37:49,755 --> 01:37:53,759
That I wanted to see you despair
about this world.

1186
01:37:56,536 --> 01:38:00,248
Or...I suppose I wanted
to feel again for myself,

1187
01:38:00,924 --> 01:38:04,594
that the path I have chosen
for myself is not a mistake.

1188
01:38:06,838 --> 01:38:11,593
When I was fighting you,
you made me recall my youth.

1189
01:38:12,411 --> 01:38:14,413
That's why I started wanting
to test you.

1190
01:38:15,898 --> 01:38:17,649
To see when you,
someone who's just like me,

1191
01:38:17,850 --> 01:38:19,476
would fall to despair...

1192
01:38:20,837 --> 01:38:23,264
and abandon your feelings, your past.

1193
01:38:23,289 --> 01:38:26,459
It's because we were so alike
that I'm pissed off!

1194
01:38:27,067 --> 01:38:32,281
You're just...abandoning everything
and running away!

1195
01:38:33,490 --> 01:38:34,274
No...

1196
01:38:35,291 --> 01:38:38,586
What I'm doing is no different
from a Hokage's actions.

1197
01:38:39,329 --> 01:38:40,655
In fact, I'm doing even more...

1198
01:38:41,957 --> 01:38:44,585
I can make peace a reality.

1199
01:38:45,777 --> 01:38:49,387
Are you really serious?

1200
01:38:52,650 --> 01:38:55,195
Do you really believe that?

1201
01:39:07,624 --> 01:39:10,127
You know, Rin, you saving me...

1202
01:39:10,359 --> 01:39:14,731
is really the same as
you saving the world.

1203
01:39:15,074 --> 01:39:16,075
Hmm?

1204
01:39:16,408 --> 01:39:17,826
I mean...

1205
01:39:18,035 --> 01:39:21,830
It's because I'm gonna become
the Hokage and end this war!

1206
01:39:22,790 --> 01:39:23,691
For me to do that,

1207
01:39:23,716 --> 01:39:25,941
I have to stay strong and
healthy in this world.

1208
01:39:30,071 --> 01:39:31,448
You get what I'm saying?

1209
01:39:32,115 --> 01:39:34,785
Yeah! Though you're not
making much sense...

1210
01:39:35,693 --> 01:39:38,320
So...how do I put it...?

1211
01:39:39,622 --> 01:39:43,626
If you don't stay close
and keep an eye on me...

1212
01:39:45,396 --> 01:39:46,480
I mean...

1213
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:49,400
Well...

1214
01:39:54,737 --> 01:39:57,240
Yes...That's how I feel.

1215
01:39:58,902 --> 01:40:02,221
There's no need to voluntarily tread
a steep and rugged path,

1216
01:40:02,246 --> 01:40:04,498
not knowing what's ahead.

1217
01:40:05,624 --> 01:40:07,960
You'll have to step over
the corpses of your comrades.

1218
01:40:09,086 --> 01:40:14,091
Anyone would choose a shortcut
with a fixed outcome.

1219
01:40:14,758 --> 01:40:15,759
Yes.

1220
01:40:16,510 --> 01:40:20,389
The goal a Hokage should
seek is world peace.

1221
01:40:21,807 --> 01:40:23,684
What the hell are you talking about?

1222
01:40:24,526 --> 01:40:27,445
What I want to know about
isn't a shortcut...

1223
01:40:29,231 --> 01:40:31,442
but how to navigate
the steep and rugged path!

1224
01:40:35,570 --> 01:40:39,032
Would you still say that
if the final destination...

1225
01:40:39,983 --> 01:40:41,442
were the same?

1226
01:40:41,618 --> 01:40:46,457
Who can tell in the beginning
which one is the dangerous one?

1227
01:40:47,124 --> 01:40:49,877
You never know until
someone starts walking.

1228
01:40:50,961 --> 01:40:54,048
The Hokage is someone
who endures the pain

1229
01:40:54,272 --> 01:40:56,774
and takes the lead in front
of everyone...

1230
01:40:57,301 --> 01:41:00,268
So a Hokage never walks
over his comrades' corpses.

1231
01:41:01,362 --> 01:41:04,014
There is no shortcut to
becoming the Hokage!

1232
01:41:04,558 --> 01:41:07,561
And there are no ways out for
the one who becomes Hokage!

1233
01:41:08,144 --> 01:41:09,229
Isn't that right?

1234
01:41:16,428 --> 01:41:18,021
I messed up...

1235
01:41:18,555 --> 01:41:20,299
I got some sand in my eyes and...

1236
01:41:28,749 --> 01:41:33,420
A scar or two on a man
is a badge of courage!

1237
01:41:33,778 --> 01:41:36,989
I was just thinking how
I needed that.

1238
01:41:37,374 --> 01:41:39,209
So this wound's...

1239
01:41:39,234 --> 01:41:40,235
Ouch!

1240
01:41:46,190 --> 01:41:48,484
Don't act tough and
hide your wounds.

1241
01:41:49,569 --> 01:41:51,530
I'm always watching you.

1242
01:41:53,231 --> 01:41:56,401
You promised me that you would
become Hokage, Obito.

1243
01:41:57,494 --> 01:42:00,706
Listen, I want to stop this war too.

1244
01:42:01,073 --> 01:42:03,867
I really want to save the world.

1245
01:42:04,584 --> 01:42:09,506
So I decided to stick by your side
and watch over you.

1246
01:42:13,009 --> 01:42:14,469
You told me saving you

1247
01:42:14,711 --> 01:42:17,297
was the same as saving
the world, remember?

1248
01:42:24,479 --> 01:42:25,205
Yeah...

1249
01:42:25,973 --> 01:42:27,891
Since I'm keeping an eye on you,

1250
01:42:28,825 --> 01:42:30,994
you can't hide anything
from me anymore.

1251
01:42:31,529 --> 01:42:33,489
Okay! Okay!

1252
01:42:34,898 --> 01:42:36,441
Go for it, Obito!

1253
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:41,103
Become Hokage and show me
how you'll save the world.

1254
01:42:41,780 --> 01:42:43,532
That's another promise!

1255
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:46,601
Let's go!

1256
01:43:06,346 --> 01:43:07,347
You...

1257
01:43:08,240 --> 01:43:10,843
You told Kakashi Sensei
you would throw away

1258
01:43:11,034 --> 01:43:13,270
all your memories and feelings
about your comrades.

1259
01:43:14,313 --> 01:43:16,398
But when you became
the Ten-Tails' Jinchuriki

1260
01:43:16,481 --> 01:43:18,901
and were about to
be taken over by it...

1261
01:43:23,113 --> 01:43:26,984
Didn't you try to suppress the
Ten-Tails because you didn't want that?

1262
01:43:30,303 --> 01:43:33,264
The reason why you beat
the Ten-Tails and could control it

1263
01:43:34,333 --> 01:43:37,502
was because you stood firm
on not throwing away the past

1264
01:43:37,586 --> 01:43:39,421
and stayed yourself, right?

1265
01:43:39,821 --> 01:43:42,407
You just couldn't throw out
the memories of

1266
01:43:42,432 --> 01:43:47,771
my dad, Kakashi Sensei or
this Rin person, could you?

1267
01:43:49,039 --> 01:43:51,700
That's how you could stay Obito

1268
01:43:52,157 --> 01:43:54,053
even after you became
the Ten-Tails' Jinchuriki.

1269
01:43:56,145 --> 01:43:57,230
Am I wrong?

1270
01:44:05,405 --> 01:44:09,868
But dragging everyone with you
onto your path

1271
01:44:10,285 --> 01:44:11,787
and continuing on it
won't be allowed!

1272
01:44:12,663 --> 01:44:15,999
I'm bringing you back
as Obito Uchiha...

1273
01:44:16,416 --> 01:44:18,210
as a shinobi of the Hidden Leaf...

1274
01:44:18,576 --> 01:44:20,495
and you're going to atone
for your sins.

1275
01:44:24,091 --> 01:44:26,677
You tried to run away
from every single thing.

1276
01:44:27,344 --> 01:44:31,181
I bet this Rin person would say this
if she were still alive...

1277
01:44:32,307 --> 01:44:34,893
Don't act tough and
hide your wounds.

1278
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:37,354
I'm always watching.

1279
01:44:40,357 --> 01:44:43,068
You're no one else but you,
damn it!

1280
01:44:43,176 --> 01:44:44,144
Don't run away!

1281
01:44:45,629 --> 01:44:48,465
Come join us...

1282
01:44:49,707 --> 01:44:50,508
Obito!

1283
01:45:15,075 --> 01:45:17,452
I will never go over
to your side!

1284
01:45:18,645 --> 01:45:21,231
I have no regrets with
my path up until now.

1285
01:45:22,024 --> 01:45:26,570
I told you I saw everything.

1286
01:45:28,697 --> 01:45:29,698
So…

1287
01:45:30,881 --> 01:45:32,007
don't…

1288
01:45:34,511 --> 01:45:37,062
keep imagining yourself as Hokage!

1289
01:45:53,347 --> 01:45:56,850
The person Rin wanted to watch over
isn't the current you…

1290
01:45:58,143 --> 01:45:59,311
It was Obito Uchiha.

1291
01:46:13,450 --> 01:46:16,661
We're late again because
of you…Obito.

1292
01:46:17,287 --> 01:46:18,288
Let's go, Obito.

1293
01:46:20,207 --> 01:46:22,000
Sorry! We'll be right there.

1294
01:46:23,659 --> 01:46:24,393
Rin…

1295
01:46:48,743 --> 01:46:49,744
<i>That's right…</i>

1296
01:46:50,028 --> 01:46:52,864
<i>You ought to fill in that hole
in your heart yourself…</i>

1297
01:46:53,982 --> 01:46:56,484
<i>Others will be of no help.</i>

1298
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:01,072
<i>So…come over here.</i>

1299
01:47:01,832 --> 01:47:03,750
<i>I won't ignore you.</i>

1300
01:47:04,376 --> 01:47:05,085
<i>Come…</i>

1301
01:47:05,335 --> 01:47:06,336
<i>Come…</i>

1302
01:47:06,461 --> 01:47:07,379
<i>Obito…</i>

1303
01:47:07,562 --> 01:47:08,563
Hold on, Rin!

1304
01:47:14,201 --> 01:47:17,997
That's right...Rin won't even turn
to look at the current you.

1305
01:47:18,681 --> 01:47:21,893
The one Rin wanted to watch over
is Obito Uchiha.

1306
01:47:23,762 --> 01:47:25,055
Enough already…

1307
01:47:25,647 --> 01:47:26,648
I am…

1308
01:47:28,191 --> 01:47:29,484
Obito Uchiha!

1309
01:47:30,051 --> 01:47:32,368
Now just come over, you bastard!

1310
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:35,189
Everyone's power…

1311
01:48:43,983 --> 01:48:45,503
Don't you dare underestimate it!

1312
01:48:46,718 --> 01:48:47,886
They're out!

1313
01:48:55,779 --> 01:48:57,822
– All right!
– We did it!

1314
01:48:58,072 --> 01:48:59,865
– We did it!
– We did it!

1315
01:49:00,116 --> 01:49:01,876
Yes!

1316
01:49:20,095 --> 01:49:23,473
<i>Did I…lose?</i>

1317
01:50:00,552 --> 01:50:01,553
<i>Let's go.</i>

1318
01:50:13,523 --> 01:50:14,524
Rin…

1319
01:50:23,366 --> 01:50:27,120
<i>You kept your promise,
Naruto Uzumaki!</i>

1320
01:50:28,163 --> 01:50:29,623
<i>We were lucky.</i>

1321
01:50:30,206 --> 01:50:31,458
<i>He did it.</i>

1322
01:50:31,916 --> 01:50:33,168
<i>For real.</i>

1323
01:50:33,484 --> 01:50:34,444
<i>You're right.</i>

1324
01:50:34,702 --> 01:50:35,745
<i>I'm so glad!</i>

1325
01:50:38,806 --> 01:50:40,850
<i>Isn't he…?</i>

1326
01:50:47,931 --> 01:50:49,057
H-Hey!

1327
01:50:49,467 --> 01:50:50,676
Wait, Sasuke!

1328
01:50:51,895 --> 01:50:53,813
Where is he?!
Where'd he go?!

1329
01:50:54,522 --> 01:50:56,691
Over there! He's still alive!

1330
01:51:04,765 --> 01:51:07,435
<i>Right…I've lost…</i>

1331
01:51:15,092 --> 01:51:16,093
Kakashi!

1332
01:51:16,936 --> 01:51:19,500
Sasuke, we'll talk later.

1333
01:51:20,448 --> 01:51:21,949
I apologize for appearing
so suddenly…

1334
01:51:22,509 --> 01:51:25,011
But I was once
his classmate and friend…

1335
01:51:25,637 --> 01:51:27,472
So please let me
take responsibility for him.

1336
01:51:30,224 --> 01:51:31,225
Kakashi Sensei!

1337
01:51:31,417 --> 01:51:32,293
He's now—!

1338
01:51:39,943 --> 01:51:40,944
Dad!

1339
01:51:44,038 --> 01:51:45,289
He's weak now!

1340
01:51:45,490 --> 01:51:47,534
Now's the time to finish him!

1341
01:51:47,701 --> 01:51:48,368
Let's go!

1342
01:51:48,493 --> 01:51:49,285
– Right!
– Right!

1343
01:51:49,310 --> 01:51:50,311
Hold it!

1344
01:51:51,479 --> 01:51:52,480
Obito…

1345
01:51:52,664 --> 01:51:54,499
When we had that
chakra tug-of-war just now,

1346
01:51:54,999 --> 01:51:57,377
I got to see inside your heart.

1347
01:52:00,296 --> 01:52:03,299
It seems like my son nagged
and lectured you quite a bit.

1348
01:52:04,082 --> 01:52:06,752
I think he might have gotten that
from his mother.

1349
01:52:08,087 --> 01:52:08,914
Dad…

1350
01:52:10,223 --> 01:52:13,393
But that duty actually falls…
on you.

1351
01:52:17,004 --> 01:52:19,090
I think the one who truly
understands Obito

1352
01:52:19,273 --> 01:52:21,108
and should talk to him…

1353
01:52:22,068 --> 01:52:24,696
is you, his friend…Kakashi.

1354
01:52:29,826 --> 01:52:31,286
Isn't that right, Naruto?

1355
01:52:50,930 --> 01:52:53,391
Naruto, you two and
the Allied Forces should go

1356
01:52:53,556 --> 01:52:57,560
and help Lord First,
and seal Madara away.

1357
01:52:57,979 --> 01:53:00,273
Oh, right! We still need
to deal with him!

1358
01:53:01,107 --> 01:53:02,358
Let's go, Sasuke!

1359
01:53:04,844 --> 01:53:07,889
I think you were younger
than Naruto is now.

1360
01:53:09,581 --> 01:53:10,833
Do you remember?

1361
01:53:11,267 --> 01:53:13,394
All the missions that
the four of us went on?

1362
01:53:14,462 --> 01:53:19,092
As a medic ninja, Rin did
her utmost to protect you two.

1363
01:53:19,909 --> 01:53:22,369
She would never have wished
for a situation like this.

1364
01:53:27,601 --> 01:53:31,771
But what caused this
is my responsibility.

1365
01:53:33,014 --> 01:53:37,502
It's no coincidence that I, who should be
dead, am standing before you two like this.

1366
01:53:38,311 --> 01:53:39,854
Perhaps it was Rin
who made it happen…

1367
01:53:40,271 --> 01:53:42,967
Her way of scolding me
for failing as your teacher.

1368
01:53:51,699 --> 01:53:54,702
I'm sorry I couldn't protect Rin.

1369
01:54:08,174 --> 01:54:09,217
Rin…

1370
01:54:10,326 --> 01:54:13,621
Rin was my only light and hope.

1371
01:54:15,723 --> 01:54:17,517
After I lost Rin…

1372
01:54:18,234 --> 01:54:20,695
The world as I saw it, changed.

1373
01:54:21,404 --> 01:54:22,947
It became a pitch black hell.

1374
01:54:24,107 --> 01:54:26,067
There's no hope in this world.

1375
01:54:27,402 --> 01:54:29,904
I took Madara's identity
and walked the world.

1376
01:54:30,864 --> 01:54:33,616
But all it did was confirm my belief.

1377
01:54:34,492 --> 01:54:38,830
Even with my Sharingan,
I couldn't see anything…

1378
01:54:39,855 --> 01:54:41,648
There was nothing to see.

1379
01:54:45,361 --> 01:54:47,196
I don't know anything
for sure either…

1380
01:54:50,758 --> 01:54:53,803
Then…my new path is—!

1381
01:54:54,011 --> 01:54:58,473
Without a doubt,
your path is just one of many.

1382
01:54:59,442 --> 01:55:02,236
And it may not actually
be wrong either.

1383
01:55:08,985 --> 01:55:11,446
I've thought this world was hell too.

1384
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:14,824
I thought that you had died…

1385
01:55:15,617 --> 01:55:17,535
And right after that, I lost Rin…

1386
01:55:18,411 --> 01:55:20,705
And I lost Minato Sensei as well.

1387
01:55:22,916 --> 01:55:23,917
But…

1388
01:55:27,745 --> 01:55:29,413
Even though I don't know
anything for sure…

1389
01:55:30,014 --> 01:55:32,057
I tried my best to see
the world with this eye.

1390
01:55:33,134 --> 01:55:36,388
I felt that as long as I had
your Sharingan and words…

1391
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:38,347
I could see it.

1392
01:55:42,385 --> 01:55:45,721
And what you saw is Naruto?

1393
01:55:46,856 --> 01:55:49,943
How can you be sure
his path won't fail?

1394
01:55:52,946 --> 01:55:54,030
No…

1395
01:55:55,365 --> 01:55:58,868
He may very well fail too.
Of course.

1396
01:56:02,747 --> 01:56:04,958
How is Naruto different from me?

1397
01:56:05,757 --> 01:56:07,384
Why do you go so far for him?

1398
01:56:07,752 --> 01:56:09,796
Because I can say
without hesitation

1399
01:56:10,530 --> 01:56:12,982
that he is less likely to fail
than the current you.

1400
01:56:13,007 --> 01:56:14,050
Why is that?!

1401
01:56:18,137 --> 01:56:21,724
Because if he trips and stumbles
on his path…

1402
01:56:21,849 --> 01:56:22,850
I'll help him.

1403
01:56:27,647 --> 01:56:30,358
Why would you help him?

1404
01:56:40,935 --> 01:56:45,899
He would never give up
on his dreams…or on reality.

1405
01:56:47,458 --> 01:56:48,876
That's the kind of guy he is.

1406
01:56:49,460 --> 01:56:50,545
Found him!

1407
01:56:52,672 --> 01:56:56,718
And the way he forges ahead
draws others towards him.

1408
01:56:57,517 --> 01:56:59,770
He makes you want to reach out
when he's about to stumble.

1409
01:57:00,138 --> 01:57:02,348
And the greater
the support behind you,

1410
01:57:02,915 --> 01:57:04,349
the closer you can get to your goal.

1411
01:57:05,601 --> 01:57:06,894
That's the difference.

1412
01:57:28,750 --> 01:57:30,543
<i>Massive Rasen Shuriken!</i>

1413
01:57:30,917 --> 01:57:33,670
Bigger! We'll go with something
even bigger!

1414
01:57:33,695 --> 01:57:34,696
– Right!
– Right!

1415
01:57:38,301 --> 01:57:42,722
Do you really believe
such a thing is possible

1416
01:57:43,131 --> 01:57:44,633
in this pitch-black hell?

1417
01:57:45,231 --> 01:57:47,768
I'm sure you could've seen it too,
if you had tried.

1418
01:57:49,044 --> 01:57:51,963
After all,
you and I have the same eyes.

1419
01:57:54,192 --> 01:57:56,277
If comrades that you trust,
gather around you…

1420
01:57:56,952 --> 01:57:59,856
hope can take physical form
and become visible.

1421
01:58:02,784 --> 01:58:04,994
That's what I believe…

1422
01:58:08,289 --> 01:58:09,306
Obito.

1423
01:58:17,449 --> 01:58:19,034
<i>Naruto's path…</i>

1424
01:58:21,102 --> 01:58:21,927
Take this!

1425
01:58:22,178 --> 01:58:24,664
<i>Massive Rasen Shuriken!</i>

1426
01:58:27,058 --> 01:58:30,019
That Wood Dragon will absorb
your chakra!

1427
01:58:34,732 --> 01:58:38,236
Your chakra-stealing ninjutsu
has now been nullified!

1428
01:58:38,653 --> 01:58:39,863
In other words, you can't move

1429
01:58:40,137 --> 01:58:42,890
nor will you be able to extract chakra
with your next ninjutsu!

1430
01:58:44,466 --> 01:58:46,677
<i>Good timing, son of the Fourth!</i>

1431
01:58:47,178 --> 01:58:50,295
<i>Let's get him with this
and seal him away!</i>

1432
01:58:56,095 --> 01:59:00,541
Naruto aimed his attack over there,
so that's where Madara is!

1433
01:59:01,384 --> 01:59:02,677
Naruto, this way!

1434
01:59:03,536 --> 01:59:04,344
Let's go!

1435
01:59:04,477 --> 01:59:05,902
Thanks, Sai!

1436
01:59:06,488 --> 01:59:07,489
Don't waste any time!

1437
01:59:07,640 --> 01:59:09,559
Now's our chance to seal him!

1438
01:59:09,809 --> 01:59:12,270
We won't let Naruto's attack
go to waste!

1439
01:59:12,427 --> 01:59:13,262
Right!

1440
01:59:14,989 --> 01:59:17,700
Without any orders…
without a single word…

1441
01:59:18,025 --> 01:59:20,319
Everyone is galvanized into action…

1442
01:59:21,612 --> 01:59:22,613
Naruto…

1443
01:59:26,334 --> 01:59:27,335
Shukaku…

1444
01:59:28,059 --> 01:59:31,646
I'd like to borrow the power of
your Sand to seal Madara.

1445
01:59:32,239 --> 01:59:34,631
<i>You mean,
the Grand Sand Mausoleum?</i>

1446
01:59:34,834 --> 01:59:37,461
That's right...A giant one too.

1447
01:59:40,298 --> 01:59:43,718
<i>I'm not bound to a Jinchuriki anymore.</i>

1448
01:59:44,010 --> 01:59:47,847
<i>What makes you think I'd listen
to you after all this time?</i>

1449
01:59:48,547 --> 01:59:51,550
I'm not ordering you.
I'm asking you.

1450
01:59:52,435 --> 01:59:53,603
If you refuse, fine.

1451
01:59:54,010 --> 01:59:56,187
I'll just ask one of the others.

1452
01:59:59,983 --> 02:00:02,202
<i>Naruto Uzumaki, huh?</i>

1453
02:00:02,528 --> 02:00:08,159
<i>Seems you've become friends
with that Fox Demon's brat, Gaara…</i>

1454
02:00:08,458 --> 02:00:11,377
If you're not going to help,
let's talk later.

1455
02:00:11,662 --> 02:00:12,663
I'm going.

1456
02:00:14,207 --> 02:00:17,501
<i>That tone you're using ticks me off!</i>

1457
02:00:18,260 --> 02:00:20,888
<i>As they say, if a fox has
seven tricks, a tanuki has eight!</i>

1458
02:00:21,530 --> 02:00:24,866
<i>And I, the Demon Tanuki,
will not lose to a stupid fox!</i>

1459
02:00:26,653 --> 02:00:29,447
<i>I'm not doing this
because you asked!</i>

1460
02:00:29,763 --> 02:00:32,366
<i>I'm doing this because I want to!</i>

1461
02:00:33,643 --> 02:00:34,852
<i>Lead the way.</i>

1462
02:00:36,270 --> 02:00:37,271
It's this way.

1463
02:00:37,721 --> 02:00:38,873
<i>Now then…</i>

1464
02:00:38,898 --> 02:00:39,899
<i>Wait up.</i>

1465
02:00:40,191 --> 02:00:41,192
<i>Huh?</i>

1466
02:00:43,611 --> 02:00:45,613
<i>We'll help too.</i>

1467
02:00:48,908 --> 02:00:49,909
I'm grateful.

1468
02:00:50,959 --> 02:00:52,995
<i>Sage Art: Gracious Deity Gates!</i>

1469
02:00:59,085 --> 02:01:01,671
<i>Naruto's jutsu didn't bring him down,</i>

1470
02:01:02,112 --> 02:01:05,824
<i>but with this,
he won't be able to move at all!</i>

1471
02:01:06,634 --> 02:01:10,096
<i>All that's left is to wait for
the sealing shinobi.</i>

1472
02:01:28,698 --> 02:01:31,409
Having the Tailed Beasts
extracted from him

1473
02:01:31,793 --> 02:01:33,018
means that Obito's...

1474
02:01:34,036 --> 02:01:38,124
<i>The Ten-Tails' Jinchuriki aren't
like all the others.</i>

1475
02:01:39,625 --> 02:01:42,086
<i>They won't die if
the Tailed Beast is extracted.</i>

1476
02:01:43,004 --> 02:01:48,676
<i>It's because the Ten-Tails' husk,
the Gedo Statue remains.</i>

1477
02:01:50,001 --> 02:01:52,546
<i>It contains a lot of life force.</i>

1478
02:01:53,347 --> 02:01:54,557
Is that true?

1479
02:01:54,640 --> 02:01:56,642
How do you know?

1480
02:01:56,809 --> 02:01:58,185
<i>Hey, now.</i>

1481
02:01:58,327 --> 02:02:01,163
<i>Who do you think scattered us
all across the world</i>

1482
02:02:01,188 --> 02:02:04,817
<i>after splitting Ten-Tails' chakra
into nine pieces?</i>

1483
02:02:06,844 --> 02:02:08,554
The Sage of Six Paths...

1484
02:02:09,113 --> 02:02:12,783
<i>But with nine bodies extracted out
of him all at once,</i>

1485
02:02:12,808 --> 02:02:15,102
<i>he'll be so weak it will
be like he's dead.</i>

1486
02:02:15,235 --> 02:02:17,946
<i>He won't be able to move
for a few months.</i>

1487
02:02:18,981 --> 02:02:21,608
<i>Just as it was for
the old man back then.</i>

1488
02:02:22,693 --> 02:02:24,403
So that's how it goes.

1489
02:02:25,755 --> 02:02:27,173
Kakashi...

1490
02:02:28,466 --> 02:02:31,260
the Tailed Beast inside me
just explained to me...

1491
02:02:35,181 --> 02:02:40,102
I was hoping he would atone
for all his past deeds, but...

1492
02:02:42,396 --> 02:02:44,732
It can't be helped if you can't move.

1493
02:02:45,358 --> 02:02:47,526
Just stay put.

1494
02:02:49,695 --> 02:02:52,948
Sensei, please keep an eye
on Obito.

1495
02:02:53,290 --> 02:02:54,333
All right.

1496
02:03:01,457 --> 02:03:03,125
What are you trying to do?

1497
02:03:08,339 --> 02:03:11,410
The same thing the man
I once tried to use...

1498
02:03:12,551 --> 02:03:15,785
did to betray me.

1499
02:03:19,284 --> 02:03:20,604
It's the Gedo...

1500
02:03:21,560 --> 02:03:24,012
Art of Rinne Rebirth.

1501
02:03:26,207 --> 02:03:31,754
I feel like I finally understand
why Nagato…

1502
02:03:32,688 --> 02:03:34,865
betrayed me back then.

1503
02:03:37,843 --> 02:03:44,091
A string of hearts linked together
like prayer beads...

1504
02:03:45,209 --> 02:03:48,587
That can be a strong power
as well, huh...

1505
02:03:49,872 --> 02:03:53,633
Nagato and Naruto were
both Jiraiya's students.

1506
02:03:54,068 --> 02:03:59,474
So you could say
Jiraiya defeated me.

1507
02:04:01,125 --> 02:04:02,059
Sensei...

1508
02:04:03,602 --> 02:04:05,687
He was also your master,

1509
02:04:06,030 --> 02:04:09,199
the one who groomed you
to become the Hokage...

1510
02:04:11,569 --> 02:04:16,683
And I...was your student.

1511
02:04:19,535 --> 02:04:22,687
A shinobi who gave up
on becoming Hokage...

1512
02:04:22,712 --> 02:04:25,715
and cut all his ties.

1513
02:04:32,939 --> 02:04:39,654
I won't have much to say
to Rin on the other side.

1514
02:04:46,445 --> 02:04:51,650
<i>I'll help you out this time!</i>

1515
02:04:54,028 --> 02:04:55,488
Time to switch places!

1516
02:04:57,156 --> 02:05:00,201
It's now my turn to attack!

1517
02:05:00,993 --> 02:05:02,203
Stop acting tough!

1518
02:05:02,745 --> 02:05:04,389
This war is over!

1519
02:05:09,617 --> 02:05:11,202
– Sai!
– I know!

1520
02:05:12,796 --> 02:05:13,739
<i>Sealing Jutsu!</i>

1521
02:05:14,924 --> 02:05:16,166
<i>Crouched Tiger Bullet!</i>

1522
02:05:18,277 --> 02:05:19,528
Naruto...

1523
02:05:20,937 --> 02:05:23,231
I'm grateful to you.

1524
02:05:24,517 --> 02:05:28,020
You even extracted
the Tailed Beasts from Obito...

1525
02:05:31,081 --> 02:05:34,642
Saving me the trouble
of weakening him.

1526
02:05:35,293 --> 02:05:37,671
<i>Sorry, Obito...</i>

1527
02:05:38,488 --> 02:05:42,659
<i>This is the reason
why I was stuck onto you.</i>

1528
02:05:43,126 --> 02:05:45,545
Black Zetsu!
W-What the—?!

1529
02:05:47,248 --> 02:05:48,666
Okay! Just a little bit longer!

1530
02:05:50,376 --> 02:05:52,519
– <i>Art of Rinne Rebirth!</i>
– <i>Art of Rinne Rebirth!</i>

1531
02:05:55,705 --> 02:05:58,291
Finally, I can fight for real!
