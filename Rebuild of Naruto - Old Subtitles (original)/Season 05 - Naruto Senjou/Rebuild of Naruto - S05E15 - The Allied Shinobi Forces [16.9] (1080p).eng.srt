1
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:09,217
I-Is that...?!

2
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:10,427
That's the...!

3
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:12,053
<i>There's no mistaking it.</i>

4
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:27,569
<i>Yeah…</i>

5
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,260
<i>That's…</i>

6
00:00:37,885 --> 00:00:39,011
<i>The Ten-Tails!</i>

7
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,880
But I thought the Statue's evil chakra
had disappeared!

8
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:59,851
Damn it! They got us!

9
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:03,271
<i>That thing doesn't have
that kind of emotion of feeling!</i>

10
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,274
<i>It can't be sensed.</i>

11
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,736
<i>It's Natural Energy itself.</i>

12
00:01:09,975 --> 00:01:12,477
<i>It's the same as that which
circulates around the world,</i>

13
00:01:12,502 --> 00:01:16,256
<i>that you can feel in
the soil, water, and the air.</i>

14
00:01:16,574 --> 00:01:18,701
<i>It would be a different story
if you tried it</i>

15
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:22,290
<i>while engaged in Sage Mode though.</i>

16
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:23,941
Got it!

17
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,961
So if you say he's all Nature Energy,

18
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,339
then I can check him out!

19
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,257
<i>Forget it, Naruto…</i>

20
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,385
<i>Even if you tried something like that…</i>

21
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:40,850
<i>All you'll see is just
how immeasurable it is.</i>

22
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:44,646
You're not kidding.

23
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:54,656
I had planned to capture them
before the Ten-Tails revived, but...

24
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,699
They're pretty good.

25
00:01:57,219 --> 00:02:00,014
I want to start the Infinite Tsukuyomi
ritual immediately.

26
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:05,291
That great genjutsu requires time
to summon the moon.

27
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,419
They will interfere with the jutsu.

28
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,255
Things will go more smoothly

29
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,715
if we use the Statue's power
to get rid of them first.

30
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,259
Don't you agree?

31
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,344
Madara…

32
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,639
You just want to test
the Ten-Tails' power, don't you?

33
00:02:21,426 --> 00:02:23,136
You're like a child.

34
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,561
No.

35
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,690
Brats are impatient, touchy fools.

36
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:38,032
<i>Hey...Here comes a big one.</i>

37
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,993
<i>You think we can really do this?</i>

38
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,537
<i>Don't think you can hide
under your tentacles</i>

39
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,330
<i>'cuz you're scared!</i>

40
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:47,292
<i>But first, hand me Guy over there.</i>

41
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,752
<i>I'll heal him later.</i>

42
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,736
<i>And that Naruto and Kakashi too!</i>

43
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,007
Yeah!

44
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,216
<i>Here you go!</i>

45
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:01,890
<i>Listen up.</i>

46
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,475
<i>First, we keep our distance
and see what move he makes!</i>

47
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,895
<i>Then we'll counter the attack</i>

48
00:03:07,346 --> 00:03:10,057
<i>and hit him with a big blow
as close as we can get.</i>

49
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,275
<i>Just like I said earlier!</i>

50
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,986
Nine-Tails,
you're acting like a captain.

51
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,488
<i>Huh? You got a problem with that?!</i>

52
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,656
Nope…

53
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,450
In fact, I feel kind of happy!

54
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,580
<i>That line...</i>

55
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:27,794
<i>Save it for after we've won!</i>

56
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:29,700
<i>Let's go!</i>

57
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,727
<i>It's surprisingly fast…</i>

58
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,355
<i>There wasn't any time to
observe its moves!</i>

59
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,522
<i>Damn it!</i>

60
00:04:14,564 --> 00:04:15,816
Now! Eight-O!

61
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,098
<i>Tailed Beast...</i>

62
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,891
<i>Bomb Barrage!</i>

63
00:04:29,049 --> 00:04:30,837
There's no need to dodge.

64
00:04:31,314 --> 00:04:34,442
I want to preserve Ten-Tails' power
as much as possible.

65
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,656
<i>This is…</i>

66
00:04:42,504 --> 00:04:43,589
<i>…not good!</i>

67
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,767
It's all on you now!

68
00:05:23,361 --> 00:05:25,238
Persistent lot!

69
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,453
Hey, Naruto, don't tell me...

70
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,331
Don't worry Bushier Brow Sensei.

71
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,668
<i>Nice control, Naruto!</i>

72
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,297
<i>You got them in nice and close!</i>

73
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:42,175
<i>We focused too much on Ten-Tails.</i>

74
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,510
<i>Sorry about the one leg.</i>

75
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,220
<i>But here we go!</i>

76
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:48,765
<i>Kamui!</i>

77
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,118
<i>I'm gonna smash this
into his eyeball!</i>

78
00:06:00,173 --> 00:06:01,174
<i>Huh?!</i>

79
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,169
There are two flies above us as well…

80
00:06:18,698 --> 00:06:19,782
<i>Kakashi!</i>

81
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,931
<i>Naruto, you really are
a lot like me.</i>

82
00:06:33,356 --> 00:06:36,776
<i>That's right,
you're just younger than me.</i>

83
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,106
<i>Eventually…</i>

84
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:49,200
<i>Forgive me, Eight-O and Octopops!</i>

85
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,371
Another Shadow Clone, huh?

86
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,106
Kurama!

87
00:07:26,314 --> 00:07:28,149
How can you fall apart
at a time like this?!

88
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:29,907
<i>That was about eight minutes.</i>

89
00:07:30,414 --> 00:07:33,650
<i>It's longer than before,
but that's the limit.</i>

90
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,914
<i>I'm going to have to infuse
and build up my chakra.</i>

91
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,584
Guess we have no choice.

92
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,757
That hurts, fool. Ya fool!

93
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:48,513
<i>Bee!</i>

94
00:07:48,564 --> 00:07:51,173
<i>I'm going to rest a bit too.
I'm also at my limit.</i>

95
00:07:52,621 --> 00:07:55,102
I can't get healed yet?

96
00:07:56,617 --> 00:07:59,495
<i>Pulling something as massive
as Eight-Tails in and out</i>

97
00:07:59,892 --> 00:08:01,644
<i>sure comes with
a correspondingly large cost.</i>

98
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,024
<i>I'm drained already.</i>

99
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:09,989
Seems Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails
have run out of chakra for now.

100
00:08:19,706 --> 00:08:21,862
You favorite Shadow Clone Jutsu?

101
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:24,086
It may be forbidden high-level ninjutsu,

102
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,339
but just increasing
the number of losers won't--

103
00:08:26,364 --> 00:08:27,866
I'm not a loser!

104
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,008
Stop, Naruto!

105
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,732
It's meaningless to
create Shadow Clones

106
00:08:31,757 --> 00:08:33,258
that will divide your chakra
even more.

107
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,849
They might be useful as diversions,
but not for decisive hits.

108
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,684
And if you go down...

109
00:08:39,382 --> 00:08:40,717
we lose this war.

110
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:44,848
You were always just
a motley crew anyway.

111
00:08:44,873 --> 00:08:45,916
Huh?!

112
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,153
M-M-Motley crew?

113
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:52,590
Like I said, you're incompetent.

114
00:08:53,435 --> 00:08:56,605
He's saying that it's pointless to
merely increase the number of heads...

115
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,799
if they're all empty.

116
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:02,744
You and I are both powerless shinobi.

117
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:04,743
You...

118
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,382
no, I should say everyone…

119
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,135
will eventually end up like me.

120
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,974
I'll never end up like you!

121
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,059
How many times
do I have to tell you?!

122
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,603
My dream is to become the Hokage!

123
00:09:23,626 --> 00:09:24,824
Don't worry.

124
00:09:25,378 --> 00:09:26,879
Everything will go as planned.

125
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,987
There is no shinobi jutsu mightier
than the Infinite Tsukuyomi.

126
00:09:31,754 --> 00:09:35,424
I'll make you Hokage inside this jutsu.

127
00:09:37,426 --> 00:09:38,427
So…

128
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,122
Just disappear along
with the rest of this world!

129
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,325
What the…?

130
00:10:19,543 --> 00:10:21,878
Did it miss? On purpose?

131
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,834
About time!

132
00:10:27,737 --> 00:10:29,197
Kakashi! Guy!

133
00:10:29,377 --> 00:10:30,712
Sorry to keep you waiting!

134
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,965
I can't believe he shook off

135
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:36,093
my Byakugan-aided, spot-on Mind Transfer
in just two seconds!

136
00:10:36,641 --> 00:10:39,394
But you still succeeded in shifting
that large thing's aim off target.

137
00:10:39,632 --> 00:10:40,591
Good work!

138
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,600
Are you all right, Naruto?

139
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,643
Yeah!

140
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:47,480
You don't have to act tough
in front of Hinata, Naruto!

141
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,149
<i>Beetle Jamming Jutsu!</i>

142
00:10:53,032 --> 00:10:54,784
<i>Hidden Mist Jutsu!</i>

143
00:11:02,936 --> 00:11:04,354
We're here, Naruto!

144
00:11:05,016 --> 00:11:08,061
All right, we won't be
so easily detectable now!

145
00:11:09,074 --> 00:11:11,785
Lord Bee! You're in better shape
than I expected!

146
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,144
Lord Bee! You look seriously wounded!

147
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,405
Omoi, you worry too much!

148
00:11:17,371 --> 00:11:19,540
Guy Sensei, don't tell me
you used Hirudora?!

149
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:20,579
Lee!

150
00:11:20,654 --> 00:11:22,614
I'm sorry we're late, Captain Kakashi.

151
00:11:23,456 --> 00:11:25,361
Sakura, first off...!

152
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:26,660
I know!

153
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:36,767
<i>The Sensory Water Sphere won't
maintain its original shape...</i>

154
00:11:37,553 --> 00:11:39,805
Inoichi! Ao! Confirm the situation!

155
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,742
- Roger!
- Okay!

156
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,664
First Company has arrived!

157
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:49,091
Second Company has also arrived!

158
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,585
Third Company has arrived!

159
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,748
Fourth Company has arrived!

160
00:11:54,485 --> 00:11:56,028
Fifth Company has also arrived!

161
00:11:56,596 --> 00:11:57,764
The Medical Unit's here too!

162
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,594
Sensory Unit has arrived!

163
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,432
Nice try hiding, but...

164
00:12:10,374 --> 00:12:11,500
<i>Wind Style:</i>

165
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,141
<i>Art of the Gust Blade!</i>

166
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:26,036
We're not a motley crew anymore!

167
00:12:26,406 --> 00:12:30,786
Here is the Allied Shinobi Forces Jutsu!

168
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:35,504
The world's greatest, most invincible,
super-duper ninjutsu, you know!

169
00:12:36,177 --> 00:12:39,347
A jutsu that trumps
the Infinite Tsukuyomi. Remember that!

170
00:12:40,837 --> 00:12:42,798
The Allied Shinobi Forces Jutsu, eh?

171
00:12:42,942 --> 00:12:44,902
Don't you think that's a bit of stretch?

172
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,804
We're going to stop you two
with this jutsu!

173
00:12:48,124 --> 00:12:49,118
You're wrong.

174
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:53,981
Why won't you realize that
it's meaningless for you to stop us here?

175
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:58,652
After this war,
even that jutsu will disintegrate…

176
00:12:59,005 --> 00:13:01,173
Then someone from your side
will attempt to do

177
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:02,992
exactly what we're doing now.

178
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,869
There is no victory,
no matter how much you struggle.

179
00:13:10,158 --> 00:13:12,202
Get it through your head.

180
00:13:12,566 --> 00:13:15,110
There's no such thing as hope
anywhere in this world.

181
00:13:25,449 --> 00:13:26,971
This world…

182
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,602
- will end!
- Will not end!

183
00:13:32,046 --> 00:13:33,047
Let's go, everyone!

184
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:35,339
This is the final deciding battle!

185
00:13:40,026 --> 00:13:41,027
Scatter!

186
00:13:43,616 --> 00:13:45,535
<i>Thanks for buying us
some time, Naruto.</i>

187
00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:48,232
<i>Did you have enough time
to come up with a strategy?</i>

188
00:13:48,752 --> 00:13:52,631
<i>Thanks to you, I was able to
relay it to everyone!</i>

189
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:56,377
<i>Kakashi told us the masked man
is Obito Uchiha.</i>

190
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:57,862
<i>But there's no time to be shocked.</i>

191
00:13:58,301 --> 00:14:00,689
<i>For this fight, we need to take
and maintain the upper hand</i>

192
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,591
<i>and not give them
any opportunity to counter!</i>

193
00:14:02,764 --> 00:14:05,808
<i>According to the intel we received,
our enemy has impressive eyes.</i>

194
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:12,225
<i>First, we'll impede their movement
by destroying their vision.</i>

195
00:14:12,825 --> 00:14:14,327
<i>The Hidden Cloud!</i>

196
00:14:17,575 --> 00:14:18,702
<i>Lightning Style:</i>

197
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:20,751
<i>Flash Pillar!</i>

198
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,707
<i>Gale Style: Laser Circus!</i>

199
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:40,574
I see…

200
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:44,466
Their true aim is to blind Ten-Tails!

201
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:47,653
<i>With the two jutsu from earlier,</i>

202
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,930
<i>the Hidden Mist's Mist
and the Beetle Jamming...</i>

203
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,908
<i>Along with the large volume
of airborne dust</i>

204
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,601
<i>stirred up by the Gale Style right now...</i>

205
00:14:55,339 --> 00:14:57,257
<i>The Hidden Sand, now!</i>

206
00:14:58,736 --> 00:15:00,988
<i>Wind Style: Air Current Dance!</i>

207
00:15:04,168 --> 00:15:06,504
<i>We'll not just destroy
their vision completely,</i>

208
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,700
<i>but thwart them from
even sensing us at all.</i>

209
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,453
<i>And since their sheer bulk
prevents them from hiding...</i>

210
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,789
<i>we'll be able to take
full advantage of the situation.</i>

211
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:19,165
<i>We only revealed our jutsu
to him a short while ago,</i>

212
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,984
<i>and he's already incorporating them
into the battle plan!</i>

213
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:24,095
<i>Leave it to Shikamaru's dad,
like father like son!</i>

214
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,100
This makes it impossible to sense them.

215
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:39,368
We'll wipe them all out with
a Ten-Tails' attack!

216
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:42,113
<i>The Hidden Stone,
proceed immediately!</i>

217
00:15:42,532 --> 00:15:43,764
We know!

218
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,072
<i>Earth Style: Vast Mobile Core!</i>

219
00:15:54,202 --> 00:15:57,080
<i>After shutting down their senses,
we'll immobilize them!</i>

220
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,298
<i>As soon as we bring down
the Ten-Tails, pour in quicklime!</i>

221
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,854
- <i>Lava Style: Quicklime Jutsu!</i>
- <i>Lava Style: Quicklime Jutsu!</i>

222
00:16:14,512 --> 00:16:16,389
<i>Hidden Mist! You're up next!</i>

223
00:16:17,203 --> 00:16:19,789
- <i>Water Style: Water Bomb Jutsu!</i>
- <i>Water Style: Water Bomb Jutsu!</i>

224
00:16:20,849 --> 00:16:22,767
<i>We'll add water to the mix,</i>

225
00:16:22,792 --> 00:16:25,670
<i>and rapidly stir up the quicklime!</i>

226
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:29,421
<i>Hidden Leaf! Let's finish this!</i>

227
00:16:30,442 --> 00:16:32,017
Sarutobi Clan members!

228
00:16:32,518 --> 00:16:33,519
Let's go!

229
00:16:33,544 --> 00:16:35,462
<i>Fire Style: Majestic Flame Jutsu!</i>

230
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,123
<i>And we'll dry it with the heat
from the Fire Style…</i>

231
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,302
<i>Let it set and immobilize it!</i>

232
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,075
Unbelievable.

233
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,893
Who would've thought,

234
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,980
that the ninja from the five villages
could work so cooperatively.

235
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,175
<i>Unless we stop the Ten-Tails,</i>

236
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,552
<i>we don't have a chance
to go after Obito or Madara.</i>

237
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:16,160
<i>The Ten-Tails is merely a tool
for them to aid in activating their jutsu.</i>

238
00:17:16,346 --> 00:17:19,013
<i>If we cut off the head from the body,
namely those two…</i>

239
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,707
<i>Infinite Tsukuyomi cannot
be activated!</i>

240
00:17:22,454 --> 00:17:25,769
<i>But keep in mind that
we won't be able to suppress</i>

241
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,880
<i>the Ten-Tails' power for too long.</i>

242
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,983
<i>Only physical attacks work
on Madara.</i>

243
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,094
<i>So shinobi who are skilled
in taijutsu will go after Madara!</i>

244
00:17:35,239 --> 00:17:37,995
<i>Obito can slip through
all moves and jutsu,</i>

245
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,888
<i>but according to our intel,
that only lasts for five minutes.</i>

246
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,185
<i>Coordinate with the Medical Unit and</i>

247
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,164
<i>keep attacking him
for more than five minutes!</i>

248
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,190
<i>Do not let up!</i>

249
00:17:46,473 --> 00:17:48,224
<i>That's right, Naruto...</i>

250
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,402
<i>It's now time for your...</i>

251
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:02,204
<i>Allied Shinobi Forces Jutsu!</i>

252
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,876
How pitiful.

253
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,586
Yeah.

254
00:18:08,581 --> 00:18:11,668
This hope that they're clinging to
doesn't exist.

255
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:16,887
Just like their very lives,
at this point.

256
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,099
It seems Ten-Tails is ready.

257
00:18:20,626 --> 00:18:22,795
<i>Fifth Gate of Closing! Open!</i>

258
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:28,565
<i>So this time, they're coming
after us, not Ten-Tails...</i>

259
00:18:29,251 --> 00:18:30,067
<i>Well...</i>

260
00:18:30,092 --> 00:18:32,636
<i>Taking the enemy's brains
is a fundamental strategy...</i>

261
00:18:34,087 --> 00:18:35,839
<i>For that to work...</i>

262
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:39,034
<i>they would need to
stop the Ten-Tails first!</i>

263
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:48,532
What?! I thought we had immobilized
the Ten-Tails!

264
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,296
Are you okay?! Damn it...

265
00:19:11,008 --> 00:19:12,886
<i>My shoulder's dislocated...</i>

266
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,154
Look at the Sensing Water Sphere...

267
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,990
It's practically like a small planet.

268
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,325
But that's...impossible!

269
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:22,946
So we didn't immobilize
Ten-Tails, after all?

270
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,955
It merely stopped moving on its own

271
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,207
in order to amass power
and undergo transformation?

272
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:29,376
How are we going to be able to stop it?

273
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,340
And now we can't target those two either!

274
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:34,255
<i>Even with the jutsu of my clan
who specialize in immobilizing...</i>

275
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,825
<i>the effect would be miniscule compared
to the amount of chakra expended.</i>

276
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,097
Inoichi!

277
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,432
Link me to Kakashi!

278
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,558
Roger!

279
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,393
<i>Kakashi, it's me!</i>

280
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,605
<i>There's something
I want to confirm</i>

281
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,690
<i>regarding the intel from
the last battle sequence...</i>

282
00:19:55,906 --> 00:19:59,201
It's going to start getting more difficult
to control Ten-Tails soon...

283
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:02,953
Reinforce your bond with it
using Hashirama's cells.

284
00:20:03,815 --> 00:20:08,737
Don't you want to check out
Ten-Tails' power in its current state?

285
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,500
First, let's...

286
00:20:10,717 --> 00:20:14,019
Yes, let's show them...

287
00:20:15,872 --> 00:20:17,290
...despair!

288
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,558
<i>Shikaku, I'm going to
let you go for now!</i>

289
00:20:26,742 --> 00:20:27,826
<i>What's the matter?!</i>

290
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:28,810
This is...

291
00:20:29,105 --> 00:20:30,314
No way!

292
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:33,822
Lord Shikaku! Lord Inoichi!

293
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:37,485
<i>My Kamui won't make it in time!</i>

294
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,571
Displace it upwards using
an Earth Style technique.

295
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,572
Right!

296
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,734
That far away?

297
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,838
It's so much greater than
all the previous Tailed Beasts!

298
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,590
What power!

299
00:21:00,016 --> 00:21:02,727
It's wobbly from just
that little counter...

300
00:21:02,752 --> 00:21:04,228
Its control isn't perfect yet.

301
00:21:04,253 --> 00:21:05,254
Next!

302
00:21:24,485 --> 00:21:27,742
Unbelievable! Such a far-off city
destroyed in an instant!

303
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,920
It's been acting strange for a while,
it seems to be aiming far away!

304
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:41,008
<i>So all the cities,
and people are within its range of fire?</i>

305
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,968
Then that means
the evacuated Feudal Lords,

306
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,511
everyone protecting the villages...

307
00:21:44,564 --> 00:21:47,421
plus all the citizens of
each nation aren't safe?

308
00:21:55,635 --> 00:21:57,095
<i>That's the direction of--!</i>

309
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:01,153
Please listen to me calmly.

310
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:08,994
Here, eh?

311
00:22:10,524 --> 00:22:12,247
Well, Shikaku...What do we do?

312
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,083
Just keep doing what we must do.

313
00:22:16,075 --> 00:22:17,269
It will be our last act.

314
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,212
Put me through to
everyone on the battlefield.

315
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:22,049
I have a plan to stop the Ten-Tails!

316
00:23:02,033 --> 00:23:03,784
Finally got them.

317
00:23:04,607 --> 00:23:07,402
We've now smashed
the brains of the Allied Forces.

318
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,262
Like I said before,
it's fundamental strategy.

319
00:23:12,646 --> 00:23:13,828
Shikamaru...

320
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,894
We're in the middle of a war.

321
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,938
Don't waste any words on me.

322
00:23:19,613 --> 00:23:20,841
Or on Ino.

323
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:27,239
Like Dad said, we just have
to do what we have to do.

324
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:11,777
Wait...What exactly just happened?!

325
00:25:12,872 --> 00:25:14,916
You are the key to our plan.

326
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:16,264
Not about that!

327
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:19,684
I'm asking what happened to
Shikaku and Inoichi?!

328
00:25:25,468 --> 00:25:27,375
Neji! Rotate clockwise!

329
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,276
Got it!

330
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,360
- <i>Eight Trigrams Palm Rotation!</i>
- <i>Eight Trigrams Palm Rotation!</i>

331
00:25:30,385 --> 00:25:32,038
A-Amazing...

332
00:25:34,455 --> 00:25:36,123
Don't just stand there
spacing out, Naruto!

333
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:38,453
This is a battlefield
and we're in a war.

334
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:41,033
People will die!

335
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:44,376
But if we are defeated
and lose this war...

336
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,503
everyone will die!

337
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,381
Of course I know that!

338
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,760
Shikamaru and Ino's father
would likely say, that as shinobi,

339
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:56,054
they're glad to have died
before their children.

340
00:25:56,735 --> 00:25:58,653
Just as my father did.

341
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:04,938
Naruto, your power is critical
to the plan.

342
00:26:05,291 --> 00:26:07,335
So until we execute it...

343
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,276
We must protect you, Naruto!

344
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:10,777
Know this!

345
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,280
The Hyuga are the mightiest
among the Hidden Leaf!

346
00:26:14,042 --> 00:26:17,008
There he goes...
I was hoping to take them down

347
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:19,035
before they started
with the speeches, but...

348
00:26:19,596 --> 00:26:22,182
It's hard to control Ten-Tails well.

349
00:26:23,504 --> 00:26:26,459
This ought to do until
the next transformation, but...

350
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,712
Afterwards...

351
00:26:28,886 --> 00:26:32,724
I suspect only a Jinchuriki will
be able to control it.

352
00:26:34,105 --> 00:26:36,816
Though for me to become
the Ten-Tails' Jinchuriki...

353
00:26:37,237 --> 00:26:40,240
I'll need to be fully alive,

354
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,852
not hosted within a corpse
as a Reanimation.

355
00:26:44,212 --> 00:26:48,045
They will know despair...thoroughly.

356
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:53,670
<i>Wood Style:</i>

357
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,071
<i>Cutting Sprigs!</i>

358
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,698
There's so many of them!

359
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,782
Just try to evade them.

360
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,823
<i>My Mountain Jutsu should
at least slow it down</i>

361
00:26:59,848 --> 00:27:02,754
<i>until Nine-Tails' strength returns.</i>

362
00:27:03,263 --> 00:27:05,265
<i>Except I need some time
to build up enough chakra!</i>

363
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,291
<i>Hold on, everybody!</i>

364
00:27:07,171 --> 00:27:08,798
Cha!

365
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,480
<i>So many!</i>

366
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:14,007
<i>My Rotation can't keep up!</i>

367
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:19,679
Thanks, Neji!

368
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,765
I can activate Sage Mode now!

369
00:27:21,941 --> 00:27:24,200
I can't keep relying on you geniuses!

370
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,560
Now it's my turn!

371
00:27:26,415 --> 00:27:27,917
<i>Rasen Shuriken!</i>

372
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,653
Here's a few more!

373
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:49,300
<i>Eight Trigrams: Air Wall Palm!</i>

374
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,731
<i>Damn it! A focused attack!</i>

375
00:27:54,955 --> 00:27:56,165
<i>There's too many!</i>

376
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,775
<i>Hinata and Neji's Air Palms
won't be sufficient...</i>

377
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,515
<i>Earth Style: Mountain Jutsu!</i>

378
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:07,977
Medical Team!

379
00:28:08,626 --> 00:28:10,455
Where are you?!
There's a critical injury here!

380
00:28:10,646 --> 00:28:11,856
Hurry!

381
00:28:13,312 --> 00:28:15,231
I'm no longer...

382
00:28:18,543 --> 00:28:19,836
Naruto...

383
00:28:22,134 --> 00:28:23,694
Lady Hinata...

384
00:28:24,874 --> 00:28:27,616
is willing to die for you.

385
00:28:29,769 --> 00:28:33,705
So...you hold more...

386
00:28:34,634 --> 00:28:37,678
than one...life in your hands...

387
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:47,434
And it seems...that my life too...
may have been...

388
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,437
one of them...

389
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,900
Why? Why did you do this here?

390
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,529
You were going to change
the Hyuga!

391
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:09,038
<i>Long ago, those words of yours,
freed me from the shackles of fate.</i>

392
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,000
<i>Father...</i>

393
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:16,671
<i>I finally understand...
the freedom you felt...</i>

394
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:20,550
<i>choosing to die in order
to protect your comrades.</i>

395
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:31,978
Didn't you say you wouldn't
let your friends die...?

396
00:29:32,933 --> 00:29:33,976
Naruto!

397
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:53,725
Those words...
"I'll never let my comrades die."

398
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:59,673
Now look around you...
and say it again!

399
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:08,782
As the bodies of your comrades
grow cold in your arms...

400
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,226
take in their deaths!

401
00:30:13,871 --> 00:30:16,981
Neji's...dead?!

402
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,529
<i>Hizashi, forgive me...</i>

403
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,364
<i>I let Neji--!</i>

404
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,534
This will continue...

405
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,955
And your flippant words and
ideology shall become lies.

406
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:36,073
This is the end result of
hope and ideals.

407
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,086
This is reality!

408
00:30:39,517 --> 00:30:40,518
Naruto...

409
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,924
What is there for you in this reality?

410
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:46,344
Your mother and father are gone,
as well as your master, Jiraiya.

411
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:49,013
And if you keep standing against us,

412
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:52,600
you'll continue to lose
your friends one by one.

413
00:30:54,527 --> 00:30:56,346
This shall become a world

414
00:30:56,371 --> 00:30:58,798
where no one who
acknowledges you will exist.

415
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:01,694
Obito...

416
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,988
The only thing that awaits you...

417
00:31:06,028 --> 00:31:09,367
is your worst nightmare,
which you know quite well!

418
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:14,455
Solitude!

419
00:31:22,772 --> 00:31:26,634
<i>You've become exactly
like the old me, Obito.</i>

420
00:31:27,148 --> 00:31:29,233
<i>Naruto will give up shortly...</i>

421
00:31:29,594 --> 00:31:32,389
<i>Which will break the will
of the Allied Forces.</i>

422
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:34,983
Why must you cling to reality?

423
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,772
Enough of this...
Now come join us, Naruto!

424
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,446
Brother Neji just said,

425
00:31:47,172 --> 00:31:50,550
that you hold more than
one life in your hands.

426
00:31:51,765 --> 00:31:53,505
Do you know what he meant?

427
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,783
"I'll never let my comrades die."

428
00:31:56,748 --> 00:32:00,752
Neither those words nor
the conviction behind them are lies!

429
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,339
Because he was able to successfully
store them in his heart,

430
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,007
and live them out to until the end!

431
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,634
Brother Neji did!

432
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,556
It's not just you, Naruto...

433
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:18,620
We all hold those words
and feelings in our hearts.

434
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:21,481
They're what bind our lives together...

435
00:32:23,045 --> 00:32:24,797
and make us comrades.

436
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:31,407
If we all give up and
discard those words and feelings,

437
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,661
Neji's final act will have been
for nothing.

438
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:39,624
And that is when...
your comrades truly die!

439
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,210
For you are then
no longer comrades.

440
00:32:43,388 --> 00:32:44,861
That's...how I feel.

441
00:32:49,153 --> 00:32:53,824
So, stand with me, Naruto.

442
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:58,434
Because never going back
on one's word...

443
00:32:58,928 --> 00:33:01,722
is my ninja way too!

444
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,733
<i>Naruto...</i>

445
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:10,446
<i>Lady Hinata...
is willing to die for you.</i>

446
00:33:11,175 --> 00:33:14,220
<i>So...you hold more...</i>

447
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,452
<i>...than one life!</i>

448
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:19,138
<i>Don't forget about me!</i>

449
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,289
I know.

450
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:21,958
I take my bonds seriously!

451
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,802
I'd never abandon my comrades!

452
00:33:24,827 --> 00:33:27,580
But in reality, Neji is...

453
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:30,049
<i>Stop your rambling!</i>

454
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:34,220
<i>I'll beat you up and take over
your body for good this time!</i>

455
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,556
<i>And did you also forget?</i>

456
00:33:37,167 --> 00:33:40,368
<i>Your mother and father did
the same thing Neji did</i>

457
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:41,903
<i>just after you were born.</i>

458
00:33:41,928 --> 00:33:44,664
<i>They sealed me,
their archenemy inside you,</i>

459
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,607
<i>and entrusted the future
to you and died.</i>

460
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:54,277
<i>Your life was already linked to
two others from the time you were born!</i>

461
00:33:56,422 --> 00:33:59,383
<i>Will he just stand back and
see how Naruto responds...?</i>

462
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,418
<i>It seems Naruto makes him uneasy.</i>

463
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,335
Enough!

464
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,465
Don't be hasty!

465
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,967
You're going to harm yourself
as well as Ten-Tails!

466
00:34:12,992 --> 00:34:14,118
I don't care!

467
00:34:14,557 --> 00:34:16,059
Ten-Tails hide is tough!

468
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,618
They're going to hit us!

469
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,519
Recharging completed!

470
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,313
<i>Be careful, Lord Bee!</i>

471
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:26,557
Go get 'em!

472
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:33,696
Take this!

473
00:34:49,592 --> 00:34:50,510
Lord Bee!

474
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,173
Don't go overboard!

475
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,248
There's no need to worry...

476
00:34:54,273 --> 00:34:56,817
Protecting the Alliance is my territory!

477
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,649
<i>That's right.</i>

478
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,818
<i>It wasn't just Mom and Dad.</i>

479
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,487
<i>Yeah...</i>

480
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:17,448
<i>It hasn't just been my life...</i>

481
00:35:18,071 --> 00:35:19,447
<i>up until now.</i>

482
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:32,171
Thanks, Hinata!

483
00:35:33,356 --> 00:35:36,067
It's all thanks to you
standing by my side.

484
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:39,929
<i>And Neji...</i>

485
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,578
<i>Thank you.</i>

486
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:53,734
<i>Naruto's hand is so big...</i>

487
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:56,529
<i>and strong, but most of all...</i>

488
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,534
Let's do this, Hinata!

489
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:03,680
Yeah!

490
00:36:05,907 --> 00:36:07,784
<i>It's comforting!</i>

491
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:27,268
That's Nine-Tails'—
I mean, Naruto's chakra!

492
00:36:28,121 --> 00:36:31,958
<i>Nice work transforming and
transferring my chakra, Naruto!</i>

493
00:36:32,508 --> 00:36:35,761
I've gotten the hang of it.
Work with me, Kurama!

494
00:36:36,201 --> 00:36:37,828
<i>That shinobi Nara,</i>

495
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:42,241
<i>he sure analyzed my chakra
exchange capabilities extensively.</i>

496
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,870
<i>We've kept them waiting a while.</i>

497
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,456
<i>A few shadow clones should be okay.</i>

498
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,624
Got it!

499
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,906
<i>A-Amazing...Naruto is able
to use this chakra...</i>

500
00:36:55,454 --> 00:36:56,789
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

501
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:00,968
You're late, Naruto!

502
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,511
Sorry!

503
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,393
Choji! Ino!

504
00:37:06,418 --> 00:37:07,419
O-Okay!

505
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,269
What...is this?

506
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,396
Are these calories?

507
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:14,815
Hey! Choji!

508
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:16,192
You're gaining weight again!

509
00:37:29,894 --> 00:37:34,434
That brat Naruto...Is he giving
them the Nine-Tails' chakra?

510
00:37:41,514 --> 00:37:42,834
<i>8 Trigrams Air Palm!</i>

511
00:37:46,383 --> 00:37:48,946
<i>I feel...my power surging!</i>

512
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,435
She did that with just an Air Palm?!

513
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:53,770
That girl...

514
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,900
She's gotten quite strong after
getting power from Naruto...

515
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,031
<i>Expansion Jutsu!</i>

516
00:38:08,179 --> 00:38:09,764
Shikamaru! Ino!

517
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,580
Are you ready?!

518
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:12,623
- Yeah!
- Okay!

519
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,125
Don't mock me!

520
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,961
What?!

521
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,504
- <i>Shadow Possession...</i>
- <i>Mind Transfer...</i>

522
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:19,505
- <i>Jutsu!</i>
- <i>Jutsu!</i>

523
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:24,792
<i>I'm in!</i>

524
00:38:25,086 --> 00:38:26,563
<i>Tsk...They did it again!</i>

525
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,307
<i>Damn you!</i>

526
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:44,947
They just keep on coming...

527
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:48,034
Now it's the Nara's Paralysis jutsu...

528
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,872
- Don't mess with the Nara Clan!
- Don't mess with the Nara Clan!

529
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,794
All right! We stopped him
in his tracks!

530
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:00,796
You can stop now, Ino!

531
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:03,632
Are you all right?!

532
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:04,842
Y-Yeah...

533
00:39:09,682 --> 00:39:11,476
Neji!

534
00:39:12,865 --> 00:39:14,639
Lee, stop crying!

535
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:19,623
Lee...

536
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,651
Lee...

537
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,279
So long as we don't abandon
Neji's convictions,

538
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:28,638
he will continue to live on,
connected inside all of us.

539
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,243
Let me share a little something
with you.

540
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,749
It's those connections that
made me what I am today!

541
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,836
You ought to know that bonds
can be powerful curses too!

542
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:43,589
Naruto...

543
00:39:44,304 --> 00:39:46,890
I was the one who once told you,

544
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,179
"I will never let my comrades die..."

545
00:39:52,114 --> 00:39:56,910
Those words are also
an admonition aimed at myself.

546
00:39:57,978 --> 00:40:01,148
I haven't been able to save
many comrades.

547
00:40:02,224 --> 00:40:05,310
Which is why I keep telling
myself this time, I will protect them.

548
00:40:06,339 --> 00:40:11,844
But then, I end up having to face
the fact that I couldn't once more.

549
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:17,415
I'll be confronting those wounds...
for the rest of my life.

550
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:21,001
But that's why we're ninja.

551
00:40:21,545 --> 00:40:23,964
We are those who endure.

552
00:40:25,196 --> 00:40:26,992
They'll never let you forget.

553
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:31,554
But it's those wounds that prove
your comrades live on inside here.

554
00:40:31,705 --> 00:40:34,041
Your friends are still alive
in here...

555
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:38,347
Friends that you create
inside a dream,

556
00:40:38,372 --> 00:40:40,624
so you can't get hurt,
aren't real.

557
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,401
That means you're just erasing
your real friends!

558
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:52,800
Curse or not, I want to keep
the real Neji right here.

559
00:40:55,619 --> 00:41:00,291
<i>The real Neji...right here...</i>

560
00:41:04,168 --> 00:41:05,169
<i>Gentle Fist!</i>

561
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:11,218
<i>It's no use, Lee.</i>

562
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,513
<i>No matter how hard you try,
you'll never defeat me.</i>

563
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:17,183
<i>That's just how things are.</i>

564
00:41:18,061 --> 00:41:19,654
<i>Look for a different rival.</i>

565
00:41:25,139 --> 00:41:27,225
<i>So you saw me lose.</i>

566
00:41:28,825 --> 00:41:30,118
<i>Hey, Lee, I used to think that</i>

567
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:33,866
<i>you couldn't change the fate
that was handed to you...</i>

568
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:38,787
<i>One day, I'll fight you for real,
so we can see which is greater,</i>

569
00:41:39,007 --> 00:41:42,719
<i>your Ferocious Fist
or my Gentle Fist.</i>

570
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:47,421
<i>But...I shall not lose so long
as my eyes are black.</i>

571
00:41:51,958 --> 00:41:55,670
<i>In your case, Neji, isn't it
the white of your eyes?</i>

572
00:41:56,347 --> 00:42:02,311
<i>Oh...Yeah...But anyway...
You have me as your rival.</i>

573
00:42:09,625 --> 00:42:13,125
It's a lot stronger than before,
and more of it than last time.

574
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,536
<i>There's something I want to confirm</i>

575
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:20,829
<i>regarding the intel from
the last battle sequence...</i>

576
00:42:21,561 --> 00:42:23,891
<i>Kakashi, you said that
the reason why</i>

577
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,960
<i>you were able to travel
through space time using Kamui,</i>

578
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:28,212
<i>plus pull Eight-Tails
in and out almost whole,</i>

579
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:32,174
<i>was thanks to receiving
Nine-Tails' chakra from Naruto, right?</i>

580
00:42:32,952 --> 00:42:33,953
<i>Yes...</i>

581
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:37,012
<i>To be more precise,</i>

582
00:42:37,037 --> 00:42:39,456
<i>I received that chakra
directly from Nine-Tails...</i>

583
00:42:39,825 --> 00:42:43,245
<i>In reference to your choice
of words, "Thanks to..."</i>

584
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:44,772
<i>How different was it</i>

585
00:42:44,797 --> 00:42:48,217
<i>compared to using Kamui
without Nine-Tails' chakra?</i>

586
00:42:48,762 --> 00:42:51,265
<i>Explain it to me in simple terms.</i>

587
00:42:52,322 --> 00:42:54,282
<i>I would say more than
three times the power.</i>

588
00:42:55,038 --> 00:42:57,708
<i>I couldn't really hurl things
that were very large</i>

589
00:42:57,971 --> 00:42:59,556
<i>or do it very often before that.</i>

590
00:43:05,454 --> 00:43:07,566
<i>Almost done?</i>

591
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:16,878
<i>Humph...Looks like things
have gone your way, Fourth Hokage!</i>

592
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:21,307
<i>Until now, the only one who was
able to link their chakra to mine</i>

593
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:24,310
<i>was Naruto because
he possesses Kushina's</i>

594
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:27,271
<i>and because he has been
my Jinchuriki for many years...</i>

595
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,440
<i>And Naruto has matured
to the point</i>

596
00:43:29,728 --> 00:43:33,284
<i>where he's skillful enough to sense
and transmute my chakra</i>

597
00:43:33,309 --> 00:43:38,106
<i>to be compatible with other shinobi
and then hand it over to them.</i>

598
00:43:38,591 --> 00:43:41,136
<i>Though I can also help
or use Naruto</i>

599
00:43:41,161 --> 00:43:43,679
<i>as an intermediary
to give my chakra to anyone...</i>

600
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:46,449
<i>The same exact way
you handed over</i>

601
00:43:46,474 --> 00:43:50,686
<i>and inserted your own chakra
into Naruto, Minato.</i>

602
00:43:50,816 --> 00:43:52,192
<i>He's already...</i>

603
00:43:52,217 --> 00:43:54,302
<i>Surpassed you both
a while ago now.</i>

604
00:43:55,771 --> 00:43:58,690
<i>The amount of chakra
he's linking and delivering</i>

605
00:43:58,715 --> 00:44:00,091
<i>is on a completely
different scale!</i>

606
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:04,350
<i>Kushina, Minato...
You're pathetic!</i>

607
00:44:04,893 --> 00:44:07,478
<i>You both pale in comparison
to your brat Naruto!</i>

608
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,776
<i>But this is probably...</i>

609
00:44:15,571 --> 00:44:20,284
<i>the power you wanted
to give to Naruto.</i>

610
00:44:22,334 --> 00:44:26,671
<i>Heh...I should probably lend
a little more power too.</i>

611
00:44:41,673 --> 00:44:44,467
<i>Damn it!
He's pushing me back hard!</i>

612
00:44:45,343 --> 00:44:47,971
Naruto, now's your chance!
Do it now!

613
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,397
<i>Tailed Beast Bomb!</i>

614
00:44:52,047 --> 00:44:53,090
<i>Beam of Light.</i>

615
00:44:53,654 --> 00:44:55,690
- <i>Eight Trigrams: Wall of Air Palm!</i>
- <i>Eight Trigrams: Wall of Air Palm!</i>

616
00:44:57,165 --> 00:44:59,751
- <i>Wind Style: Giant Casting Net!</i>
- <i>Wind Style: Giant Casting Net!</i>

617
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:15,462
I won't let Neji's death
be in vain!

618
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:21,260
A curse mark that doesn't
go away until you die...

619
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:24,847
A shinobi curse that Hyuga's main
and branch families gave rise to...

620
00:45:25,663 --> 00:45:28,999
An existence where one can
only await one's death inside a cage.

621
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:31,403
It's a nice analogy for
our current situation.

622
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:34,264
You're all exactly like that brat
who just died a pointless death.

623
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,025
Neji...

624
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,363
Neji's will...

625
00:45:48,751 --> 00:45:50,795
isn't...

626
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,417
dead yet!

627
00:46:04,445 --> 00:46:06,238
I'll take the right!

628
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:07,306
Gotcha!

629
00:46:08,773 --> 00:46:11,359
<i>Damn it! My shoulder's dislocated again!</i>

630
00:46:11,384 --> 00:46:12,171
<i>Gentle Fist!</i>

631
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:19,693
Go, Lee!

632
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:20,736
All right!

633
00:46:36,112 --> 00:46:38,614
Unlike you guys, I don't want...

634
00:46:40,169 --> 00:46:44,673
to sever any of my bonds...
or get them cut off!

635
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:47,513
We shouldn't have cut them.

636
00:46:54,556 --> 00:46:56,516
<i>Fire Style: Majestic Flower Flame!</i>

637
00:46:57,111 --> 00:46:58,904
<i>Fire Style: Bomb Blast Dance!</i>

638
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:18,451
We're safe!

639
00:47:18,476 --> 00:47:21,063
<i>If we didn't have
Naruto's Chakra Cloak,</i>

640
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:23,590
<i>we'd be crisper than a roast pig!</i>

641
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:36,562
The next round is coming!

642
00:47:47,328 --> 00:47:50,664
<i>Naruto's chakra has been protecting
everyone this whole time.</i>

643
00:47:51,207 --> 00:47:54,376
<i>Naruto, are you sure
you're okay to keep this going?</i>

644
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:06,503
Naruto, you're only fighting
defensively now,

645
00:48:06,528 --> 00:48:08,655
trying to protect everyone.

646
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:15,225
Is there any meaning to all of this?

647
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:17,269
<i>Are you all right, Naruto?</i>

648
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:20,772
<i>It's too much for you to control
the chakra that I gave you, all at once.</i>

649
00:48:21,281 --> 00:48:22,700
<i>You'll wear yourself out
in no time.</i>

650
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:26,075
<i>Also, it looks like Ten-Tails
is charging chakra,</i>

651
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,143
<i>so you'd better watch out!</i>

652
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:33,702
You're only growing weaker.

653
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:37,622
I don't think you'd understand,
since you want to be alone...

654
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:44,212
But having everyone by my side
makes me really, really happy!

655
00:48:45,747 --> 00:48:48,166
That alone gives me strength!

656
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:52,721
Did he run away?

657
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:57,343
If the pain of your comrades' deaths
is part of your bond...

658
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,943
then there's no need
to protect them, right?

659
00:49:01,273 --> 00:49:03,374
What the hell,
you quibbling bastard?!

660
00:49:03,498 --> 00:49:06,251
That's what I hate about you!

661
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:09,617
That's not what I‘m talking
about you, quibbling idiot!

662
00:49:09,873 --> 00:49:13,596
I'm saying I can endure any pain
if it involves my comrades.

663
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:16,495
It means I don't want
to give them up!

664
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:18,997
It might seem selfish of me...

665
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:27,617
But it's more painful for me to not
have any comrades in here!

666
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:32,928
<i>There's no mistake!</i>

667
00:49:33,807 --> 00:49:35,433
<i>This chakra is...</i>

668
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:38,913
<i>Hashirama!</i>

669
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,441
Dad! It's collapsing!

670
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:48,568
I can't hold it back any longer!

671
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:05,127
Damn it, it's repelling
this Mountain Jutsu

672
00:50:05,152 --> 00:50:06,570
enhanced with Naruto's chakra!

673
00:50:06,862 --> 00:50:10,657
There's no other jutsu
that can stop it, Dad!

674
00:50:14,703 --> 00:50:16,246
<i>Bad news, Naruto!</i>

675
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:19,057
<i>The Ten-Tails is planning to
do the Cataclysm!</i>

676
00:50:25,997 --> 00:50:28,277
It can't be controlled anymore,

677
00:50:28,302 --> 00:50:31,681
because you cut the link
between Ten-Tails and me.

678
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:35,907
Although I guess it's about time
I became its Jinchuriki.

679
00:50:56,964 --> 00:51:00,134
The real fun...
is just beginning!

680
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:06,308
<i>This time, I'll make
the Ten-Tails disappear!</i>

681
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:07,286
<i>Kamui!</i>

682
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:09,316
Looks like you were waiting
for your chance.

683
00:51:09,486 --> 00:51:12,072
But so was I, Kakashi.

684
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,362
Naruto, you take care
of things here!

685
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:16,698
Kakashi Sensei!

686
00:51:16,792 --> 00:51:18,878
<i>Here it comes! The Cataclysm!</i>

687
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:11,461
That should have cleaned
most of them out.

688
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:23,014
<i>Naruto protected us again.</i>

689
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:25,016
<i>Naruto...</i>

690
00:52:30,596 --> 00:52:32,390
Is that all you've got?

691
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:07,601
It's disappearing!

692
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:16,776
Nice try pretending to be tough, but
it seems you've reached your limit.

693
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:19,029
You've given me something
to look forward to...

694
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:22,073
but I think it's time
you made your exit.

695
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:30,165
Everyone! Let's join together
and fight as one!

696
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,000
- Right!
- Right!

697
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:33,084
Hinata!

698
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:34,628
Time for you to recover!

699
00:53:42,368 --> 00:53:43,494
<i>You guys...</i>

700
00:53:45,249 --> 00:53:46,625
Such a futile demonstration.

701
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:52,687
<i>Lightning Blade!</i>

702
00:54:02,338 --> 00:54:05,675
So there's still doubt
in your heart.

703
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,787
You've had several chances to
kill me if you really wanted to.

704
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:11,539
<i>One more blow!</i>

705
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:16,728
It's pathetic that
you feel compassion

706
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:18,713
towards an enemy
in the midst of fighting.

707
00:54:20,764 --> 00:54:22,307
Is it guilt?

708
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:25,720
Are you feeling remorse
over the fact that

709
00:54:26,082 --> 00:54:30,586
you couldn't protect Rin and
keep your promise to me?

710
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:39,109
Are you hoping that
I'll have a change of heart?

711
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,780
Obito...Let's stop this already!

712
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:48,034
Your dream long ago was
to become the Hokage...

713
00:54:49,496 --> 00:54:52,098
Naruto has the same dream.

714
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:57,002
Naruto's words are exactly
what you used to say in the past.

715
00:54:57,274 --> 00:54:59,359
You haven't realized it...

716
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:02,382
But you've been trying to merge
your past self with the current Naruto...

717
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:06,011
Hearing the old you
in Naruto's words.

718
00:55:08,165 --> 00:55:12,086
Is it because you secretly want
to be repudiated by your old self?

719
00:55:13,803 --> 00:55:16,347
I can't see you not understanding
Naruto's feelings!

720
00:55:17,402 --> 00:55:20,739
You can still go back...
to the person you once were!

721
00:55:27,888 --> 00:55:30,666
It's because I understand
Naruto's mind...

722
00:55:30,946 --> 00:55:33,198
That I want to hear it all...

723
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:36,540
And negate everything
that he does!

724
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:38,168
<i>Obito...</i>

725
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:40,754
By the way, let me tell you
one more thing.

726
00:55:41,104 --> 00:55:46,067
This guilt you feel towards me
is really presumptuous.

727
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:51,264
If you believe that I started
this war simply over you and Rin...

728
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:54,059
To call you misdirected,
would be an understatement!

729
00:55:59,705 --> 00:56:02,041
I know everything.

730
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:09,866
I know that Rin deliberately ran
into your Lightning Blade.

731
00:56:09,891 --> 00:56:11,935
That she chose to die.

732
00:56:16,414 --> 00:56:19,542
Back then, Rin had been kidnapped
by the Hidden Mist

733
00:56:19,782 --> 00:56:22,284
and forced to become
the Three Tails' Jinchuriki.

734
00:56:23,307 --> 00:56:27,375
You succeeded in rescuing Rin
and got her out...

735
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:31,137
But that was part of
the Hidden Mist's plan.

736
00:56:31,496 --> 00:56:33,537
They even pretended
to pursue you

737
00:56:33,562 --> 00:56:35,474
to get you home
to the Leaf quicker.

738
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:40,417
Once Rin made it back
to the Leaf,

739
00:56:40,442 --> 00:56:42,898
the Hidden Mist intended to make
the Three Tails rampage

740
00:56:42,923 --> 00:56:45,593
and attack the village.

741
00:56:58,119 --> 00:57:00,038
Rin realized this...

742
00:57:00,588 --> 00:57:04,024
And took advantage of the Lightning Blade
you aimed at the enemy...

743
00:57:05,468 --> 00:57:07,178
to commit suicide.

744
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:13,221
She made up her mind to die
at the hands of the one she loved.

745
00:57:13,581 --> 00:57:15,458
In order to protect
the Hidden Leaf.

746
00:57:15,828 --> 00:57:17,705
No matter what you say,

747
00:57:18,332 --> 00:57:22,351
to me, you're still an impostor
who couldn't protect Rin.

748
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:26,443
To me, Rin is someone
who wasn't supposed to die.

749
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:30,196
So Rin dead is also an impostor.

750
00:57:31,797 --> 00:57:33,966
Rin is Rin because she is alive!

751
00:57:35,092 --> 00:57:37,470
The things that created
all these circumstances...

752
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:41,291
The system of shinobi, village,
and the shinobi themselves...

753
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:45,128
What caused me to despair,
is this world itself.

754
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,714
This counterfeit world!

755
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:51,259
Remember Naruto's words?

756
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,512
That it's most painful

757
00:57:54,795 --> 00:57:56,755
not to have real comrades
inside one's heart?

758
00:57:56,931 --> 00:58:01,060
I quoted exactly what
you said long ago to him...

759
00:58:01,697 --> 00:58:05,576
I know the old you would have
resonated with that.

760
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,938
And I still believe
the current you, can as well-!

761
00:58:08,963 --> 00:58:09,964
Look!

762
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,823
There's nothing in my heart!

763
00:58:13,848 --> 00:58:16,517
I don't even feel pain anymore.

764
00:58:17,899 --> 00:58:20,110
Don't feel so guilty, Kakashi.

765
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:24,831
This hole was opened
by this hellish world.

766
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:29,088
In the past,
all I felt was pain here.

767
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:31,049
What's the meaning in that?

768
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:33,510
So I abandoned everything.

769
00:58:33,872 --> 00:58:37,010
You've been suffering all this time,
haven't you?

770
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,684
As you stood at Rin's grave...
and at my grave.

771
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:45,382
Kakashi...

772
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:47,273
Enough already.

773
00:58:48,109 --> 00:58:50,403
You don't have to
suffer anymore.

774
00:58:51,377 --> 00:58:52,837
Rin is here.

775
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,531
<i>I love you, Kakashi.</i>

776
00:58:55,629 --> 00:58:59,007
Along with your ideal version of me.

777
00:58:59,032 --> 00:59:01,159
<i>I'm gonna be Hokage!</i>

778
00:59:01,722 --> 00:59:03,473
You can wish for
whatever you want...

779
00:59:03,875 --> 00:59:07,545
You can have anything you
desire in this genjutsu World.

780
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:10,838
The hole in your heart
can be filled immediately.

781
00:59:13,110 --> 00:59:14,403
Rin is gone.

782
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:17,345
You are still alive!

783
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:20,354
Do you really think
that something like this

784
00:59:20,379 --> 00:59:23,090
can fill that hole in your heart?

785
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:27,063
Don't erase the memories
of the real Rin!

786
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:31,943
Rin sacrificed herself to protect
and save the village!

787
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:35,822
You can try and fill that hole
with delusions all by yourself...

788
00:59:37,005 --> 00:59:38,882
But that hole will never be filled!

789
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:42,370
What's your issue with
a genjutsu World?

790
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:44,706
Reality is cruel.

791
00:59:45,515 --> 00:59:47,767
This hole is only going to get bigger.

792
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:52,171
Things don't always
go the way want them.

793
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,507
Nor does help always
get there in time.

794
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:57,594
Just like how it was with me!

795
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:01,927
Just like how I couldn't
get there in time!

796
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:05,768
Wouldn't you agree, Kakashi?

797
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:09,981
How are you going to seal
this hole by staying in this world?!

798
01:00:28,991 --> 01:00:30,409
It's transforming again!

799
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:33,630
<i>No, it's only reverting
to its original form.</i>

800
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:36,549
<i>That was only its attack form.</i>

801
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:39,302
<i>However...</i>

802
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:42,930
<i>It's just one stage away
from its final transformation.</i>

803
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:47,810
<i>Naruto's still recovering,</i>

804
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:49,729
<i>and Nine-Tails is
infusing chakra right now.</i>

805
01:00:49,915 --> 01:00:52,125
<i>Right now, it's up to us, Bee!</i>

806
01:00:52,551 --> 01:00:55,846
Right. We'll show everyone the way!

807
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:57,612
<i>Listen to me, Bee...</i>

808
01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:01,952
<i>If we let it undergo
its final transformation, we've lost.</i>

809
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:04,035
<i>We must stop it now!</i>

810
01:01:16,091 --> 01:01:18,468
<i>Ten-Tails isn't holding back...</i>

811
01:01:19,317 --> 01:01:21,027
<i>It probably got impatient</i>

812
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:23,846
<i>after seeing the same Tailed Beasts
inside Naruto!</i>

813
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:27,517
It's getting bigger and bigger.

814
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:30,561
I-Is it after Naruto?

815
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:36,025
Honestly, how're we going
to stop that thing

816
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:37,593
without Naruto's chakra?

817
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:49,455
We can't waver after
coming this far!

818
01:01:50,557 --> 01:01:54,060
Naruto is putting everything
into doing what has to be done.

819
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:56,587
Yeah. He's been going
out of his way

820
01:01:56,948 --> 01:01:58,106
even to protect shinobi like us...

821
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,668
That's not what
I was talking about!

822
01:02:00,888 --> 01:02:01,930
He's told us that

823
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:05,096
he considers all of us his comrades
from the bottom of his heart.

824
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,557
I'll fully heal Naruto!

825
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:12,145
We have to do
what we have to do!

826
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:15,273
If we're going to die anyway,

827
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:17,442
we might as well go down...

828
01:02:19,393 --> 01:02:21,896
fighting to the best of our abilities!

829
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:27,910
Ino!

830
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:30,663
I want you to link me
with someone!

831
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:32,582
You've got a plan, haven't you?

832
01:02:32,839 --> 01:02:34,466
I knew you would
come through, Shikamaru!

833
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:37,170
Isn't there anything
we can do, Dad?

834
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:39,088
I don't have enough chakra.

835
01:02:39,161 --> 01:02:41,288
<i>Kitsuchi! Please hear me out!</i>

836
01:02:42,411 --> 01:02:44,496
<i>You're Shikaku's child...</i>

837
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:47,513
<i>Teach me the signs to
an easy Earth Style Barrier</i>

838
01:02:47,538 --> 01:02:50,709
<i>that even non-Stone ninja
can perform!</i>

839
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:55,354
<i>One that anyone could perform
would be too weak!</i>

840
01:02:55,557 --> 01:02:56,600
<i>It would be better to...</i>

841
01:02:56,814 --> 01:02:59,984
<i>No, it's crucial that
everyone be able to produce it.</i>

842
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:02,487
<i>If the enemy has quality,
we've got quantity.</i>

843
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:05,072
<i>But these walls will
be blown away quickly.</i>

844
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:06,590
<i>Even if they are</i>

845
01:03:06,615 --> 01:03:09,660
<i>if we keep creating more,
they'll act like a shield.</i>

846
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:12,079
<i>We're going to slow
that thing's momentum</i>

847
01:03:12,104 --> 01:03:14,857
<i>with many weak walls rather than
try to stop it with one powerful one!</i>

848
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:18,669
<i>Of course, I intend to have
all of you from the Hidden Stone</i>

849
01:03:18,694 --> 01:03:21,321
<i>build me a super wall as well...</i>

850
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:26,052
<i>I see...Your idea might be
worth a try.</i>

851
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:29,013
<i>All right,
these are the hand signs!</i>

852
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:30,515
<i>Before we start...</i>

853
01:03:31,665 --> 01:03:32,749
<i>Master Bee!</i>

854
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:36,229
<i>While everyone is
building barriers,</i>

855
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:38,831
<i>I want you to bombard that thing
with Tailed Beast Bombs</i>

856
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:40,858
<i>to shift its trajectory upwards.</i>

857
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:43,694
Ino...

858
01:03:45,296 --> 01:03:47,298
Next, I want you to link me

859
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:49,283
with every shinobi here
on the battlefield.

860
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:50,785
Can you do it?

861
01:03:50,868 --> 01:03:53,287
Doesn't matter, I will do it!

862
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:04,715
I may be trash as a shinobi,
but I've learned a few things.

863
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:18,813
The hole in one's heart gets filled
by others around you.

864
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:23,276
Friends won't flock to
someone who abandons

865
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:27,572
the memory of his friends
and gives up on the world...

866
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:29,740
Just because things don't go
the way he wants them to.

867
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,370
That won't help fill
the hole in your heart.

868
01:04:35,346 --> 01:04:39,600
And people don't help those
who run away and do nothing.

869
01:04:41,396 --> 01:04:45,108
As long as you don't give up,
there will always be salvation.

870
01:05:01,522 --> 01:05:03,274
No matter what you do...

871
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:09,155
It's over.

872
01:05:10,567 --> 01:05:12,736
- <i>Earth Style Barrier!</i>
- <i>Earth Style Barrier!</i>

873
01:05:13,481 --> 01:05:14,779
<i>Here it comes, Bee!</i>

874
01:05:14,952 --> 01:05:16,162
Let's go!

875
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:20,458
<i>Its power is off the charts!</i>

876
01:05:29,751 --> 01:05:32,028
<i>It's more powerful than I thought.</i>

877
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:33,054
<i>At this rate...</i>

878
01:05:38,044 --> 01:05:39,421
<i>The last barrier...!</i>

879
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:46,484
Lord Bee!

880
01:05:49,689 --> 01:05:51,774
All your tedious whitewashing!

881
01:05:52,231 --> 01:05:55,635
One can only achieve true happiness
by abandoning reality

882
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:58,788
and ridding yourself of
the memories of your comrades!

883
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:05,086
In the ninja world, those who
break the rules are scum.

884
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:11,258
But...those who abandon
their friends are worse than scum.

885
01:06:12,365 --> 01:06:17,620
And...those who don't care
about their friends' feelings...

886
01:06:19,158 --> 01:06:21,201
are even worse scum!

887
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:34,365
I won't abandon my memory
of the old you.

888
01:06:36,143 --> 01:06:39,980
Even if it's the current you
who's repudiating it.

889
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:43,833
Am I late?

890
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:45,626
Nope.

891
01:06:46,098 --> 01:06:47,975
Right on time, Dad!

892
01:06:49,065 --> 01:06:49,985
Who...?

893
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:00,141
My name's Minato Namikaze.

894
01:07:00,855 --> 01:07:02,190
Brace for an impending explosion.

895
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:08,190
What is that?

896
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:09,841
What?

897
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:14,655
I sent Ten-Tails' attack
back toward the sea.

898
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,160
- What's that?!
- Is it an attack?!

899
01:07:19,243 --> 01:07:20,244
Watch out!

900
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:22,872
What the hell's going on?!

901
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:25,541
What just happened?!

902
01:07:29,027 --> 01:07:31,856
That shock wave came
out of nowhere!

903
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:32,992
What's with that?!

904
01:07:33,017 --> 01:07:34,310
Stop complaining!

905
01:07:34,675 --> 01:07:37,261
We're lucky that
we got off that easily!

906
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,785
<i>He has Reanimation eyes!</i>

907
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:47,313
Relax. I'm an ally.

908
01:07:48,272 --> 01:07:50,665
Thanks for healing Naruto!

909
01:07:51,395 --> 01:07:52,563
Are you...

910
01:07:53,468 --> 01:07:54,845
Naruto's girlfriend?

911
01:07:55,123 --> 01:07:56,249
Huh?

912
01:07:56,274 --> 01:07:57,776
Hmm...

913
01:07:58,370 --> 01:07:59,685
Uh-huh...Yeah!

914
01:08:00,126 --> 01:08:01,499
I suppose you could say that.

915
01:08:01,524 --> 01:08:03,109
You keep quiet!

916
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:06,957
Don't waste your energy talking!

917
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:11,545
You're supposed to be healing me,
but I just suffered more damage...

918
01:08:11,570 --> 01:08:13,905
I'll heal the extra damage too!

919
01:08:16,998 --> 01:08:19,526
<i>She reminds me a little of Kushina...</i>

920
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:23,224
Please go easy on my son.

921
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,395
So, why did this happen so suddenly?

922
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:30,314
It seems like you knew.

923
01:08:31,687 --> 01:08:33,898
I sensed his chakra when
I was in Nine-Tails Mode.

924
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:36,677
The others should be arriving soon...

925
01:08:38,508 --> 01:08:39,467
Something's coming!

926
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:45,496
Minato, you're as fast as ever!

927
01:08:46,449 --> 01:08:48,142
Lord Third Hokage?!

928
01:08:48,584 --> 01:08:49,419
And also...

929
01:08:49,544 --> 01:08:50,545
That's the...!

930
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:52,670
Fourth...

931
01:08:53,328 --> 01:08:55,789
You're better
at teleporting than I am!

932
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:58,968
All right, let's do this!

933
01:08:59,592 --> 01:09:00,593
No way!

934
01:09:01,131 --> 01:09:02,235
I don't believe it...

935
01:09:08,816 --> 01:09:12,653
I've been waiting for you, Hashirama!

936
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,317
I'll deal with you later!

937
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,321
I have to stop
the Ten-Tails first!

938
01:09:22,074 --> 01:09:23,951
He hasn't changed a bit.

939
01:09:24,849 --> 01:09:26,809
We're never on the same page.

940
01:09:27,666 --> 01:09:28,622
After all...

941
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:32,293
It's charging towards us...

942
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:35,921
My fellow Hokage, let's go!

943
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:44,889
Second and Third,
stand in front of me.

944
01:09:46,506 --> 01:09:49,467
<i>That's exactly like Naruto's...</i>

945
01:09:50,644 --> 01:09:53,772
<i>I never imagined
Minato would too!</i>

946
01:09:54,367 --> 01:09:55,618
See! You see!

947
01:09:55,643 --> 01:09:57,979
Isn't my dad awesome?!

948
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,946
<i>I know that better than you!</i>

949
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:05,492
<i>After all, he's the one who
split me up before sealing me away!</i>

950
01:10:08,412 --> 01:10:10,623
Have you already placed
your markers?

951
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:11,582
Yes.

952
01:10:11,665 --> 01:10:14,168
You're quick at striking too!

953
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:23,159
He vanished!

954
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:27,473
Let's go!

955
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:28,891
<i>Ninja Art:</i>

956
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:32,228
- <i>Four Crimson Ray Formation!</i>
- <i>Four Crimson Ray Formation!</i>

957
01:10:43,258 --> 01:10:45,802
And...I'll just add on...

958
01:10:46,784 --> 01:10:49,745
<i>Sage Art: Gracious Deity Gates!</i>

959
01:10:57,586 --> 01:10:59,129
<i>Ten Seals!</i>

960
01:11:04,735 --> 01:11:05,861
A red barrier?!

961
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:09,431
It's said to be dozens of times
more powerful

962
01:11:09,456 --> 01:11:11,541
than the Four Purple
Flames Formation!

963
01:11:11,566 --> 01:11:13,244
It's a barrier that requires

964
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,980
four Hokage-class shinobi
together to create!

965
01:11:19,307 --> 01:11:21,518
It won't be able to move
so easily now.

966
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:35,664
You sure took your time
getting here, Sasuke.

967
01:11:39,019 --> 01:11:41,017
Sasu...ke?

968
01:11:43,173 --> 01:11:44,216
Is that you, Sakura?

969
01:11:45,617 --> 01:11:47,577
S-Sasuke! Why?!

970
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:54,720
S-Sasuke!

971
01:11:54,770 --> 01:11:56,147
Hey, Ino! Stop!

972
01:11:56,603 --> 01:11:57,855
He's an enemy!

973
01:11:58,272 --> 01:12:01,483
Ino...You better keep your distance!

974
01:12:05,181 --> 01:12:07,850
You're all still as noisy as ever!

975
01:12:10,081 --> 01:12:11,897
Why the hell are you here, bastard?!

976
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:16,457
Why are you here, Sasuke?

977
01:12:17,899 --> 01:12:19,401
A lot of things have happened.

978
01:12:19,771 --> 01:12:22,599
I've decided to protect Leaf Village.

979
01:12:23,730 --> 01:12:26,965
And then, I'll...

980
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:31,242
become Hokage.

981
01:12:39,357 --> 01:12:40,358
What?!

982
01:12:40,981 --> 01:12:42,941
You can't just come back
all of a sudden

983
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:44,943
and crack a lame joke like that,
you rogue ninja!

984
01:12:45,335 --> 01:12:47,588
Do you even know
what it means to be Hokage?

985
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:52,117
I don't know what happened to you,
but that's not possible.

986
01:12:52,426 --> 01:12:54,970
Do you even realize
what you're saying?

987
01:12:54,995 --> 01:12:58,791
Do you think we can just forget
all the things you've done?

988
01:12:59,249 --> 01:13:01,960
Yeah, I realize you probably can't.

989
01:13:02,726 --> 01:13:03,837
But...

990
01:13:04,087 --> 01:13:07,590
it doesn't matter
what you guys think of me.

991
01:13:09,609 --> 01:13:12,653
All of the previous Kage created
these current circumstances.

992
01:13:13,110 --> 01:13:16,780
So I will become Hokage
and change the village.

993
01:13:19,828 --> 01:13:21,121
<i>You don't become Hokage</i>

994
01:13:21,146 --> 01:13:23,148
<i>in order to be acknowledged
by the village.</i>

995
01:13:23,857 --> 01:13:25,776
<i>The one who is acknowledged
by everyone,</i>

996
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:27,011
<i>is the one who becomes Hokage.</i>

997
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:31,479
<i>I leave Sasuke to you.</i>

998
01:13:37,287 --> 01:13:38,594
<i>Leave it to me.</i>

999
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:47,965
I'm going to be Hokage!

1000
01:13:49,341 --> 01:13:52,261
I'm glad there's so much interest
in becoming Hokage...

1001
01:13:52,344 --> 01:13:53,929
But you guys are
taking too much time!

1002
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:55,931
Start infusing chakra right now!

1003
01:13:57,024 --> 01:13:59,688
We'll take down Ten-Tails
with an all-out attack!

1004
01:14:01,895 --> 01:14:03,981
Thanks for healing me, Sakura!

1005
01:14:04,847 --> 01:14:06,807
Now it's your turn to get some rest.

1006
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:08,819
Let's go, Sasuke!

1007
01:14:15,061 --> 01:14:15,901
Sakura?

1008
01:14:15,926 --> 01:14:17,887
So do you see me as
some sort of weak woman

1009
01:14:18,351 --> 01:14:20,247
who can't keep up with you two?

1010
01:14:21,081 --> 01:14:23,500
Do you think Lady Tsunade
would be the only one

1011
01:14:23,861 --> 01:14:26,405
out of the Legendary Sannin
to inadequately train her student?

1012
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:29,131
I'm almost there...

1013
01:14:30,218 --> 01:14:32,220
I'll be at full capacity in a little bit.

1014
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:34,938
Then I can output my true power.

1015
01:14:36,265 --> 01:14:38,559
Just like you,
I'm a member of Team 7...

1016
01:14:38,584 --> 01:14:40,753
and I'm a student of
one of the Legendary Sannin!

1017
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:51,028
Okay then!

1018
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:56,325
Team 7 is finally back!

1019
01:14:57,954 --> 01:15:00,415
Let's go, Sakura! Sasuke!

1020
01:15:00,954 --> 01:15:01,955
Right!

1021
01:15:02,127 --> 01:15:03,034
Yeah!

1022
01:15:04,124 --> 01:15:06,877
That sight sure brings
back memories, doesn't it, Shikamaru?

1023
01:15:07,927 --> 01:15:12,382
Well, if he's willing to
help us defeat the enemy,

1024
01:15:12,407 --> 01:15:13,970
I won't turn him away.

1025
01:15:14,890 --> 01:15:16,475
Even tho' I don't want to accept him...

1026
01:15:16,903 --> 01:15:19,906
It's been a long time since
our class has been back together.

1027
01:15:20,177 --> 01:15:22,526
I haven't felt like this
since the Chunin Exam.

1028
01:15:22,551 --> 01:15:24,344
I'm going to become Hokage!

1029
01:15:24,436 --> 01:15:26,355
Hey, are you guys even listening?!

1030
01:15:26,749 --> 01:15:30,961
Kiba, no one's paying attention
right now...and it's pitiful.

1031
01:15:31,568 --> 01:15:32,569
Stop it.

1032
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:35,989
It's because the impact of
Sasuke's sudden appearance

1033
01:15:36,568 --> 01:15:39,284
and his declaration to
become Hokage are much too great.

1034
01:15:40,327 --> 01:15:42,955
Kiba, I heard you!

1035
01:15:43,747 --> 01:15:46,250
We should all aspire
to become Hokage!

1036
01:15:48,919 --> 01:15:53,131
Let's show them
what we're made of, ya know!

1037
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:55,050
Wait a minute!

1038
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:56,051
Huh?!

1039
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:59,221
It's that thing again!

1040
01:16:09,606 --> 01:16:10,816
It wants to break the barrier!

1041
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:12,595
Fellow previous Hokage!

1042
01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:14,914
Please re-focus and
prepare yourselves!

1043
01:16:14,994 --> 01:16:16,204
We know that!

1044
01:16:17,447 --> 01:16:18,949
Now then...

1045
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:39,094
It held up!

1046
01:16:40,295 --> 01:16:41,882
What an amazing barrier…

1047
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:44,308
To be able to keep that thing out…

1048
01:16:45,192 --> 01:16:46,193
Where's the Ten-Tails?!

1049
01:16:56,733 --> 01:17:00,873
That Ten-Tails, he hit himself!

1050
01:17:02,492 --> 01:17:04,703
It's not some simple barrier!

1051
01:17:06,091 --> 01:17:07,175
Wow…

1052
01:17:07,475 --> 01:17:10,750
The previous Hokage were
truly amazing people!

1053
01:17:11,357 --> 01:17:13,170
Looks like they weren't just all talk.

1054
01:17:13,503 --> 01:17:15,881
<i>Wood Style: Wood Clone Jutsu!</i>

1055
01:17:19,384 --> 01:17:21,626
I'll make entry points
on all four sides of the barrier,

1056
01:17:21,651 --> 01:17:24,182
so shinobi can go in and out!

1057
01:17:24,389 --> 01:17:25,474
Follow me!

1058
01:17:25,829 --> 01:17:27,706
All right! Go!

1059
01:17:27,778 --> 01:17:28,630
Right!

1060
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:32,773
It's not over yet!

1061
01:17:33,448 --> 01:17:34,949
<i>Sage Arts: Gracious Deity Gates!</i>

1062
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:37,611
<i>Head Seal!</i>

1063
01:17:45,443 --> 01:17:47,529
Now then, time to deal with you.

1064
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:49,886
Sorry to keep you waiting, Madara…

1065
01:17:50,993 --> 01:17:51,914
No...

1066
01:17:56,963 --> 01:17:58,674
A clone is no fun.

1067
01:17:59,257 --> 01:18:01,009
I'll wait for the real one
to show up.

1068
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:05,055
Now!

1069
01:18:16,154 --> 01:18:17,364
Fission Beings?

1070
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:19,986
It's trying to keep us away
from its real body!

1071
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:31,581
<i>Please take me on as your apprentice!</i>

1072
01:18:35,001 --> 01:18:37,212
<i>First and foremost,
you are my disciple.</i>

1073
01:18:37,754 --> 01:18:40,215
<i>A kunoichi who will inherit
the power of the Legendary Sannin.</i>

1074
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:42,076
<i>And…Sakura Haruno…</i>

1075
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:46,221
<i>You are also the disciple
of the Fifth Hokage!</i>

1076
01:18:48,003 --> 01:18:49,004
And...

1077
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:52,519
I just now reached full capacity.
And I can finally unleash it!

1078
01:19:02,843 --> 01:19:05,054
Cha!

1079
01:19:07,033 --> 01:19:08,827
What monster strength!

1080
01:19:09,134 --> 01:19:11,178
It might just be greater than Tsuna's!

1081
01:19:11,855 --> 01:19:14,941
<i>Amassing chakra at a continuous rate
over three years…</i>

1082
01:19:15,414 --> 01:19:17,749
<i>requiring extremely
delicate chakra control.</i>

1083
01:19:18,295 --> 01:19:21,298
<i>The 100 Healings Mark
that I couldn't even achieve.</i>

1084
01:19:22,493 --> 01:19:25,162
And I have no need to keep up
a youthful appearance!

1085
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:34,186
<i>Wind Style…</i>

1086
01:19:34,519 --> 01:19:35,520
<i>Inferno Style…</i>

1087
01:19:37,147 --> 01:19:38,982
- <i>Rasen Shuriken!</i>
- <i>Flame Control!</i>

1088
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:47,491
Sasuke!

1089
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:50,118
Um…

1090
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:53,288
I'm here too…Sakura!

1091
01:19:53,538 --> 01:19:55,624
Don't drag us down, Naruto.

1092
01:19:55,874 --> 01:19:58,340
He's right! Keep complaining and

1093
01:19:58,365 --> 01:20:00,867
I'll just grab the title
of Hokage away from you!

1094
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:02,130
Huh?

1095
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:04,174
Not you too, Sakura?!

1096
01:20:04,345 --> 01:20:06,264
This time, we fight with
our backs to each other!

1097
01:20:17,550 --> 01:20:21,054
<i>So this is how Nine-Tails
chakra looks under control...</i>

1098
01:20:22,089 --> 01:20:25,384
<i>A new Sharingan…
with black flames…</i>

1099
01:20:26,457 --> 01:20:27,819
<i>That Naruto…</i>

1100
01:20:28,202 --> 01:20:30,538
<i>He's even mastered changing
the Rasengan's nature...</i>

1101
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:35,013
Hey, Team 8! Let's go too!

1102
01:20:35,038 --> 01:20:36,998
We can't let Team 7 show us up!

1103
01:20:36,998 --> 01:20:37,813
Right!

1104
01:20:38,393 --> 01:20:41,814
I've worked out
a new jutsu too, Naruto!

1105
01:20:42,565 --> 01:20:45,443
Don't think you're the only one
with this jutsu!

1106
01:20:46,619 --> 01:20:48,495
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

1107
01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:50,659
Did you just say Shadow Clone Jutsu?

1108
01:20:50,686 --> 01:20:52,488
All you did was make one clone!

1109
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:54,140
Back in the day,
I could make a lot more...

1110
01:20:54,165 --> 01:20:55,458
Just watch!

1111
01:20:55,575 --> 01:20:58,953
There may be just one,
but he's three times stronger!

1112
01:20:59,274 --> 01:21:00,316
Come on, Akamaru!

1113
01:21:03,316 --> 01:21:04,860
We're gonna attack the enemy!

1114
01:21:05,443 --> 01:21:06,670
<i>Inuzuka Style:</i>

1115
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:08,113
<i>Man-Beast Team
Transformation Combo!</i>

1116
01:21:09,105 --> 01:21:10,708
<i>Three-Headed Wolf!</i>

1117
01:21:14,077 --> 01:21:18,498
Sasuke's joke was disgusting.
But it's revving me up!

1118
01:21:22,168 --> 01:21:23,378
<i>Tail Chasing…</i>

1119
01:21:23,962 --> 01:21:25,547
<i>Rotating Fang!</i>

1120
01:21:45,315 --> 01:21:46,442
<i>Parasitic Gigantic Beetle...</i>

1121
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:53,450
<i>Infestation!</i>

1122
01:21:58,163 --> 01:22:00,916
Gross! What are those?!

1123
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:03,376
Parasitic Gigantic Beetles…

1124
01:22:03,422 --> 01:22:06,217
If you mistake the amount
of chakra to give them,

1125
01:22:06,379 --> 01:22:08,840
they'll devour your flesh
and undergo rapid growth.

1126
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:12,177
They are beetles
that are difficult to nurture.

1127
01:22:12,552 --> 01:22:15,305
<i>Two Palms! Four Palms! Eight Palms!</i>

1128
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:16,289
<i>Sixteen Palms!</i>

1129
01:22:16,514 --> 01:22:17,766
<i>Thirty-Two Palms!</i>

1130
01:22:21,436 --> 01:22:24,564
<i>I guess this is still my limit...</i>

1131
01:22:24,589 --> 01:22:25,715
<i>No such thing.</i>

1132
01:22:26,858 --> 01:22:30,236
<i>But I'm not like you, Neji…</i>

1133
01:22:30,403 --> 01:22:31,738
<i>If you set limits on yourself,</i>

1134
01:22:31,763 --> 01:22:33,557
<i>you'll never be able
to catch up to him…</i>

1135
01:22:34,824 --> 01:22:39,913
<i>Overcome your limits,
fearlessly take a giant leap forward.</i>

1136
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:41,623
<i>That's the…</i>

1137
01:22:54,678 --> 01:22:56,680
<i>Sixty-Four Palms!</i>

1138
01:22:59,265 --> 01:23:01,559
<i>...trick to achieve the Sixty-Four Palms.</i>

1139
01:23:05,021 --> 01:23:08,483
<i>Naruto is always striving
to get ahead.</i>

1140
01:23:08,483 --> 01:23:09,484
<i>And I…</i>

1141
01:23:13,905 --> 01:23:16,950
<i>...want to keep standing
by Naruto forever!</i>

1142
01:23:17,951 --> 01:23:19,347
This time, I'll proceed to

1143
01:23:19,372 --> 01:23:21,249
Eight Trigrams
Sixty-Four Palms like this!

1144
01:23:23,123 --> 01:23:26,501
<i>So I'll continuously
move forward as well!</i>

1145
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:28,670
Come on, Team 10!

1146
01:23:28,753 --> 01:23:31,131
Let's attack with
the Ino-Shika-Cho Combination!

1147
01:23:31,548 --> 01:23:33,091
Formation E!

1148
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:35,760
This isn't the Chunin Exam.

1149
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:38,138
We're not competing against
the other teams.

1150
01:23:38,599 --> 01:23:40,017
This is war…

1151
01:23:40,287 --> 01:23:42,539
But we want to show them
what we're made of, right?

1152
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:44,519
<i>Expansion Jutsu!</i>

1153
01:23:48,606 --> 01:23:50,358
<i>Shadow Grasping Jutsu!</i>

1154
01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:09,753
<i>Twenty-five enemy signatures
picked up and locked on!</i>

1155
01:24:10,628 --> 01:24:12,088
<i>Sensory Relay!</i>

1156
01:24:19,804 --> 01:24:22,265
<i>Human Boulder Yo-Yo!</i>

1157
01:24:39,173 --> 01:24:40,633
I'm going to expand even more.

1158
01:24:40,992 --> 01:24:42,744
Can you handle more weight?

1159
01:24:42,827 --> 01:24:45,580
Yeah...You're still light.

1160
01:24:45,605 --> 01:24:48,483
And besides, this isn't quite flashy
enough to impress.

1161
01:24:48,508 --> 01:24:51,135
What? Who's being
super competitive now?

1162
01:24:52,089 --> 01:24:55,134
Actually, I'm technically on
Team 7 too, you know...

1163
01:24:58,676 --> 01:25:00,970
I'll quickly attack
the main body from the air!

1164
01:25:02,254 --> 01:25:03,255
Sai!

1165
01:25:10,384 --> 01:25:11,385
Sai!

1166
01:25:16,611 --> 01:25:17,732
Are you all right?!

1167
01:25:18,176 --> 01:25:19,010
Yes…

1168
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:21,783
It's no good!

1169
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:23,952
The enemy keeps
increasing in numbers.

1170
01:25:24,994 --> 01:25:25,995
Not only that…

1171
01:25:26,037 --> 01:25:27,247
Some are huge!

1172
01:25:27,705 --> 01:25:30,415
<i>These big ones...sure are heavy!</i>

1173
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:34,796
Naruto…

1174
01:25:34,921 --> 01:25:37,006
Can you share your chakra
with everyone again?

1175
01:25:37,423 --> 01:25:38,675
I can't right now!

1176
01:25:38,925 --> 01:25:41,928
Kurama hasn't finished
amassing chakra yet!

1177
01:25:43,746 --> 01:25:45,248
In order to take down
the main body,

1178
01:25:45,364 --> 01:25:49,441
we need to mow down
the big ones and slip past them.

1179
01:25:50,228 --> 01:25:52,564
The distance is too great to
make a single leap for it.

1180
01:25:53,706 --> 01:25:56,876
We also need time to weave signs
and repel the enemy's attacks.

1181
01:25:58,236 --> 01:26:00,071
Without your chakra, Naruto,

1182
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:01,990
it's very likely
we'll suffer heavy casualties.

1183
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:04,075
And the Medical Corps
can't come up to the front.

1184
01:26:07,662 --> 01:26:09,789
Mow down and slip past?

1185
01:26:09,789 --> 01:26:11,166
Easy.

1186
01:26:11,916 --> 01:26:14,335
This guy has the power to
clear the distance in a single leap

1187
01:26:14,377 --> 01:26:16,880
and repel enemy attacks.

1188
01:26:17,338 --> 01:26:20,044
I can now stay nearby and

1189
01:26:20,069 --> 01:26:23,095
heal anyone who suffers
serious injuries at all times.

1190
01:26:23,944 --> 01:26:25,445
- <i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>
- <i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

1191
01:26:42,989 --> 01:26:43,990
Huh?

1192
01:26:44,407 --> 01:26:45,408
Wait…

1193
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:47,076
This color…

1194
01:26:48,099 --> 01:26:49,225
You're…

1195
01:26:49,792 --> 01:26:51,293
Gamakichi!

1196
01:26:52,332 --> 01:26:55,126
Pop was tied up with
some negotiations,

1197
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:56,836
so I came in his place.

1198
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:58,129
You surprised?!

1199
01:26:58,213 --> 01:26:59,923
No! No!

1200
01:27:00,086 --> 01:27:03,339
But man, you sure got big
all of a sudden!

1201
01:27:03,411 --> 01:27:05,371
I'm more shocked than
I was about Akamaru!

1202
01:27:05,678 --> 01:27:08,681
You humans grow too slow, that's all.

1203
01:27:08,879 --> 01:27:11,159
Anyway, what's up?

1204
01:27:11,244 --> 01:27:12,245
Right!

1205
01:27:12,477 --> 01:27:14,437
See the gigantic guy way
in the back?

1206
01:27:14,712 --> 01:27:16,542
Could you get me closer to it
with a big leap?

1207
01:27:17,774 --> 01:27:19,984
You mean the biggest one
over there?

1208
01:27:20,109 --> 01:27:21,110
Yeah.

1209
01:27:30,995 --> 01:27:33,498
Lord Sasuke, your desire?

1210
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:36,542
I need you to just keep
advancing forward.

1211
01:27:37,293 --> 01:27:39,254
I'll get the real body in the back!

1212
01:27:40,282 --> 01:27:41,617
Sakura dear!

1213
01:27:41,923 --> 01:27:44,717
You've finally able to invoke
the 100 Healings Mark!

1214
01:27:45,176 --> 01:27:47,178
Lady Tsunade would be so proud…

1215
01:27:47,553 --> 01:27:50,056
Lady Katsuyu, we don't have time…

1216
01:27:50,139 --> 01:27:53,476
Please divide and attend to each person
in the Allied Shinobi Forces.

1217
01:27:53,601 --> 01:27:55,395
Our role will be to heal everyone.

1218
01:27:56,607 --> 01:27:57,817
I never expected

1219
01:27:58,022 --> 01:28:02,068
to see the Three-Way Deadlock
Summoning again!

1220
01:28:08,366 --> 01:28:09,492
Go!

1221
01:28:11,786 --> 01:28:13,037
Go! Aoda!

1222
01:28:16,666 --> 01:28:18,293
Lady Katsuyu, please proceed!

1223
01:28:22,755 --> 01:28:24,757
Jump, Gamakichi!

1224
01:28:33,255 --> 01:28:34,923
<i>This is the original Team 7…</i>

1225
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:13,723
Nice, Gamakichi!

1226
01:29:13,765 --> 01:29:15,933
Your size isn't just for show, eh!

1227
01:29:16,142 --> 01:29:20,980
Nevermind that, just hurry up
and weave your jutsu signs!

1228
01:29:21,189 --> 01:29:23,858
Get with it,
or I'll shake you off my head.

1229
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:26,110
<i>Even his attitude has gotten bigger!</i>

1230
01:29:26,819 --> 01:29:28,196
I know!

1231
01:29:29,572 --> 01:29:30,823
What's going on?

1232
01:29:31,228 --> 01:29:32,396
It's all right.

1233
01:29:32,524 --> 01:29:35,527
These slugs are part
of the Fifth Hokage's Healing Jutsu.

1234
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:37,705
Please do not worry.

1235
01:29:41,709 --> 01:29:43,795
<i>My strength is being restored!</i>

1236
01:29:55,932 --> 01:29:56,933
My wounds are…

1237
01:29:57,350 --> 01:29:58,518
It's healing me…

1238
01:29:59,894 --> 01:30:02,980
<i>Her 100 Healings Mark was
only just activated!</i>

1239
01:30:03,731 --> 01:30:06,734
<i>And yet she can already perform
Lady Katsuyu's long-distance healing!</i>

1240
01:30:07,235 --> 01:30:10,738
<i>Sakura...You are simply amazing!</i>

1241
01:30:17,412 --> 01:30:18,413
Lord Sasuke?

1242
01:30:20,581 --> 01:30:21,624
Keep moving forward.

1243
01:30:42,353 --> 01:30:43,688
Sasuke!

1244
01:30:52,321 --> 01:30:55,575
<i>Wind Style: Massive Rasen Shuriken!</i>

1245
01:30:57,285 --> 01:31:00,371
<i>Inferno Style: Susano'o Flame Control!</i>

1246
01:31:13,968 --> 01:31:17,847
<i>Sasuke and I must've been
compatible, after all…</i>

1247
01:31:18,598 --> 01:31:19,599
<i>Yes…</i>

1248
01:31:19,807 --> 01:31:21,726
<i>Only "Wind" can beat "Lightning."</i>

1249
01:31:22,727 --> 01:31:23,728
<i>No…</i>

1250
01:31:24,437 --> 01:31:25,938
<i>That's not what I meant.</i>

1251
01:31:28,174 --> 01:31:33,846
<i>Only "Wind" can assist
and magnify "Fire"…</i>

1252
01:31:38,951 --> 01:31:39,952
It's hit!

1253
01:31:40,161 --> 01:31:41,454
It really hit!

1254
01:31:42,363 --> 01:31:45,241
<i>I don't recall ever seeing
a Flame Control of that magnitude.</i>

1255
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,128
<i>And they combined jutsu
with matching chakra ratios!</i>

1256
01:31:50,129 --> 01:31:52,298
That's difficult even for
a seasoned duo!

1257
01:31:53,390 --> 01:31:57,394
A windmill-like shuriken,
and an arrow blacker than lacquer…

1258
01:31:57,970 --> 01:31:59,347
Let's name it

1259
01:31:59,713 --> 01:32:02,514
the Scorch Style Nimbus Gale
Jet Black Arrow Formation Zero!

1260
01:32:05,102 --> 01:32:06,854
Nah, never mind.

1261
01:32:18,449 --> 01:32:19,784
Burn away…

1262
01:32:28,109 --> 01:32:31,731
You heard what
Sasuke said earlier, didn't you?

1263
01:32:32,755 --> 01:32:34,632
What are his true intentions?

1264
01:32:43,132 --> 01:32:44,174
I have no idea.

1265
01:32:53,192 --> 01:32:55,778
Look at the sorry state
you're in, Tsunade.

1266
01:32:56,612 --> 01:32:58,823
Gross...A gigantic slug…

1267
01:32:59,323 --> 01:33:01,701
How much salt would
you need to take it down?

1268
01:33:02,968 --> 01:33:04,661
That's just one part of Katsuyu

1269
01:33:04,686 --> 01:33:07,314
that was summoned from
Shikkotsu Woods.

1270
01:33:08,291 --> 01:33:10,668
I'd say it's pretty small, actually.

1271
01:33:10,835 --> 01:33:11,836
You don't say.

1272
01:33:12,336 --> 01:33:15,006
I thought we were here
for the Five Kage, not the slugs.

1273
01:33:15,422 --> 01:33:19,217
Lord Orochimaru,
stop paying attention to Suigetsu

1274
01:33:19,257 --> 01:33:21,205
and get to the task at hand.

1275
01:33:22,555 --> 01:33:26,642
Are you that upset because
you couldn't stay with Sasuke?

1276
01:33:26,726 --> 01:33:29,645
That's totally…not the case!

1277
01:33:30,813 --> 01:33:31,981
Let's just do this.

1278
01:33:32,512 --> 01:33:33,845
Damn you, Suigetsu!

1279
01:33:33,974 --> 01:33:35,976
Why are you picking on me?

1280
01:33:36,193 --> 01:33:39,739
Doesn't everyone who sees
a slug want to sprinkle salt on it?

1281
01:33:40,114 --> 01:33:41,616
Tsunade first!

1282
01:33:42,074 --> 01:33:43,159
Let's go.

1283
01:33:45,703 --> 01:33:46,704
Lady Tsunade!

1284
01:33:48,247 --> 01:33:50,750
Wait, was the Hokage
always a granny?

1285
01:33:50,958 --> 01:33:51,959
Ugh…

1286
01:33:52,356 --> 01:33:56,694
It's not like she had a really
long torso either, right?

1287
01:33:56,938 --> 01:33:59,858
It seems you were reckless, Tsunade.

1288
01:34:00,885 --> 01:34:02,386
Orochimaru?

1289
01:34:05,139 --> 01:34:06,223
Katsuyu…

1290
01:34:06,349 --> 01:34:09,226
I came here to aid the Five Kage.

1291
01:34:09,855 --> 01:34:11,481
I'm not an enemy.

1292
01:34:11,682 --> 01:34:13,684
I have no reason to believe you.

1293
01:34:14,231 --> 01:34:16,567
Besides, you were dead!

1294
01:34:17,950 --> 01:34:20,517
If I do anything that
strikes you as suspect,

1295
01:34:20,542 --> 01:34:23,378
you're welcome to kill me
once and for all with your acid.

1296
01:34:38,923 --> 01:34:40,216
All right.

1297
01:34:40,341 --> 01:34:41,842
I'll believe you.

1298
01:34:42,468 --> 01:34:45,054
You're quite sensible, unlike Manda.

1299
01:34:45,554 --> 01:34:46,555
Now then…

1300
01:34:46,806 --> 01:34:48,015
First of all…

1301
01:34:48,057 --> 01:34:50,059
Where are the other Kage?

1302
01:34:51,223 --> 01:34:54,142
They're recovering inside
my fragments.

1303
01:34:55,414 --> 01:34:58,417
They sustained serious injuries,
and it's very…

1304
01:34:58,734 --> 01:35:00,069
But Katsuyu…

1305
01:35:00,908 --> 01:35:03,953
With you here, why is it taking
so long for them to heal?

1306
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:06,909
I can only use my power
in response

1307
01:35:06,909 --> 01:35:10,037
to the strength of
Lady Tsunade's 100 Healings.

1308
01:35:10,830 --> 01:35:13,582
But Lady Tsunade is
extremely weak right now,

1309
01:35:14,283 --> 01:35:17,119
so I'm not able to activate
my strength fully.

1310
01:35:18,045 --> 01:35:20,297
Is that how the system worked?

1311
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:26,887
Anyway, whatever I remember,
I've never seen Tsunade so weak.

1312
01:35:27,293 --> 01:35:28,669
So it must be true.

1313
01:35:29,306 --> 01:35:32,940
I am trying to persevere
and focus on healing,

1314
01:35:33,112 --> 01:35:35,480
despite the Summoning
starting to unravel.

1315
01:35:36,689 --> 01:35:41,026
That's why I haven't been able
to properly reattach her body.

1316
01:35:41,832 --> 01:35:46,420
Suigetsu, bring Tsunade's lower half
and join it to her upper half.

1317
01:35:46,657 --> 01:35:47,575
Huh?!

1318
01:35:47,679 --> 01:35:49,681
I'm better at cutting things up.

1319
01:35:53,289 --> 01:35:54,498
Ugh…

1320
01:35:56,107 --> 01:35:59,694
The slugs are all slimy
and wriggly. Gross!

1321
01:35:59,719 --> 01:36:01,387
Well, so are you, Suigetsu!

1322
01:36:01,563 --> 01:36:04,817
In fact, you're grosser and weirder
because you have a human form!

1323
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:06,974
Karin…

1324
01:36:06,999 --> 01:36:09,752
Let her bite you
so that she can heal.

1325
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:14,602
What? I don't want anyone
but Sasuke biting me…

1326
01:36:14,627 --> 01:36:17,399
Hah! You just admitted
you're in love with Sasuke!

1327
01:36:17,424 --> 01:36:18,164
Huh?

1328
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:19,231
You're wrong!

1329
01:36:19,315 --> 01:36:23,194
How could I hate,
I mean, like that damn Sasuke?

1330
01:36:23,277 --> 01:36:24,278
What are you saying?

1331
01:36:25,154 --> 01:36:27,948
He tried to kill me…
And it was irresistible…

1332
01:36:28,032 --> 01:36:29,450
No, it wasn't!

1333
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:33,954
You were covered in bite marks
long before Sasuke bit you!

1334
01:36:34,096 --> 01:36:34,972
Shut up!

1335
01:36:34,997 --> 01:36:36,791
Right now, I'm exclusively for Sasuke.

1336
01:36:36,816 --> 01:36:38,735
Don't be so defiant,
you denture mold model.

1337
01:36:39,293 --> 01:36:42,421
Besides, how does
your body work anyway?

1338
01:36:42,748 --> 01:36:44,106
You're the weird one.

1339
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:46,066
What? Say that again!

1340
01:36:46,091 --> 01:36:47,092
You two…

1341
01:36:48,010 --> 01:36:49,428
Make it snappy.

1342
01:36:49,933 --> 01:36:51,727
You're both weird.

1343
01:36:52,163 --> 01:36:53,874
So stop fighting.

1344
01:36:54,266 --> 01:36:55,476
Or else…

1345
01:36:56,143 --> 01:36:58,424
I'll have my snakes ties you up

1346
01:36:58,449 --> 01:37:01,494
and crawl into your mouth
and possess you.

1347
01:37:03,943 --> 01:37:06,445
<i>You're the weirdest one
among us all!</i>

1348
01:37:28,843 --> 01:37:31,971
<i>She's taking so much,
I might end up aging into a hag.</i>

1349
01:37:50,489 --> 01:37:53,033
Lady Tsunade,
you're going to be all right!

1350
01:37:53,909 --> 01:37:57,413
Tsunade, be a little grateful to me.

1351
01:37:58,163 --> 01:38:01,625
You betrayed the village…
So why all of this now?

1352
01:38:02,376 --> 01:38:05,671
The range of things that
interest me has expanded.

1353
01:38:07,054 --> 01:38:11,600
In the past, I wanted to become
the wind and turn the windmill myself.

1354
01:38:12,946 --> 01:38:14,989
But now, I know the pleasure

1355
01:38:15,014 --> 01:38:17,032
of waiting around for
someone else's wind.

1356
01:38:17,057 --> 01:38:18,600
One that is unpredictable.

1357
01:38:19,679 --> 01:38:23,934
And I don't want that wind to
get sealed away before I can enjoy it.

1358
01:38:25,774 --> 01:38:28,152
You still don't make any sense.

1359
01:38:30,279 --> 01:38:32,239
But…I suppose you've changed a little.

1360
01:38:33,949 --> 01:38:34,950
Orochimaru…

1361
01:38:35,261 --> 01:38:39,265
If you were like this sooner,
Jiraiya might not have had to die…

1362
01:38:39,290 --> 01:38:40,959
And if I had…

1363
01:38:41,290 --> 01:38:43,792
Jiraiya might have changed too.

1364
01:38:46,536 --> 01:38:49,372
Like how it was for us,
the Legendary Sannin,

1365
01:38:49,397 --> 01:38:52,817
things don't always go
the way you want them to.

1366
01:38:53,641 --> 01:38:58,354
We're not made of stone.
Distortions will appear somewhere.

1367
01:38:58,515 --> 01:39:02,436
<i>Perhaps that's why I want
to observe Sasuke's future.</i>

1368
01:39:03,998 --> 01:39:07,251
<i>While patiently waiting
for his wind to blow.</i>

1369
01:39:07,816 --> 01:39:11,487
Fine. I thank you for helping me heal.

1370
01:39:12,696 --> 01:39:15,115
So...Do you know about the war?

1371
01:39:15,974 --> 01:39:21,062
Of course. That's why
I'm helping you out like this.

1372
01:39:21,789 --> 01:39:23,290
How long have I been like this?

1373
01:39:23,951 --> 01:39:26,037
I can report on the battle situation.

1374
01:39:26,669 --> 01:39:28,712
How did you end up on the front?

1375
01:39:31,395 --> 01:39:32,479
<i>I see…</i>

1376
01:39:32,875 --> 01:39:34,877
<i>Sakura summoned Katsuyu!</i>

1377
01:39:35,180 --> 01:39:37,471
Around now,
a new Three-Way Deadlock

1378
01:39:37,471 --> 01:39:39,932
is probably making their debut.

1379
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:41,141
What?

1380
01:39:41,517 --> 01:39:44,022
Well, we're heading back.

1381
01:39:44,655 --> 01:39:48,511
You should work on healing
the other Kage.

1382
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:12,423
Then why do you work with Sasuke?

1383
01:40:16,051 --> 01:40:19,221
Because I exist to protect him.

1384
01:40:22,585 --> 01:40:26,589
Sasuke! There are other Tailed Beasts
inside that huge one!

1385
01:40:27,021 --> 01:40:29,481
Once it's weakened,
shut off your Black Flames!

1386
01:40:29,648 --> 01:40:31,734
Then Kurama and I will
pull them out of it!

1387
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:32,801
No.

1388
01:40:33,402 --> 01:40:34,862
They all burn.

1389
01:40:36,030 --> 01:40:37,906
Hey! Don't you get it?

1390
01:40:38,032 --> 01:40:39,616
If we don't save them now,

1391
01:40:39,641 --> 01:40:42,018
we'll end up facing
a lot of trouble later on!

1392
01:40:43,587 --> 01:40:47,924
<i>I'm going to put an end to
this failing system currently in place!</i>

1393
01:40:51,379 --> 01:40:52,838
<i>And then, a new...</i>

1394
01:41:05,992 --> 01:41:08,411
<i>It detached the piece of itself
that was on fire!</i>

1395
01:41:17,470 --> 01:41:20,682
Sakura...Can I ask you something?

1396
01:41:23,148 --> 01:41:26,818
Since I don't know him very well,
I can look at this objectively.

1397
01:41:27,442 --> 01:41:30,278
Sasuke cannot be trusted
as a true comrade.

1398
01:41:31,293 --> 01:41:34,379
What are your true feelings
on the matter, Sakura?

1399
01:41:37,591 --> 01:41:40,969
Don't worry,
Sasuke has come back to us.

1400
01:41:42,055 --> 01:41:46,229
I'm happy about that.
And I do trust him.

1401
01:41:48,936 --> 01:41:51,396
<i>Your words may not be lies...</i>

1402
01:41:52,731 --> 01:41:53,732
<i>But...</i>

1403
01:41:55,186 --> 01:41:59,398
<i>I can already tell that
your smile is fake.</i>

1404
01:42:03,397 --> 01:42:05,315
What's up, Shikamaru?

1405
01:42:07,538 --> 01:42:08,664
It's nothing...

1406
01:42:28,047 --> 01:42:29,048
Obito...

1407
01:42:29,810 --> 01:42:31,478
Enough of these tricks...

1408
01:42:32,229 --> 01:42:33,647
I'm over it.

1409
01:42:37,609 --> 01:42:39,111
No more genjutsu.

1410
01:42:41,572 --> 01:42:45,617
Looks like I can't find anything
that will change you.

1411
01:42:47,536 --> 01:42:50,414
Right now, all I can give you...

1412
01:42:52,082 --> 01:42:53,292
...is death.

1413
01:42:53,876 --> 01:42:56,253
Then I shall do the same.

1414
01:42:58,338 --> 01:42:59,339
Come!

1415
01:43:07,233 --> 01:43:08,109
All right!

1416
01:43:08,348 --> 01:43:09,600
Shinobi Hand-to-Hand Combat!

1417
01:43:11,226 --> 01:43:12,227
Begin!

1418
01:44:45,696 --> 01:44:46,697
I'm going to borrow this.

1419
01:44:53,370 --> 01:44:54,371
<i>Fire Style:</i>

1420
01:44:54,823 --> 01:44:56,197
<i>Fireball Jutsu!</i>

1421
01:44:58,956 --> 01:44:59,790
<i>Earth Style:</i>

1422
01:45:00,104 --> 01:45:01,314
<i>Mud Wall!</i>

1423
01:45:35,037 --> 01:45:36,705
<i>The real one is here!</i>

1424
01:45:57,500 --> 01:46:00,670
Hand-to-hand combat is over.
Kakashi wins.

1425
01:46:01,373 --> 01:46:03,292
Now perform the Unison Sign.

1426
01:46:14,451 --> 01:46:15,744
<i>Obito...</i>

1427
01:46:15,827 --> 01:46:19,581
<i>Your once strong will is
still alive today, right next to me!</i>

1428
01:46:20,573 --> 01:46:24,744
<i>What the current me can do
is protect the current Naruto!</i>

1429
01:46:27,928 --> 01:46:29,132
<i>You will...</i>

1430
01:46:30,008 --> 01:46:36,598
<i>Actually, everyone will
eventually end up just like me.</i>

1431
01:46:40,222 --> 01:46:44,601
<i>Sasuke is a rogue ninja.
Standard procedure is to erase him.</i>

1432
01:46:45,067 --> 01:46:47,653
<i>I'll bring back Sasuke!</i>

1433
01:46:48,135 --> 01:46:50,587
<i>Someone who can't even save
one of their friends</i>

1434
01:46:50,796 --> 01:46:52,756
<i>could never become Hokage!</i>

1435
01:46:52,781 --> 01:46:56,785
<i>I'm going to surpass every Hokage
who came before me!</i>

1436
01:46:57,130 --> 01:47:00,633
- <i>I'd never kill any of my friends!</i>
- <i>I'd never kill any of my friends!</i>

1437
01:47:01,659 --> 01:47:04,579
<i>Naruto...You never waver.</i>

1438
01:47:06,044 --> 01:47:07,773
<i>You're stronger than me and</i>

1439
01:47:07,798 --> 01:47:09,508
<i>you have many things
that are solely yours.</i>

1440
01:47:10,715 --> 01:47:12,884
<i>This is all I can do right now.</i>

1441
01:47:14,469 --> 01:47:17,055
<i>And that is...</i>

1442
01:47:18,557 --> 01:47:22,310
<i>to protect this world, my comrades...</i>

1443
01:47:24,271 --> 01:47:26,731
<i>and the Obito of the past...</i>

1444
01:47:27,910 --> 01:47:29,746
<i>by killing...</i>

1445
01:47:33,779 --> 01:47:35,323
<i>the current Obito!</i>

1446
01:48:13,737 --> 01:48:16,740
It's over, Obito.

1447
01:48:26,252 --> 01:48:28,838
I'll let you win...

1448
01:48:30,613 --> 01:48:33,992
this battle.

1449
01:48:34,017 --> 01:48:37,229
But I'm not conceding the war!

1450
01:48:52,453 --> 01:48:55,915
I thought I told you.
I have no intention of fighting a clone.

1451
01:48:56,947 --> 01:49:00,575
You can come at me with them,
but they offer no resistance at all.

1452
01:49:01,159 --> 01:49:04,079
You're concentrating too much power
in your actual body.

1453
01:49:07,195 --> 01:49:11,158
Madara...All the time, you kept
holding something back...

1454
01:49:16,174 --> 01:49:17,175
That's...

1455
01:49:25,802 --> 01:49:28,805
<i>Looks like that's of no use
to me anymore.</i>

1456
01:49:29,526 --> 01:49:33,864
<i>I wanted to fight Hashirama
before I became a Jinchuriki...</i>

1457
01:49:34,946 --> 01:49:36,406
<i>I guess I have no choice.</i>

1458
01:49:43,910 --> 01:49:45,412
M-My body!

1459
01:49:47,163 --> 01:49:50,875
<i>It's time to make him bring me back
with Rinne Rebirth!</i>

1460
01:50:24,659 --> 01:50:25,535
<i>That's...!</i>

1461
01:50:29,041 --> 01:50:30,209
Obito...

1462
01:50:31,129 --> 01:50:35,467
You're just a backup that
I had cultivated for my rebirth.

1463
01:50:36,546 --> 01:50:38,465
<i>You saved me, Gramps?</i>

1464
01:50:40,133 --> 01:50:41,134
<i>Thank you.</i>

1465
01:50:41,718 --> 01:50:44,262
<i>It's too early to thank me.</i>

1466
01:50:44,638 --> 01:50:47,432
<i>I intend to have you...</i>

1467
01:50:47,457 --> 01:50:49,001
<i>...repay your debt.</i>

1468
01:50:49,392 --> 01:50:51,519
That time is now.

1469
01:50:55,690 --> 01:50:58,151
<i>He's being controlled by
Madara's chakra!</i>

1470
01:51:03,365 --> 01:51:05,075
<i>The Six Paths Forbidden...</i>

1471
01:51:05,325 --> 01:51:07,369
<i>Rinne Rebirth Jutsu?</i>

1472
01:51:08,117 --> 01:51:11,620
<i>Madara...He must not be allowed
to fully return to life!</i>

1473
01:51:12,957 --> 01:51:14,167
Lads!

1474
01:51:14,309 --> 01:51:15,894
You're all closer!

1475
01:51:15,919 --> 01:51:18,713
Stop the jutsu of the one
on top of the Ten-Tails right now!

1476
01:51:19,297 --> 01:51:20,548
Okay! Got—

1477
01:51:21,758 --> 01:51:22,967
Sasuke!

1478
01:51:27,055 --> 01:51:28,223
I see...

1479
01:51:29,432 --> 01:51:31,017
So that's how it is.

1480
01:51:39,275 --> 01:51:42,904
<i>Is this the maximum amount
I can make inside this barrier?</i>

1481
01:51:43,154 --> 01:51:44,239
Tobirama!

1482
01:51:44,264 --> 01:51:45,265
Okay!

1483
01:51:46,026 --> 01:51:47,880
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

1484
01:51:50,203 --> 01:51:51,413
Only two.

1485
01:51:52,063 --> 01:51:53,398
Is this also the best I can do?

1486
01:51:53,915 --> 01:51:55,667
We'll just have to make do with this!

1487
01:51:57,919 --> 01:52:02,632
They can't get to Obito in time,
so they're going to attack me...

1488
01:52:03,691 --> 01:52:08,070
They should know by now
that I can't be stopped with clones.

1489
01:52:19,733 --> 01:52:22,026
That's enough, Aoda!
You can get out of here!

1490
01:52:23,027 --> 01:52:24,738
Yes, Lord Sasuke!

1491
01:53:26,299 --> 01:53:29,636
<i>You won't always be
like this either, right?</i>

1492
01:53:30,303 --> 01:53:31,387
<i>Don't give up.</i>

1493
01:53:34,004 --> 01:53:36,673
<i>You love Rin, don't you?</i>

1494
01:53:41,156 --> 01:53:42,866
<i>We'll both become Hokage.</i>

1495
01:53:45,873 --> 01:53:47,938
<i>Right, Obito?</i>

1496
01:53:56,830 --> 01:53:58,122
Sensei...

1497
01:54:00,792 --> 01:54:01,793
Obito!

1498
01:54:09,970 --> 01:54:13,140
That...was you?

1499
01:54:26,818 --> 01:54:27,986
Which one is he?

1500
01:54:30,952 --> 01:54:32,367
What a failure!

1501
01:54:33,616 --> 01:54:35,785
But...oh well!

1502
01:54:36,919 --> 01:54:37,920
Did they succeed?!

1503
01:54:38,162 --> 01:54:40,331
That's Lord Fourth Hokage!

1504
01:54:43,835 --> 01:54:46,337
<i>He teleported a Shadow Clone.</i>

1505
01:54:47,422 --> 01:54:49,299
<i>Had he marked him already?</i>

1506
01:54:55,060 --> 01:54:57,687
A Flying Raijin marking
never disappears.

1507
01:54:58,982 --> 01:55:02,237
I didn't teach you that, did I, Obito?

1508
01:55:07,567 --> 01:55:09,277
If you were alive,

1509
01:55:09,402 --> 01:55:11,446
I would have wanted you
to become Hokage...

1510
01:55:12,340 --> 01:55:13,467
Why did you...?

1511
01:55:16,025 --> 01:55:17,512
That was disappointing...

1512
01:55:18,369 --> 01:55:22,498
All that's left to do is to seal
the un-reborn Madara...

1513
01:55:22,999 --> 01:55:24,667
and this war will be over.

1514
01:55:25,627 --> 01:55:27,337
As well as this giant thing.

1515
01:55:29,027 --> 01:55:32,071
What makes you think
the war is over...

1516
01:55:32,756 --> 01:55:35,017
my fellow traitor?

1517
01:55:55,657 --> 01:55:57,116
Dad! Sasuke!

1518
01:56:02,914 --> 01:56:04,165
Gamakichi!

1519
01:56:04,248 --> 01:56:05,249
Okay!

1520
01:56:11,339 --> 01:56:13,216
What? What's happening?!

1521
01:56:14,146 --> 01:56:16,440
Is the Ten-Tails changing
form again?

1522
01:56:19,973 --> 01:56:21,641
No, that's not what's happening!

1523
01:56:21,724 --> 01:56:24,143
He shook off Madara's manipulation and

1524
01:56:24,494 --> 01:56:29,023
was weaving the signs
to do this from the beginning!

1525
01:56:40,368 --> 01:56:41,369
That's...

1526
01:56:51,462 --> 01:56:54,757
...the Ten-Tails' Jinchuriki!
