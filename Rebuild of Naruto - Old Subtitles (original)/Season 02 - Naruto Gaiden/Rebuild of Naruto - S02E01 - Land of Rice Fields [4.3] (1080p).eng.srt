1
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:43,811
It could be that way...

2
00:01:52,143 --> 00:01:55,990
Sure enough, Ichiraku ramen is
the best for getting energized!

3
00:01:56,858 --> 00:01:58,493
One more, Pops!

4
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,582
Coming right up!

5
00:02:05,602 --> 00:02:06,454
Huh?

6
00:02:11,786 --> 00:02:13,441
One more, you said, eh...?

7
00:02:13,793 --> 00:02:15,194
Just when I thought you'd
snuck out of your hospital room

8
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:16,929
and were doing some training...

9
00:02:21,471 --> 00:02:23,181
You guys want some, too?

10
00:02:25,815 --> 00:02:28,083
Pop, here's the tab.

11
00:02:28,556 --> 00:02:30,058
Thanks for your business!

12
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,530
Jeez, I'm fine!

13
00:02:33,555 --> 00:02:37,810
Naruto, even if it looks like
you've healed, you're still battered.

14
00:02:38,883 --> 00:02:44,878
It's not like that!
I have to train and get stronger!

15
00:02:44,903 --> 00:02:47,947
Yeah yeah,
after you've healed completely.

16
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:53,436
Damn it! I have to keep my promise
to Sakura without further delay!

17
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,973
<i>Sakura...You're so pathetic.</i>

18
00:03:04,146 --> 00:03:09,902
<i>All I did...was cry...
All I did was totally rely on Naruto.</i>

19
00:03:10,832 --> 00:03:12,417
<i>I didn't do anything myself.</i>

20
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:19,574
<i>Naruto tried to bring back Sasuke
even if it meant his life...</i>

21
00:03:34,433 --> 00:03:37,603
<i>What can I do for Sasuke now...?</i>

22
00:03:42,184 --> 00:03:44,104
<i>I just have to put my
life on the line and do it!</i>

23
00:03:50,102 --> 00:03:53,730
It's futile. The ropes are made
of a maiden's black hair.

24
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,786
And the knot is a shinobi
reverse butterfly knot.

25
00:03:57,018 --> 00:03:59,103
It won't be easily untied.

26
00:03:59,758 --> 00:04:01,718
Give me a break.

27
00:04:01,822 --> 00:04:07,494
I have to start training as soon
as possible and get stronger.

28
00:04:07,887 --> 00:04:12,600
Then do as the Medical Corps says
and rest quietly.

29
00:04:15,042 --> 00:04:15,826
Come in.

30
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:21,509
Oh...

31
00:04:23,553 --> 00:04:25,180
Sorry, Sakura...

32
00:04:25,488 --> 00:04:28,491
I'd like to get moving immediately
if possible, but...

33
00:04:32,713 --> 00:04:36,258
He has astonishing recuperative power,
but overdoing it is a big no no.

34
00:04:36,334 --> 00:04:38,461
I'm okay!

35
00:04:39,022 --> 00:04:40,774
Be a little more patient!

36
00:04:54,604 --> 00:04:59,776
Just wait a little longer!
I'll keep my promise, no matter what!

37
00:05:01,565 --> 00:05:02,565
No...

38
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,070
It's okay...

39
00:05:06,526 --> 00:05:08,653
Up until now,
I was totally reliant on you...

40
00:05:08,938 --> 00:05:11,107
and I did nothing, so...

41
00:05:11,671 --> 00:05:13,131
What's the matter, Sakura...?

42
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,546
Did something happen?!

43
00:05:14,864 --> 00:05:18,993
No...I'm relieved
to see you doing well.

44
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,880
This time, I'll do my best.

45
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,147
Sakura...?

46
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,014
I heard you snuck out of the hospital.

47
00:06:00,743 --> 00:06:02,578
Do you want to train that badly?

48
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:06,406
Pervy Sage...? My...apple!

49
00:06:06,554 --> 00:06:08,973
Well well, things look
like they're going smoothly.

50
00:06:09,304 --> 00:06:12,057
Don't you worry.
I'll train you hard right away.

51
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:15,437
Umm...about the training.

52
00:06:15,838 --> 00:06:18,038
I was wondering if you could
wait a little while longer.

53
00:06:18,103 --> 00:06:18,937
Hmm?

54
00:06:19,024 --> 00:06:21,359
I'm not saying
I don't want to train.

55
00:06:21,953 --> 00:06:26,916
But I remembered some odds
and ends I need to take care of.

56
00:06:27,686 --> 00:06:28,686
Oh?

57
00:06:33,841 --> 00:06:34,998
Odds and ends, huh?

58
00:06:35,861 --> 00:06:38,029
Come on. Please?

59
00:06:51,957 --> 00:06:52,957
Come in!

60
00:06:54,077 --> 00:06:56,663
Oh, I've been spotted, huh?

61
00:06:57,627 --> 00:06:59,087
I'm guessing, you want to peep?

62
00:06:59,338 --> 00:07:02,688
No matter how long you wait,
I won't show anything.

63
00:07:02,801 --> 00:07:05,471
Who'd peep at an old lady?!

64
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,804
N-No, I take that back!

65
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:16,188
Actually, I've come to make an
earnest request to you as the Hokage.

66
00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:21,219
Talk.

67
00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:33,103
It couldn't be
that Sakura's going to...

68
00:08:13,262 --> 00:08:15,597
<i>This might be...my last look...</i>

69
00:08:21,336 --> 00:08:22,336
Sakura...

70
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,220
How did you?

71
00:08:32,628 --> 00:08:35,298
I know what you're thinking!

72
00:08:35,975 --> 00:08:38,936
That there'd be nothing
I could do even if I were to go...!

73
00:08:40,048 --> 00:08:43,259
But I hate that I'm
just standing here doing nothing!

74
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:48,713
Always being a hindrance to
and taking advantage of everyone...

75
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:52,289
Not being able to do
one single thing respectably...

76
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,556
It's useless to stop me!

77
00:08:55,627 --> 00:08:57,045
I won't stop you...

78
00:08:58,319 --> 00:09:00,529
You should do it
until you're satisfied.

79
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,607
But...I'm going, too.

80
00:09:05,241 --> 00:09:06,241
But...

81
00:09:07,657 --> 00:09:09,659
It's become just the two of us...

82
00:09:10,473 --> 00:09:12,475
But we're a three-man squad, right?

83
00:09:16,661 --> 00:09:17,297
Yeah.

84
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:21,229
You guys...

85
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:24,303
Oops! Pervy Sage?

86
00:09:27,423 --> 00:09:31,427
<i>This person...is Jiraiya,
one of the legendary Sannin?</i>

87
00:09:32,193 --> 00:09:34,528
If you, without permission,

88
00:09:34,787 --> 00:09:37,414
go out past the border of
the Village Hidden in the Leaves...

89
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:42,266
you know that you'll be sent
to prison as rogue ninja, right?

90
00:09:42,469 --> 00:09:44,262
It's no use stopping us!

91
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:47,661
I won't stop you.

92
00:09:50,266 --> 00:09:53,478
You've been given a mission
by Lady Hokage.

93
00:09:53,937 --> 00:09:56,857
You're to investigate and report
on the Land of Rice Paddies

94
00:09:56,909 --> 00:10:00,496
where the Village Hidden in Sound is,
and where Sasuke has been taken to.

95
00:10:02,105 --> 00:10:04,732
The mission is set to be carried out
in a group of three.

96
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:09,804
As of now, you will work under me.
You got a problem?!

97
00:10:22,741 --> 00:10:26,495
<i>It seems they're the biggest of fools.</i>

98
00:10:29,055 --> 00:10:31,224
<i>They won't stop even if you tried.</i>

99
00:10:31,636 --> 00:10:36,224
<i>At this rate,
we'll lose two important subordinates!</i>

100
00:10:38,026 --> 00:10:39,948
<i>You'll recognize it as a special mission</i>

101
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:44,936
<i>with the goal of investigating
the Hidden Sound Village, right?</i>

102
00:10:48,794 --> 00:10:50,003
<i>I have no choice, huh...?</i>

103
00:10:53,014 --> 00:10:54,516
<i>But I have a condition.</i>

104
00:10:54,746 --> 00:10:58,291
<i>Bring the two back alive. Got it?</i>

105
00:10:58,903 --> 00:11:02,323
<i>Sure, even if it costs my life.</i>

106
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:09,739
<i>It's too dangerous of a mission,
even with Jiraiya going with them...</i>

107
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,781
<i>Sasuke...</i>

108
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:49,154
That's the Land of Rice Paddies where
the Hidden Sound Village is.

109
00:11:50,965 --> 00:11:52,967
It's Orochimaru's headquarters.

110
00:11:53,861 --> 00:11:55,301
Take sufficient caution and proceed.

111
00:11:55,784 --> 00:11:59,120
It's kind of anticlimactic...

112
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:03,620
I thought a bunch of Orochimaru's
followers would be here to greet us!

113
00:12:04,025 --> 00:12:06,444
Is this really the Hidden Sound Village?

114
00:12:07,114 --> 00:12:10,117
It seems to be a peaceful,
quiet and nice land, but...

115
00:12:11,324 --> 00:12:14,953
No, we still haven't entered
the Hidden Sound Village.

116
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:17,029
This is the Land of Rice Paddies.

117
00:12:17,185 --> 00:12:18,185
Land of Rice Paddies?

118
00:12:18,318 --> 00:12:20,445
It's a small land that's nothing special.

119
00:12:20,638 --> 00:12:24,358
The feudal lord was a foolish lord who
hungered for powerful military strength

120
00:12:24,383 --> 00:12:29,013
in order to make the land
disproportionately larger.

121
00:12:29,843 --> 00:12:34,181
Orochimaru probably won his favor
with some fast talking...

122
00:12:35,372 --> 00:12:39,733
Of course, Orochimaru himself wasn't
thinking about making the land stronger.

123
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:45,221
He just had an ambition to make himself
stronger and to carry out revenge...

124
00:12:45,356 --> 00:12:49,819
That's why there's nothing in this area
that points to his presence.

125
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,366
Really? So, Pervy Sage...

126
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,825
Don't call me Pervy Sage!

127
00:12:55,015 --> 00:12:58,560
That's right...
He's one of the legendary Sannin, so...

128
00:12:59,547 --> 00:13:03,801
He's just a lady loving
perverted Pervy Sage!

129
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:05,152
What?!

130
00:13:06,197 --> 00:13:10,008
More importantly,
where's the Hidden Sound Village?

131
00:13:10,822 --> 00:13:12,824
Beats me...I don't know...

132
00:13:12,849 --> 00:13:13,849
What?!

133
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:18,198
We don't know where it is,
so we're going to investigate, right?

134
00:13:18,282 --> 00:13:20,034
You've got a point, but...

135
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:22,836
But how do we find it?

136
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:26,380
There can't be a place where
people are without food and ladies.

137
00:13:26,844 --> 00:13:30,097
People gather where
there's food and girls!

138
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:34,273
- Where people gather, there's news.
- There goes Pervy Sage's bad habit.

139
00:13:34,435 --> 00:13:37,605
He's planning to sow his wild oats
under the guise of a special mission.

140
00:13:37,721 --> 00:13:40,921
First off, finding a traveler's town with
lots of hot ladies is the top priority!

141
00:13:41,301 --> 00:13:44,763
Every land should have a traveler's town.

142
00:13:53,894 --> 00:13:56,480
This is a traveler's town...right?

143
00:13:56,851 --> 00:13:59,396
Looks like nobody's living here anymore.

144
00:14:00,576 --> 00:14:02,245
No, I feel the presence of people...

145
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:04,522
And the smell of face powder!

146
00:14:08,946 --> 00:14:11,240
- Naruto, take it out.
- Take what out?

147
00:14:11,565 --> 00:14:12,983
Don't act like you don't know!

148
00:14:13,008 --> 00:14:15,511
In anything one does,
a war chest is necessary, right?

149
00:14:16,107 --> 00:14:19,026
What! Are you after my wallet? Man!

150
00:14:23,301 --> 00:14:27,263
What?! This shouldn't be it!
Try jumping!

151
00:14:27,371 --> 00:14:27,985
Huh?!

152
00:14:30,325 --> 00:14:32,035
No! Stop!

153
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:39,545
One, two, three...Is this all you got?

154
00:14:40,724 --> 00:14:42,893
That's all of it, really!

155
00:14:43,745 --> 00:14:44,998
- Here...
- Huh?

156
00:14:45,628 --> 00:14:47,380
It's not much, but please use it.

157
00:14:47,545 --> 00:14:51,215
No! Sakura, there's no need for
you to give that to him!

158
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:54,727
But, it's money for
gathering information, right?

159
00:14:54,808 --> 00:14:57,186
Right, right. This should be enough.

160
00:15:01,553 --> 00:15:04,689
You guys go on ahead to the outskirts
of the post station and wait!

161
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:06,857
Wh-Why?

162
00:15:07,014 --> 00:15:10,518
It's too dangerous ahead from here.
It's a mission for adults.

163
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:41,004
Hmm, the smell of
face powder's from here.

164
00:15:47,587 --> 00:15:48,839
Welcome...

165
00:15:49,557 --> 00:15:51,868
Along came a sucker just begging
to be parted from his money.

166
00:15:51,962 --> 00:15:54,632
We should be able to pulverize him.

167
00:15:59,195 --> 00:16:02,156
Food and drink! And young women!

168
00:16:09,563 --> 00:16:12,337
Even if you give the Pervy Sage money,

169
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,549
he's just going to sow his oats without
gathering any information, anyway.

170
00:16:16,618 --> 00:16:18,078
Sow his oats...?

171
00:16:18,446 --> 00:16:21,616
Y-Yeah...
I don't really know about it, but...

172
00:16:21,641 --> 00:16:23,976
You know, make out blah blah blah...

173
00:16:24,196 --> 00:16:27,491
It's fine!
If I can be of at least some help...

174
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:30,752
I'm always a hindrance
who can't do anything, so...

175
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,739
It's not like that!

176
00:16:33,891 --> 00:16:36,463
In the first place,
if you hadn't taken action...

177
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,028
I'd still be tied to the bed!

178
00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:51,739
Even in different lands,
there are young women everywhere.

179
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:54,382
So? Why don't we move to
the room in the back?

180
00:16:54,518 --> 00:16:57,104
I want to talk more relaxed.

181
00:16:57,692 --> 00:16:59,235
Nice, nice.

182
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:02,573
Then first, settle up the tab
for here, okay?

183
00:17:03,426 --> 00:17:06,471
What, am I already drunk
on this cheap drink...?

184
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:09,072
Aren't there like three too many zeros?

185
00:17:10,641 --> 00:17:11,726
You like to joke, do you?

186
00:17:25,204 --> 00:17:28,499
If you value your life,
leave everything you've got here.

187
00:17:31,235 --> 00:17:32,910
I see how it is.

188
00:17:38,252 --> 00:17:40,963
Master Jiraiya's late.

189
00:17:41,372 --> 00:17:43,908
I'm sick of waiting.

190
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:47,625
Naruto!

191
00:17:55,612 --> 00:17:56,398
Who's there?!

192
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:13,883
Who're you?!
Are you one of Orochimaru's followers?!

193
00:18:14,614 --> 00:18:16,408
<i>What? Was I wrong?!</i>

194
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:18,292
<i>Damn it.</i>

195
00:18:20,782 --> 00:18:23,818
That kid had erased his presence
until he'd gotten that close.

196
00:18:24,454 --> 00:18:25,455
I won't let him get away!

197
00:18:26,025 --> 00:18:26,860
Don't move!

198
00:18:26,948 --> 00:18:28,992
Wh-Why?!

199
00:18:29,387 --> 00:18:30,308
Makibishi spikes!

200
00:18:33,474 --> 00:18:35,351
Naruto!

201
00:18:36,029 --> 00:18:37,406
Wh-What?!

202
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,411
- Hold it! You jerk!
- We won't let you get away!

203
00:18:53,792 --> 00:18:55,168
Naruto, what's that?!

204
00:18:56,205 --> 00:18:58,666
Pervy Sage? What did you do?!

205
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,357
I'll tell you later!
Let's get out of here!

206
00:19:01,382 --> 00:19:02,633
Why?!

207
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,268
Companions of that person just now?

208
00:19:04,896 --> 00:19:08,399
If they're Orochimaru's followers,
then I'll use my Shadow Clone Jutsu and...

209
00:19:08,562 --> 00:19:11,407
No, no! Don't get the wrong idea!

210
00:19:12,092 --> 00:19:15,262
They're just bodyguards
from a rip off bar!

211
00:19:16,517 --> 00:19:17,914
R-Rip off bar?!

212
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:22,496
First and foremost, this mission has
to be carried out in strict secrecy!

213
00:19:22,606 --> 00:19:25,526
There'd be no point if you were
to use ninjutsu and stand out!

214
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:30,295
You! Carry the bags!

215
00:19:30,364 --> 00:19:33,200
The one who's totally standing out
is you, Pervy Sage!

216
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:35,995
You have a point.

217
00:19:36,403 --> 00:19:41,910
<i>This is wrong!
Will we really reach Sasuke like this?!</i>

218
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:12,919
It seems that the most bustling traveler's
town in the Land of Rice Paddies

219
00:20:12,944 --> 00:20:14,766
is at the bottom of these mountains.

220
00:20:14,988 --> 00:20:17,048
You're going to weird places again

221
00:20:17,073 --> 00:20:19,450
in the name of investigation,
aren't you, Pervy Sage?!

222
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,501
Please stop it already!

223
00:20:21,858 --> 00:20:25,528
We had a rough time shaking
off the bodyguards from the rip off bar.

224
00:20:28,492 --> 00:20:30,521
I understand your point,

225
00:20:30,557 --> 00:20:35,395
but there's no other way to find
the Hidden Sound Village.

226
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,433
Gee, I don't like it either, but...

227
00:20:39,836 --> 00:20:41,504
This is truly a problem...

228
00:20:41,529 --> 00:20:45,449
But we have to do things
we don't like...Right?!

229
00:20:47,399 --> 00:20:48,609
Okay, let's go!

230
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:51,416
Naruto, Sakura,
don't drag your feet!

231
00:20:51,771 --> 00:20:55,942
Investigation, investigation!
What a pain.

232
00:20:56,196 --> 00:20:57,697
He looks like he's having fun.

233
00:20:57,936 --> 00:21:00,147
He hasn't learned at all.

234
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,728
- Oww!
- That's my line!

235
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:19,813
This is even rougher than
the last traveler's town.

236
00:21:20,213 --> 00:21:24,384
Let's just take a pass on this place
and find the Hidden Sound Village.

237
00:21:36,569 --> 00:21:37,408
Say...

238
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,840
I don't have any more money.

239
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,219
I don't have any more money either!

240
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:43,490
Here!

241
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:46,791
You guys go get some food with that

242
00:21:46,953 --> 00:21:48,902
and wait in the temple
on the outskirts of town.

243
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,986
Information accumulates
in this kind of place,

244
00:21:57,011 --> 00:21:59,308
but it's not good for you guys to see.

245
00:21:59,729 --> 00:22:02,857
I'll sacrifice myself and check it out.

246
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:07,419
He's a surprisingly nice person...

247
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:12,795
Sakura...You're still so naive.

248
00:22:13,527 --> 00:22:15,779
Where should I investigate first?

249
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:20,539
Gee, how rough...
Investigations are painful.

250
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,887
Let's leave the Pervy Sage be
and check somewhere else.

251
00:22:31,034 --> 00:22:32,245
What's the matter, Sakura?

252
00:22:35,418 --> 00:22:39,005
I don't think...
Sasuke's in this land anymore.

253
00:22:39,452 --> 00:22:41,203
What's the matter?!

254
00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:44,104
We won't know that if
we don't investigate!

255
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:45,211
Yeah, but...

256
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,968
Our opponent is Orochimaru.

257
00:22:49,439 --> 00:22:51,774
Of course, things might not go easily.

258
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:54,998
But you know...

259
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,294
But I'm sure we'll find him!

260
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:02,254
Right.

261
00:23:05,261 --> 00:23:06,261
Naruto!

262
00:23:10,284 --> 00:23:12,244
You're...the one from before?!

263
00:23:15,738 --> 00:23:17,599
This kid's...hurt...

264
00:23:18,335 --> 00:23:19,214
You...?

265
00:23:20,253 --> 00:23:20,887
Naruto!

266
00:23:48,168 --> 00:23:49,503
Substitution, huh...?

267
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,013
We let them get away.

268
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:56,709
Don't worry...

269
00:23:56,803 --> 00:24:01,599
My cute children
are making a silver trail for us.

270
00:24:01,927 --> 00:24:04,555
They can't escape from us now...

271
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:12,254
It seems those two are
petty ninja from somewhere else.

272
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:15,240
But getting involved with us
has sealed their fate.

273
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:16,696
It's unfortunate for them...

274
00:24:17,367 --> 00:24:22,205
The objective of those who sneak into
this land is Lord Orochimaru, anyway.

275
00:24:43,996 --> 00:24:47,124
Sure enough, the skin of
a young woman is supple.

276
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,254
You're mean!

277
00:24:48,489 --> 00:24:50,282
Eh? Oh, sorry sorry.

278
00:24:51,493 --> 00:24:56,164
By the way, have you guys heard
rumors about the Sound Village?

279
00:24:56,342 --> 00:24:57,635
The Sound Village?

280
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:00,513
I've never heard the name
of such a village.

281
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,502
I'll tip you handsomely if you tell me.

282
00:25:05,858 --> 00:25:08,027
But I really don't know.

283
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:09,875
I've never heard of it.

284
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:12,370
I've heard of it!

285
00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:17,750
One of my regulars knows
a lot about it.

286
00:25:18,537 --> 00:25:19,537
Wanna come?

287
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,010
Yeah.

288
00:25:22,506 --> 00:25:24,516
His home is in the back of this alley.

289
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:46,328
Trapped like a rat.

290
00:25:46,571 --> 00:25:50,826
What, it's a seedy old man!
Hey! He's got money, right?

291
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:54,753
Yeah. I saw it with my own eyes.

292
00:25:55,178 --> 00:26:00,183
You punks! Stop the idle chatter
and take care of him now!

293
00:26:00,678 --> 00:26:01,679
Right, boss!

294
00:26:10,297 --> 00:26:13,801
Getting infatuated with girls has sealed
your fate! Rest in peace!

295
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,900
<i>Ninja Art: Needle Jizo.</i>

296
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,010
You punk...

297
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:40,140
I'm in a hurry...

298
00:26:40,971 --> 00:26:43,140
I think it'd be best if you
answer compliantly

299
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:48,523
whether or not you know
about the Hidden Sound Village.

300
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:53,695
You're a fool if I look like
a compliant person to you!

301
00:26:54,854 --> 00:26:56,147
You a ninja?

302
00:26:57,226 --> 00:26:58,477
If so?

303
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,744
Interesting!

304
00:27:01,315 --> 00:27:04,112
We've reduced ourselves to
being thieves,

305
00:27:04,287 --> 00:27:07,707
but we're a somewhat
famous shinobi clan around here!

306
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:12,088
Instead of taking your life,
I could hire you if you want!

307
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:14,716
A ninja, huh...

308
00:27:16,897 --> 00:27:19,490
Then I don't need to go easy on you.

309
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:23,310
Don't be acting like a big shot, old man!

310
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,708
Shut up, you squirt!

311
00:27:27,928 --> 00:27:30,555
"Ninja" refers to one who endures.

312
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,286
Those who couldn't endure
their hunger pangs

313
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,292
and resort to use their diligently
studied jutsu for stealing

314
00:27:36,462 --> 00:27:38,548
are not called ninja!

315
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:40,784
I won't let that pass!

316
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:44,037
Thinking we're fellow shinobi,
we took pity on you.

317
00:27:44,088 --> 00:27:45,757
Acting all conceited!

318
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,376
You'll regret it
after being sliced in two!

319
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,966
<i>Fuma Ninja Blade Zanbato!</i>

320
00:28:02,867 --> 00:28:04,243
<i>Rasengan!</i>

321
00:28:18,149 --> 00:28:19,984
You punk! How dare you
do that to the boss!

322
00:28:20,756 --> 00:28:22,382
We won't let you do
any more than that!

323
00:28:22,511 --> 00:28:23,179
Oh?

324
00:28:23,329 --> 00:28:25,331
Hold it, you guys!

325
00:28:38,271 --> 00:28:40,273
I didn't know you were so good!

326
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,011
That jutsu just now...

327
00:28:42,151 --> 00:28:45,154
I sense you must be
a person of stature!

328
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:50,019
If it's all right,
may I ask you your name?

329
00:28:52,646 --> 00:28:55,482
If you don't know, then I shall tell you!

330
00:28:58,963 --> 00:29:02,095
Women become infatuated
with his sex appeal.

331
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,539
He's strong against shinobi,
but has a soft spot for women!

332
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,287
He exists in the
Village Hidden in the Leaves...

333
00:29:07,615 --> 00:29:10,050
And made his name known...

334
00:29:18,546 --> 00:29:24,385
Master Jiraiya, that's me!

335
00:29:25,613 --> 00:29:27,615
What?!

336
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:31,478
You guys bow your heads
and beg for your lives!

337
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,813
We'll all be killed!

338
00:29:35,643 --> 00:29:37,103
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

339
00:29:38,727 --> 00:29:40,746
Although we didn't know,
being so rude to Master Jiraiya,

340
00:29:40,771 --> 00:29:45,417
reputed as one of the legendary
Sannin of the Leaf Village!

341
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:49,689
We beg for your forgiveness!

342
00:29:51,507 --> 00:29:54,427
So my name's known
in this land, too...

343
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:56,354
Well, it's okay.

344
00:29:56,711 --> 00:30:01,591
So is it true that you know about
the Hidden Sound Village?

345
00:30:02,113 --> 00:30:05,867
Yes! There were many ninja clans
in the Land of Rice Paddies,

346
00:30:05,982 --> 00:30:08,150
including us Fuma.

347
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:11,030
We divided up the roles
amongst ourselves

348
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:15,021
and the ninja of this land
were doing well in their own way.

349
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,503
Until that man appeared...

350
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:21,897
Who was that man?

351
00:30:22,977 --> 00:30:25,521
It's regrettable to even speak
of his name...

352
00:30:27,961 --> 00:30:30,506
It was Orochimaru!

353
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,629
It's okay! Rest easy!

354
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:43,517
If germs get into the wound
and you get tetanus,

355
00:30:43,589 --> 00:30:44,606
you won't be saved.

356
00:30:45,481 --> 00:30:48,817
But fortunately, I have medicine,
so let me treat you.

357
00:30:49,317 --> 00:30:51,913
They're not coming.

358
00:30:52,342 --> 00:30:54,928
Just show us your wound.

359
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:01,217
Well, huh?

360
00:31:04,995 --> 00:31:07,873
Naruto, go wait outside
till my treatment is done.

361
00:31:07,978 --> 00:31:08,520
Huh?

362
00:31:14,897 --> 00:31:18,703
Why do I have to be
the only one chased out?!

363
00:31:20,489 --> 00:31:21,823
Jeez!

364
00:31:22,454 --> 00:31:24,373
I guess it can't be helped.

365
00:31:31,195 --> 00:31:32,238
Don't peek!

366
00:31:41,664 --> 00:31:42,700
I know.

367
00:31:43,176 --> 00:31:45,011
Okay, show me your wound.

368
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,431
How mean...

369
00:32:08,456 --> 00:32:10,583
To hit me out of the blue...?

370
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,908
Whoa, interesting.

371
00:32:17,677 --> 00:32:19,513
Naruto! You can come in!

372
00:32:20,268 --> 00:32:22,450
What?!

373
00:32:26,923 --> 00:32:28,967
A cute girl?

374
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,793
Sakura! This girl!
Who the heck is this girl?!

375
00:32:35,818 --> 00:32:37,904
How dense. It's the ninja
from a moment ago.

376
00:32:46,243 --> 00:32:47,312
Come to think of it...

377
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,512
Why...?

378
00:32:58,168 --> 00:32:59,878
I am Sasame Fuma.

379
00:33:07,311 --> 00:33:11,399
Sasame...Why were you being
chased by those guys?

380
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,509
If you like, try talking about it.

381
00:33:13,963 --> 00:33:15,965
We might be able to help.

382
00:33:23,032 --> 00:33:27,370
They were Sound Ninja protecting
Orochimaru's residence.

383
00:33:27,819 --> 00:33:28,515
What?!

384
00:33:29,022 --> 00:33:33,151
I'm sorry for mistaking you guys as
one of them the other day.

385
00:33:33,933 --> 00:33:36,018
That doesn't matter!

386
00:33:36,207 --> 00:33:38,834
We're also looking for Orochimaru!

387
00:33:39,375 --> 00:33:41,299
Would you please give us the details?

388
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,102
Okay...

389
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:48,901
It all started with the Feudal Lord
of the Land of Rice Paddies

390
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,070
launching an attack on
a neighboring land

391
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:52,912
in an attempt to expand the territory.

392
00:33:54,485 --> 00:33:56,612
The Land of Rice Paddies
is a small land...

393
00:33:56,932 --> 00:33:59,268
And there aren't that many shinobi.

394
00:34:01,466 --> 00:34:04,927
It was a foolhardy attack.
Losing was expected...

395
00:34:06,402 --> 00:34:08,738
And the shinobi clans of this land

396
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:13,099
who participated in
the losing battle went to ruin...

397
00:34:14,774 --> 00:34:17,399
Including us, the Fuma Clan.

398
00:34:19,398 --> 00:34:21,275
I hear that among
the surviving shinobi,

399
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,527
there are those who have left this land

400
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:25,081
and those who have
stooped to becoming thieves.

401
00:34:25,735 --> 00:34:28,757
Even so, we've lived believing
in a restoration of the clan

402
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:31,161
and continued to live hiding
in the shadows.

403
00:34:32,515 --> 00:34:36,894
Back then, an emissary of the Hidden
Sound Village appeared before us

404
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:41,662
offering to create a full scale shinobi
village in the Land of Rice Paddies.

405
00:34:45,282 --> 00:34:47,714
The emissary of
the Sound Village said...

406
00:34:48,225 --> 00:34:53,313
<i>My master, Orochimaru, is
gathering all sorts of jutsu!</i>

407
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,636
<i>He has taken an interest
in your jutsu well.</i>

408
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,929
<i>Depending on your work,</i>

409
00:34:58,954 --> 00:35:01,123
<i>you might be given the chance
to serve the Feudal Lord!</i>

410
00:35:03,162 --> 00:35:05,331
My cousin, Arashi...

411
00:35:06,264 --> 00:35:08,588
was an up and coming star
in the restoration of the clan...

412
00:35:09,762 --> 00:35:12,848
Arashi,
as a representative of the clan

413
00:35:13,047 --> 00:35:15,925
headed to the Hidden Sound Village
together with the emissary.

414
00:35:16,137 --> 00:35:16,991
But...

415
00:35:21,575 --> 00:35:22,296
And then...?

416
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:28,835
We waited for a notice from Arashi, but...

417
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,205
There's been no word from him, huh?

418
00:35:35,861 --> 00:35:39,281
Damn it!
He was tricked by that Orochimaru!

419
00:35:39,418 --> 00:35:40,418
Naruto!

420
00:35:43,345 --> 00:35:44,345
Oh...!

421
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:49,417
Uh, even so, your cousin Arashi
might be safe...

422
00:35:49,528 --> 00:35:52,406
We don't know, right?
And so...and so...

423
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,292
Idiot...!

424
00:35:53,494 --> 00:35:55,954
I'm going to save Arashi!

425
00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:01,326
I have a small body and
my power is weak.

426
00:36:01,684 --> 00:36:02,994
So no matter what I did...

427
00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:05,795
I did nothing but become a hindrance
even in ninjutsu training...

428
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:09,542
But Arashi always saved me!

429
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:13,843
Everyone in the village has
already given up, but...

430
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:17,507
I'll find the
Hidden Sound Village on my own...

431
00:36:18,901 --> 00:36:21,153
And so, you were chased by
the Sound ninja, right?

432
00:36:21,584 --> 00:36:24,837
This time, it's my turn to save Arashi!

433
00:36:26,849 --> 00:36:27,850
Sasame!

434
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:33,357
I...I want to be of help to Arashi!

435
00:36:35,134 --> 00:36:36,134
Naruto!

436
00:36:36,743 --> 00:36:39,329
Yeah...I know!

437
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:44,540
We have to go to the Sound Village
to bring back Sasuke anyway, so!

438
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,100
Now, instead of one,

439
00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:49,113
there are two guys
for us to bring back.

440
00:36:53,431 --> 00:36:57,060
I'll save your cousin, Sasame!

441
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:00,651
Right!

442
00:37:03,968 --> 00:37:05,136
Eew! A spider...

443
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:10,831
What's this?!

444
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,025
Naruto!

445
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,927
Wha! What's this?!

446
00:37:22,742 --> 00:37:24,661
<i>Ninja Art: Wind Spiders!</i>

447
00:37:26,527 --> 00:37:31,073
<i>My cute children made a path
for me out of silver thread</i>

448
00:37:31,297 --> 00:37:34,967
<i>and told me where you guys
were going.</i>

449
00:37:37,203 --> 00:37:43,251
<i>Now all three of you will descend
into hell while bearing this secret!</i>

450
00:37:49,274 --> 00:37:51,193
Naruto! It's the Ventriloquism Jutsu!

451
00:37:51,613 --> 00:37:53,382
He's scattering his voice
in multiple directions

452
00:37:53,472 --> 00:37:55,474
to cover up his location!

453
00:37:55,646 --> 00:37:58,607
I get it!
I'll leave the girl to you, Sakura!

454
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:03,990
<i>Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

455
00:38:14,149 --> 00:38:17,569
Okay! Bring it on from anywhere!

456
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:22,383
There's a lot of them,
but it's just the Clone jutsu.

457
00:38:22,457 --> 00:38:24,292
No. Look closely, Jigumo!

458
00:38:24,957 --> 00:38:26,750
The threads are getting tangled.

459
00:38:28,063 --> 00:38:31,817
The clones are tangible?!
Shadow clones?!

460
00:38:32,836 --> 00:38:35,214
If so...Kagero!

461
00:38:35,666 --> 00:38:36,918
Understood...

462
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,026
Come out!

463
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:48,438
<i>Born to be born, lived to live,
one sunrise and one sunset...</i>

464
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,411
<i>The life of a mayfly lasts but one day.</i>

465
00:38:51,508 --> 00:38:56,449
<i>Thinking that such a fleeting life
is pitiable is, in fact, pitiable...</i>

466
00:38:56,802 --> 00:38:58,387
<i>Know that I'm at my best</i>

467
00:38:58,477 --> 00:39:02,231
<i>when living in the dark and
deep in the ground!</i>

468
00:39:06,364 --> 00:39:07,628
<i>Ninja Art:</i>

469
00:39:07,841 --> 00:39:09,718
<i>Ant Lion Jutsu!</i>

470
00:39:21,431 --> 00:39:23,594
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

471
00:39:28,046 --> 00:39:29,357
Naruto! Grab on!

472
00:39:32,464 --> 00:39:33,715
Okay, pull him up!

473
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,161
There, eh?!

474
00:39:40,065 --> 00:39:41,817
Damn! It was a clone?!

475
00:39:42,666 --> 00:39:43,876
Over here!

476
00:39:44,646 --> 00:39:46,281
Time for our counterattack!

477
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:53,809
<i>Rasengan!</i>

478
00:39:54,289 --> 00:39:54,873
What?!

479
00:39:55,357 --> 00:39:56,859
You little...!

480
00:40:06,505 --> 00:40:07,171
Yes!

481
00:40:07,459 --> 00:40:10,587
Be careful, Naruto!
There are two others hiding!

482
00:40:12,541 --> 00:40:14,293
Hey, there they are!

483
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:16,134
Kagero!

484
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,623
Let's retreat for now!

485
00:40:19,272 --> 00:40:20,106
Hold it!

486
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:26,310
Th-They're totally quick
at running away!

487
00:40:35,143 --> 00:40:38,021
Naruto, why're you spacing out?!

488
00:40:39,402 --> 00:40:40,695
Where's Sakura?

489
00:40:40,885 --> 00:40:42,387
Oh! Oh, no!

490
00:40:43,751 --> 00:40:44,836
Sakura!

491
00:40:47,955 --> 00:40:49,514
Oh! Naruto...

492
00:40:50,152 --> 00:40:53,200
Thank goodness!
You're okay, Sasame.

493
00:40:54,831 --> 00:40:57,120
Yes...Sasame's okay.

494
00:40:57,536 --> 00:40:58,621
Sasame's totally okay.

495
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,121
What're you mad about?

496
00:41:08,345 --> 00:41:09,972
Let's take a break here.

497
00:41:12,767 --> 00:41:15,645
Sakura...Who's the cute girl?

498
00:41:16,036 --> 00:41:17,621
Okay! That's close enough...

499
00:41:18,034 --> 00:41:20,036
What's the deal...Sakura?

500
00:41:20,631 --> 00:41:22,842
Don't come any closer!

501
00:41:26,013 --> 00:41:29,545
Wh-What...I'm only interested
in adult women!

502
00:41:29,627 --> 00:41:31,128
You have me all wrong...!

503
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,479
Don't misunderstand!

504
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:34,717
It's not a misunderstanding.

505
00:41:34,828 --> 00:41:39,040
It seems Sakura's finally figured out
Pervy Sage's true nature!

506
00:41:39,509 --> 00:41:41,974
I told you to stop calling me
"Pervy Sage"!

507
00:41:42,075 --> 00:41:43,827
Then you're the Lewd Sage!

508
00:41:44,443 --> 00:41:48,262
Both of you stop it! Sasame's scared!

509
00:41:48,603 --> 00:41:49,603
- Okay.
- Okay.

510
00:41:50,556 --> 00:41:51,829
Jeez...

511
00:41:53,023 --> 00:41:54,427
This girl is Sasame...

512
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,413
She's a ninja from
the Land of Rice Paddies...

513
00:41:57,067 --> 00:41:58,532
A member of the Fuma Clan.

514
00:41:58,698 --> 00:42:01,309
She had her cousin taken away
by Orochimaru

515
00:42:01,486 --> 00:42:03,030
and was looking for his hideout.

516
00:42:03,362 --> 00:42:05,852
Right. And those ninja just now
were after Sasame

517
00:42:05,877 --> 00:42:09,092
in order to protect the secret
of the hideout!

518
00:42:09,523 --> 00:42:12,484
Oh...the Fuma Clan, huh?

519
00:42:12,631 --> 00:42:14,095
Huh?! You know?

520
00:42:14,545 --> 00:42:19,550
I had contact with ninja in the town
who'd left the Fuma Clan.

521
00:42:20,416 --> 00:42:25,213
What! So you were actually doing
some serious investigating, Pervy Sage?!

522
00:42:25,354 --> 00:42:27,356
I-I can't believe it...!

523
00:42:27,723 --> 00:42:30,392
Well you see, when I went to
this nice looking bar,

524
00:42:30,522 --> 00:42:33,776
it just so happened to be their hideout.

525
00:42:33,859 --> 00:42:37,321
What! So you were just hanging out
with some girls after all, right?

526
00:42:37,541 --> 00:42:40,669
You mustn't talk in a way that'll
lead to a misunderstanding!

527
00:42:41,064 --> 00:42:43,346
Even Sakura who respects me will...

528
00:42:43,666 --> 00:42:46,212
I've long since stopped respecting you!

529
00:42:46,627 --> 00:42:49,213
I...I see...

530
00:42:49,949 --> 00:42:51,534
Members of the Fuma Clan...?

531
00:42:52,186 --> 00:42:55,913
Yeah. The boss was called Hanzaki
or something...

532
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:59,326
Hanzaki and the others are traitors
who abandoned the clan.

533
00:43:00,117 --> 00:43:00,922
Oh...

534
00:43:01,304 --> 00:43:03,736
Did those people do something?

535
00:43:04,568 --> 00:43:07,722
They were after my travel money,
so I taught them a lesson.

536
00:43:07,992 --> 00:43:10,629
While I was at it, I attempted to
ask them about Orochimaru's hideout...

537
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,126
but they didn't know anything.

538
00:43:15,258 --> 00:43:19,846
I can show you the way to
Orochimaru's hideout.

539
00:43:20,463 --> 00:43:21,657
For real?!

540
00:43:21,752 --> 00:43:22,378
Yes...

541
00:43:22,992 --> 00:43:24,293
All right!

542
00:43:35,066 --> 00:43:37,944
Your wound hasn't healed yet.
Don't push yourself.

543
00:43:38,212 --> 00:43:40,130
Yes...but...

544
00:43:43,116 --> 00:43:45,576
This is the entrance to
the Hidden Sound Village.

545
00:43:46,183 --> 00:43:48,685
Orochimaru's hideout is deep
in those mountains...

546
00:43:55,006 --> 00:43:59,089
<i>I bet Sasuke is
somewhere in those mountains...</i>

547
00:43:59,709 --> 00:44:02,378
Okay, at last!

548
00:44:02,689 --> 00:44:04,116
Let's hurry!

549
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,343
Well, hold on...

550
00:44:07,935 --> 00:44:08,935
Why?!

551
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:13,525
If we don't hurry, night will fall before
we arrive at Orochimaru's hideout...

552
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:14,902
That's right!

553
00:44:15,101 --> 00:44:18,506
Sasuke is just a stone's throw away!
Pervy Sage!

554
00:44:18,958 --> 00:44:21,313
If we're going to save him,
we should do it as soon as possible!

555
00:44:21,883 --> 00:44:23,369
Why do we have to wait?!

556
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:26,208
Huh?

557
00:44:26,947 --> 00:44:27,515
What?

558
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:28,812
Gee...

559
00:44:30,266 --> 00:44:33,478
Well...I'm hungry, you see...

560
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:36,752
You know...All shinobi must...

561
00:44:36,777 --> 00:44:38,987
I can't fight if I'm hungry!

562
00:44:39,604 --> 00:44:42,142
We'll be entering full blown
enemy territory.

563
00:44:42,647 --> 00:44:45,984
We won't have time to
have relaxed meals, so...

564
00:44:47,826 --> 00:44:50,142
Okay, you guys eat too!

565
00:44:54,541 --> 00:44:57,864
Mm, this is good...

566
00:44:58,208 --> 00:45:01,381
You prepared this especially for us?

567
00:45:01,618 --> 00:45:07,666
No. It seems the prettiest girl
in the bar fell to my charm, you see.

568
00:45:09,966 --> 00:45:13,720
She made these with tender loving care.

569
00:45:15,955 --> 00:45:17,915
I'll go make some tea.

570
00:45:18,521 --> 00:45:20,357
Oh...thanks...

571
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,458
Tastes pretty good.

572
00:45:43,592 --> 00:45:45,204
Tea is ready.

573
00:45:48,523 --> 00:45:49,397
Here you go!

574
00:45:51,118 --> 00:45:51,807
Here you go.

575
00:45:51,985 --> 00:45:53,028
Thanks...

576
00:45:53,704 --> 00:45:54,413
Here you go.

577
00:45:54,728 --> 00:45:56,397
Thank you, Sasame...

578
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:01,925
Sasame, you should eat with us too.

579
00:46:02,462 --> 00:46:03,207
Okay...

580
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:30,205
Pervy Sage...What's wrong...?!

581
00:46:32,026 --> 00:46:33,026
Naruto!

582
00:47:07,989 --> 00:47:10,575
Sasame did it...

583
00:47:11,244 --> 00:47:13,287
Since it's come to this, they're ours.

584
00:47:16,843 --> 00:47:18,386
Your wound still hasn't healed.

585
00:47:18,931 --> 00:47:21,359
Kagero, you wait here.

586
00:47:21,726 --> 00:47:25,438
No mistake...They're Leaf ninja.

587
00:47:26,612 --> 00:47:29,103
If we take care of the Leaf pursuers...

588
00:47:29,672 --> 00:47:34,135
Lord Orochimaru will surely acknowledge
the power of the Fuma Clan.

589
00:47:35,108 --> 00:47:36,108
Yeah...

590
00:47:36,848 --> 00:47:39,111
Let's go back with good news.

591
00:47:39,594 --> 00:47:41,846
And with the heads of
the Leaf ninja as souvenirs!

592
00:48:23,658 --> 00:48:24,825
I finally found it!

593
00:48:34,697 --> 00:48:37,217
At first, I thought it was someone
from the Hidden Leaf Village.

594
00:48:37,901 --> 00:48:40,070
But it's Sasame, believe it or not...

595
00:48:41,363 --> 00:48:43,865
Kamikiri, Jigumo, Kagero...

596
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:46,131
This is an odd reunion.

597
00:48:48,881 --> 00:48:52,176
Where's Arashi?!
He wasn't with all you guys?!

598
00:48:55,123 --> 00:49:01,045
Arashi is serving near Lord Orochimaru
and is spending his days training.

599
00:49:02,462 --> 00:49:04,804
Can I see Arashi?!

600
00:49:05,191 --> 00:49:09,713
If you're also going to work together
with us for Lord Orochimaru,

601
00:49:10,071 --> 00:49:11,739
I'm sure you'll be able to see him.

602
00:49:23,165 --> 00:49:24,332
How'd it go?

603
00:49:29,533 --> 00:49:30,984
You've done well.

604
00:49:31,158 --> 00:49:33,869
Now I'll be able to see Arashi, right?

605
00:49:35,774 --> 00:49:38,943
After we've finished them off!

606
00:49:40,165 --> 00:49:43,455
Why?! Weren't we just supposed to
take them to Lord Orochimaru

607
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,482
for examination after capturing them?!

608
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:49,152
We only need the heads
for the examination.

609
00:49:50,823 --> 00:49:51,622
No!

610
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:54,194
These people...for my sake...!

611
00:49:54,219 --> 00:49:55,109
Move it!

612
00:49:58,347 --> 00:49:59,115
- Wha?!
- Huh?!

613
00:50:04,016 --> 00:50:04,506
What?!

614
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:06,920
The Fuma numbing medicine
didn't work!

615
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:10,425
We knew about it all along
from the beginning!

616
00:50:11,257 --> 00:50:12,300
Sakura!

617
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:20,606
<i>Substitution...?!</i>

618
00:50:20,992 --> 00:50:22,160
I leave Sasame to you!

619
00:50:22,314 --> 00:50:23,315
Right!

620
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,483
Sasame...Hang in there!

621
00:50:32,308 --> 00:50:36,786
Why? Why does Sasame have
to do something like this?!

622
00:50:37,511 --> 00:50:39,803
No, it's not that she's doing it
against her will...

623
00:50:39,844 --> 00:50:42,138
It's something she wanted to do!

624
00:50:42,443 --> 00:50:43,294
Liar!

625
00:50:44,472 --> 00:50:45,640
It's true...

626
00:50:46,909 --> 00:50:47,718
What...

627
00:50:48,292 --> 00:50:50,814
What should I do to be able
to see Arashi again?

628
00:50:50,926 --> 00:50:52,710
It's not a difficult thing.

629
00:50:53,135 --> 00:50:56,680
You just have to bring us the ones
who infiltrated the Land of Rice Paddies.

630
00:50:57,709 --> 00:50:58,613
We have to kill them...?!

631
00:50:58,807 --> 00:51:02,008
We'll take them back to Lord Orochimaru
for examination.

632
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:03,683
So we're not going to kill, right?

633
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:08,156
If we carry that out,
Lord Orochimaru will acknowledge us.

634
00:51:10,298 --> 00:51:14,385
Hanzaki says that Arashi and everyone
are being tricked by Orochimaru.

635
00:51:14,816 --> 00:51:16,984
He says that you'll just be used
and thrown away...

636
00:51:17,171 --> 00:51:20,549
Hanzaki's a traitor
who abandoned the village.

637
00:51:21,125 --> 00:51:23,127
Will you believe what we say?

638
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,834
Or will you believe what a traitor says?

639
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:30,916
Lord Orochimaru will surely restore
our Fuma Clan...

640
00:51:33,769 --> 00:51:38,523
Sasame, although you're still young,
you're also one of the Fuma.

641
00:51:39,507 --> 00:51:42,844
Assist us in the restoration
of our Clan...

642
00:51:49,666 --> 00:51:51,899
So you guys did trick Sasame!

643
00:51:52,248 --> 00:51:54,793
It's all for the restoration
of the Fuma Clan!

644
00:51:59,165 --> 00:52:00,165
You little!

645
00:52:06,649 --> 00:52:07,914
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

646
00:52:08,522 --> 00:52:09,607
Here I go!

647
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:10,293
Wha!

648
00:52:10,521 --> 00:52:13,274
U-zu-ma-ki...!

649
00:52:18,194 --> 00:52:19,703
Naruto Barrage!

650
00:52:22,273 --> 00:52:23,774
<i>This is bad...!</i>

651
00:52:33,683 --> 00:52:35,226
<i>Rasengan!</i>

652
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:47,789
This is for Sasame.
Prepare yourselves!

653
00:52:48,944 --> 00:52:49,944
Naruto!

654
00:52:55,913 --> 00:52:58,290
You're...from before?!

655
00:52:58,883 --> 00:53:00,885
This is the Earth Style user, huh?

656
00:53:01,538 --> 00:53:06,678
However, there's no point to
using it in this rocky area.

657
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:12,606
Indeed, the Ant Lion appears from
inside the ground

658
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:15,041
and the spreading of its wings under
the sunlight is

659
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:17,152
but a momentary gleam.

660
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:21,310
That's when I die as Kagero!

661
00:53:25,188 --> 00:53:26,115
Be careful!

662
00:53:33,721 --> 00:53:35,681
What's this...?

663
00:53:37,121 --> 00:53:38,289
Look! Naruto...

664
00:53:45,546 --> 00:53:46,500
Wha?!

665
00:53:58,303 --> 00:53:59,753
U-Unbelievable!

666
00:53:59,894 --> 00:54:01,709
You were a woman...?!

667
00:54:03,457 --> 00:54:06,098
The clan will once again be
in a place lit by the sunlight...

668
00:54:07,206 --> 00:54:10,209
Lord Orochimaru promised that...

669
00:54:11,008 --> 00:54:15,405
I'll use this once in a lifetime jutsu
if it's for the sake of that.

670
00:54:20,647 --> 00:54:22,886
<i>Kagero's Ninja Art: Ephemera!</i>

671
00:54:26,801 --> 00:54:28,344
Naruto! Come with me!

672
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:36,746
Naruto!

673
00:54:53,348 --> 00:54:57,101
I-I feel like...
I've seen this before...

674
00:54:57,879 --> 00:55:00,381
It's the Toad Mouth Trap Jutsu.

675
00:55:00,816 --> 00:55:03,139
I summoned the extraordinarily
sturdy stomach of

676
00:55:03,164 --> 00:55:05,687
Mount Myoboku's
Iwajuku Giant Toad.

677
00:55:06,379 --> 00:55:07,403
Stomach...?

678
00:55:10,322 --> 00:55:11,089
Yikes!

679
00:55:11,533 --> 00:55:13,451
It's melting...

680
00:55:13,569 --> 00:55:14,703
If I didn't do this,

681
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:17,291
we wouldn't have been able to
defend ourselves from her chakra.

682
00:55:34,627 --> 00:55:39,110
I believed...that the clan
would someday...

683
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:41,169
I believed in that.

684
00:55:51,275 --> 00:55:53,152
Sh-She vanished.

685
00:55:54,301 --> 00:55:55,678
I've got to hand it to her.

686
00:55:56,202 --> 00:55:58,511
She put her life on the line

687
00:55:58,536 --> 00:56:00,511
and attempted to save her comrades...

688
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:04,001
It's unforgivable!

689
00:56:06,617 --> 00:56:09,786
Those guys...
the Fuma ninja...

690
00:56:10,249 --> 00:56:13,669
Their feelings toward their clan
are the same as our feelings!

691
00:56:14,436 --> 00:56:19,311
Manipulating the Fuma's desire
to restore their clan...

692
00:56:21,235 --> 00:56:25,781
I'll kick Orochimaru's butt,
no matter what!

693
00:56:43,811 --> 00:56:45,312
Wh-Where are we?

694
00:56:46,908 --> 00:56:47,799
Kagero!

695
00:56:48,389 --> 00:56:52,890
You risked your life to save us?

696
00:56:57,584 --> 00:56:58,877
You idiot...

697
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:17,599
Please...

698
00:57:18,564 --> 00:57:21,406
Please use your Medical Ninjutsu
to save her.

699
00:57:21,887 --> 00:57:25,503
Our comrade doesn't have
long to live!

700
00:57:26,847 --> 00:57:31,102
Put your hands to your chests and think.

701
00:57:32,054 --> 00:57:36,604
Think about what you weren't
able to accomplish...okay?

702
00:57:36,948 --> 00:57:42,208
We risked our lives working for you...
to help you, Lord Orochimaru.

703
00:57:42,688 --> 00:57:44,811
In order to restore the Fuma Clan!

704
00:57:44,969 --> 00:57:47,221
Please recognize our work!

705
00:57:48,852 --> 00:57:54,204
You'll just have to atone for
your failure with your bodies.

706
00:58:00,506 --> 00:58:01,799
Lord Orochimaru!

707
00:58:03,301 --> 00:58:04,508
I'm sorry for the betrayal!

708
00:58:26,796 --> 00:58:28,354
How did the Pervy Sage,

709
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:31,900
who was once so easily defeated by
Old Lady Tsunade's numbing medicine

710
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:35,011
detect Sasame's medicine this time?

711
00:58:35,728 --> 00:58:38,856
Isn't it strange that
Master Jiraiya's that sharp?

712
00:58:39,267 --> 00:58:40,402
Hey, hey...

713
00:58:41,153 --> 00:58:45,157
Remember when Sasame talked
about Hanzaki and said he's a traitor?

714
00:58:45,535 --> 00:58:46,908
That's how I knew...

715
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:51,402
Hanzaki told me everything...

716
00:58:53,384 --> 00:58:57,805
<i>When Orochimaru came to this land,
there were those among us</i>

717
00:58:58,009 --> 00:59:01,846
<i>who wanted to use his strength
to revive the clan</i>

718
00:59:02,346 --> 00:59:07,304
<i>and those that saw his evil intent
and said we should not join him.</i>

719
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:12,700
<i>Hmm...so that's why you guys
were chased out of your village.</i>

720
00:59:13,211 --> 00:59:20,186
<i>Yes. It was probably Orochimaru's idea
to chase us out of the village</i>

721
00:59:20,864 --> 00:59:24,406
<i>as traitors who were getting
in the way of reviving the clan.</i>

722
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:30,358
When Sasame called Hanzaki a traitor,

723
00:59:30,899 --> 00:59:35,195
I knew that Sasame had ties to a group
that was on Orochimaru's side.

724
00:59:43,355 --> 00:59:44,606
Fool!

725
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:45,974
Hey, Pervy Sage!

726
00:59:46,202 --> 00:59:48,037
Just wait a minute!

727
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:49,627
I'm prepared!

728
00:59:51,632 --> 00:59:56,845
Sasame, you did it so that
you could meet Arashi...Isn't that right?

729
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:03,766
I'm sorry...
that was the only thing I could do.

730
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:05,710
Master Jiraiya!

731
01:00:06,217 --> 01:00:09,220
Sasame did it only because
she wanted to see her cousin.

732
01:00:10,247 --> 01:00:11,462
Please forgive her!

733
01:00:11,646 --> 01:00:13,808
I'm asking you to forgive her too!

734
01:00:14,269 --> 01:00:16,729
The law of the shinobi
is a strict thing...

735
01:00:19,898 --> 01:00:23,360
I can't just acquit her like this.

736
01:00:27,015 --> 01:00:30,310
Then punish me first!

737
01:00:31,934 --> 01:00:37,648
I promised I'd help Sasame
see her cousin Arashi!

738
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:41,846
If I don't fulfill that I'll have
twisted my Ninja Way!

739
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:44,265
Master Jiraiya, me too!

740
01:00:44,561 --> 01:00:48,712
Now now, wait a minute!
It's not as if I'm gonna eat her alive.

741
01:00:48,976 --> 01:00:49,692
- Huh?!
- Oh?

742
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:54,525
Sasame, Hanzaki was worried that

743
01:00:54,805 --> 01:00:58,210
you might leave your village to
look for Arashi...

744
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:14,087
After you escort us to
Orochimaru's hideout,

745
01:01:14,358 --> 01:01:16,498
you'll immediately head to
the inn where Hanzaki is

746
01:01:16,854 --> 01:01:19,211
and wait there for our return.

747
01:01:20,202 --> 01:01:22,580
That is the punishment given to you.

748
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:24,976
Master Jiraiya...

749
01:01:25,222 --> 01:01:27,308
Pervy Sage,
I've gotta give you more credit!

750
01:01:27,338 --> 01:01:28,964
Thank you, Master Jiraiya!

751
01:01:29,671 --> 01:01:35,833
Well, Hanzaki treated me to
a lot of special service at the Fuma Bar

752
01:01:35,881 --> 01:01:38,724
and asked me to look after Sasame...

753
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,477
I thought it was something
like that anyway!

754
01:01:42,524 --> 01:01:44,693
I feel cheated that
I gave you more credit!

755
01:01:44,817 --> 01:01:48,156
He, hey...
It's all right once in a while, right?

756
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:51,107
There's something called
socializing for adults...

757
01:02:06,285 --> 01:02:06,998
There it is...

758
01:02:08,005 --> 01:02:09,892
Leave the rest to us.

759
01:02:10,512 --> 01:02:13,107
Sasame, be careful going back
to the inn.

760
01:02:13,994 --> 01:02:19,291
Don't worry!
I will absolutely bring Arashi back!

761
01:02:23,545 --> 01:02:25,606
Please take care of Arashi!

762
01:02:26,081 --> 01:02:27,407
Leave it to me!

763
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:30,663
Just wait, and rest assured that
I'll do everything I can!

764
01:02:31,506 --> 01:02:34,425
Stop getting so carried away Naruto,
you idiot!

765
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:35,876
Oww!

766
01:02:44,289 --> 01:02:45,095
<i>That's where...</i>

767
01:02:48,279 --> 01:02:49,279
<i>Sasuke is...!</i>

768
01:02:53,710 --> 01:02:55,712
So this is the only entrance...

769
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:58,649
If they're lying in wait,
we'll be picked off.

770
01:02:59,008 --> 01:03:01,719
There's nothing we can do but go!

771
01:03:02,194 --> 01:03:03,779
Well, don't panic.

772
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:07,492
If three large rats go, we'll stand out.

773
01:03:08,109 --> 01:03:10,695
First, let's send out one
that won't stand out.

774
01:03:12,879 --> 01:03:14,381
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

775
01:03:20,327 --> 01:03:20,909
Hey!

776
01:03:21,107 --> 01:03:24,694
Th-The frog spoke!

777
01:03:24,959 --> 01:03:29,046
Hey, it's been a while!
Sakura, this is Gamakichi.

778
01:03:30,634 --> 01:03:31,603
Gamakichi?!

779
01:03:32,444 --> 01:03:34,902
I wanted to ask you to do
some reconnaissance.

780
01:03:35,208 --> 01:03:39,732
All right! That's a simple task.
Leave it to me!

781
01:03:42,758 --> 01:03:45,714
I can't help it,
frogs give me the creeps...

782
01:03:52,536 --> 01:03:54,872
There doesn't seem
to be anything fishy...

783
01:03:56,277 --> 01:03:58,709
There doesn't seem to be
a trap at the entrance.

784
01:04:05,098 --> 01:04:06,175
<i>Arashi...</i>

785
01:04:16,164 --> 01:04:19,167
There's nothing to it around here.

786
01:04:33,538 --> 01:04:34,304
Hmm...

787
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:36,071
What shall we do?

788
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:39,250
It seems there's no choice
but to split up into three.

789
01:04:39,664 --> 01:04:42,667
My instinct tells me
it's the middle one!

790
01:04:42,846 --> 01:04:43,525
Wait!

791
01:04:44,196 --> 01:04:45,196
What the heck?!

792
01:04:46,133 --> 01:04:48,733
At times like this, it's especially
important to move carefully...

793
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:01,511
All right, I'll go this way!

794
01:05:03,016 --> 01:05:03,958
That's it?!

795
01:05:04,036 --> 01:05:07,206
So what's so different from
my instinct and that, Pervy Sage?

796
01:05:07,489 --> 01:05:09,900
Well, it's a question of feeling...

797
01:05:10,734 --> 01:05:14,299
If you haven't found anything
after 30 minutes, come back.

798
01:05:14,774 --> 01:05:15,462
Got it?

799
01:05:16,070 --> 01:05:16,787
Yeah...

800
01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:22,168
Naruto, Sakura, the two of you
should proceed together.

801
01:05:23,641 --> 01:05:27,061
Listen, from this point forward,
it's the first avenue of hell.

802
01:05:27,645 --> 01:05:29,611
A demon might appear,
or a snake might appear.

803
01:05:29,925 --> 01:05:31,506
Take them on mindfully!

804
01:05:32,025 --> 01:05:32,803
Yup!

805
01:05:35,195 --> 01:05:36,113
I understand!

806
01:05:38,347 --> 01:05:40,725
We're going down the middle!

807
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:43,614
Then I'm going this way...

808
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:45,023
See ya...

809
01:05:57,701 --> 01:06:00,328
Hmm...the smell of face powder.

810
01:06:06,687 --> 01:06:08,704
I'm being invited in...

811
01:06:08,905 --> 01:06:12,534
In that case, it might be good fun
to accept the invitation.

812
01:06:28,305 --> 01:06:29,209
What...?

813
01:06:34,191 --> 01:06:36,701
Because guests would be
arriving from far away,

814
01:06:36,841 --> 01:06:41,539
I was directed by Lord Orochimaru
to entertain.

815
01:06:42,653 --> 01:06:45,364
I'm guessing
it's a type of fox raccoon ghost...

816
01:06:46,421 --> 01:06:49,215
If you're saying
I'm some raccoon or fox,

817
01:06:49,651 --> 01:06:54,901
you ought to come over here
and check to see if I have a tail or not.

818
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:59,711
Oh, this path was right on...

819
01:07:00,774 --> 01:07:02,598
How about yours, Naruto?

820
01:07:05,513 --> 01:07:07,913
Sakura, be careful!

821
01:07:08,635 --> 01:07:11,013
There's no telling what sort
of traps there might be...

822
01:07:11,374 --> 01:07:11,908
Yeah...

823
01:07:13,389 --> 01:07:14,707
- Oh?!
- Naruto?!

824
01:07:16,754 --> 01:07:18,743
And you were the one who
said to be careful!

825
01:07:19,115 --> 01:07:21,242
It was an ingenious trap floor!

826
01:07:26,193 --> 01:07:26,719
Oh!

827
01:07:27,005 --> 01:07:29,132
What the hell is next!

828
01:07:31,909 --> 01:07:32,909
Sakura!

829
01:07:36,208 --> 01:07:37,208
Naruto!

830
01:07:43,809 --> 01:07:45,227
It's my fault...

831
01:07:46,795 --> 01:07:47,921
Naruto!

832
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:49,774
What the hell...

833
01:07:54,111 --> 01:07:56,113
I can't get out...

834
01:07:56,454 --> 01:07:57,580
What're you doing?!

835
01:07:57,804 --> 01:08:00,891
You screamed in such
a misleading way, I totally thought...

836
01:08:01,441 --> 01:08:03,193
Give me a hand!

837
01:08:04,057 --> 01:08:05,600
You're really a handful!

838
01:08:08,207 --> 01:08:09,126
Ya saved me...

839
01:08:09,311 --> 01:08:11,611
Really! I'll go first!

840
01:08:24,572 --> 01:08:25,345
Naruto...

841
01:08:27,304 --> 01:08:29,230
It's all right now.

842
01:08:29,958 --> 01:08:31,001
Here!

843
01:08:34,586 --> 01:08:35,292
Huh?!

844
01:08:47,603 --> 01:08:48,728
Naruto!

845
01:08:50,138 --> 01:08:51,084
Naruto!

846
01:08:52,901 --> 01:08:54,296
Naruto!

847
01:08:55,350 --> 01:08:57,383
Sakura...

848
01:08:58,421 --> 01:09:00,845
Naruto?! Are you all right?

849
01:09:02,756 --> 01:09:04,424
Don't worry about me.

850
01:09:04,881 --> 01:09:07,633
You need to hurry and
get out of this trap hallway!

851
01:09:08,057 --> 01:09:08,810
But...

852
01:09:09,134 --> 01:09:13,023
I said go! I'll follow behind for sure!

853
01:09:14,407 --> 01:09:15,114
Really?

854
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:18,443
Yeah...I'll catch up in no time!

855
01:09:24,501 --> 01:09:25,612
You'd better come, no matter what.

856
01:09:26,643 --> 01:09:27,811
It's a promise, you know...

857
01:09:35,649 --> 01:09:38,510
<i>The sake doesn't seem
tampered with.</i>

858
01:09:39,423 --> 01:09:42,202
<i>So what kind of plot has she prepared...?</i>

859
01:09:46,405 --> 01:09:48,494
Just as I'd expect from
the Hidden Sound...

860
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:52,313
Are you planning to use ninjutsu
on me with music?

861
01:09:53,575 --> 01:09:58,444
The music isn't only for guests.
It's for myself...

862
01:09:59,013 --> 01:09:59,904
I see...

863
01:10:00,910 --> 01:10:03,365
What do you play for your heart?

864
01:10:07,423 --> 01:10:10,331
Music for my own funeral...

865
01:10:19,423 --> 01:10:22,843
Trying to seduce me...
You've underestimated this Jiraiya!

866
01:10:48,214 --> 01:10:53,099
Escorting the guest to
the underworld is my last mission.

867
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,126
A suspended ceiling?!

868
01:11:02,387 --> 01:11:04,706
I need to hurry up
and get out of this place!

869
01:11:06,004 --> 01:11:07,297
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

870
01:11:10,113 --> 01:11:11,156
This is torture!

871
01:11:12,309 --> 01:11:13,894
What the hell?!

872
01:11:14,084 --> 01:11:15,437
Give me a hand!

873
01:11:15,831 --> 01:11:18,667
We need to build up our chakra
and create the Rasengan!

874
01:11:18,902 --> 01:11:20,404
Don't be absurd!

875
01:11:20,937 --> 01:11:23,273
We can't stretch
our bodies beyond this!

876
01:11:24,321 --> 01:11:26,102
My muscles are cramping up!

877
01:11:26,127 --> 01:11:28,795
Man! I've gotta do something...

878
01:11:29,902 --> 01:11:30,602
- What!
- Huh?!

879
01:11:32,279 --> 01:11:33,080
What?!

880
01:11:33,105 --> 01:11:34,106
- Water?!
- Water!

881
01:11:47,951 --> 01:11:49,221
Looks like I've been saved.

882
01:11:51,096 --> 01:11:52,850
Hey, get outta my way!

883
01:11:53,306 --> 01:11:55,311
Oh, it's you, Naruto.

884
01:11:55,991 --> 01:11:58,806
Gamakichi, is there
a way out somewhere?

885
01:11:59,308 --> 01:12:03,980
Don't know!
I was flushed down here too.

886
01:12:06,711 --> 01:12:08,421
So it's no good...

887
01:12:09,042 --> 01:12:10,603
Hey, are you all right?

888
01:12:11,198 --> 01:12:13,158
How could I be all right!

889
01:12:36,210 --> 01:12:37,811
Naruto's taking a long time.

890
01:12:39,052 --> 01:12:40,314
Maybe I should go back...

891
01:13:21,898 --> 01:13:25,192
It's admirable that
you made it this far, Sakura.

892
01:13:26,149 --> 01:13:27,776
Is that Kabuto's voice?!

893
01:13:29,301 --> 01:13:30,594
Isn't it ironic?

894
01:13:31,784 --> 01:13:35,653
During the Chunin Exam
in the Hidden Leaf Village,

895
01:13:35,678 --> 01:13:38,330
you were the only one
that dragged the team down,

896
01:13:38,592 --> 01:13:40,749
and yet you're the one
to make it this far.

897
01:13:41,276 --> 01:13:42,402
I'm not by myself!

898
01:13:43,239 --> 01:13:45,575
Naruto and Master Jiraiya
will be here right away!

899
01:13:46,595 --> 01:13:49,515
Where's Sasuke?
He's all right, isn't he?

900
01:13:50,901 --> 01:13:54,738
Shouldn't you be worried about
Naruto and Master Jiraiya,

901
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:57,104
and not Sasuke?

902
01:14:00,421 --> 01:14:05,198
Well, it may very well be that those two
are no longer in this world anymore.

903
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:07,010
No way...

904
01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:13,200
There's no way Master Jiraiya and Naruto
would be taken down that easily!

905
01:14:13,765 --> 01:14:15,475
I wonder if that's so?

906
01:14:16,509 --> 01:14:20,605
Maybe you dragged Naruto
down like you always do?

907
01:14:23,295 --> 01:14:24,208
So I'm right...

908
01:14:25,893 --> 01:14:26,794
Naruto...

909
01:14:32,773 --> 01:14:35,205
If you're worried
you should go and see...

910
01:14:37,456 --> 01:14:40,311
Or perhaps you're afraid
of me attacking

911
01:14:40,506 --> 01:14:42,800
and you can't come out
from behind the pillar.

912
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:47,524
If someone like you were
on my team,

913
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:50,402
I don't know how many lives
I would need.

914
01:14:50,806 --> 01:14:51,849
<i>I can too...</i>

915
01:14:52,279 --> 01:14:53,280
I can too!

916
01:15:03,462 --> 01:15:04,416
<i>Substitution Jutsu?!</i>

917
01:15:07,236 --> 01:15:08,253
Substitution again?!

918
01:15:13,058 --> 01:15:15,010
I can too...
When I fight, I fight!

919
01:15:16,618 --> 01:15:18,847
As I thought, this is all you've got...

920
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:23,227
It's about time I put an end to this.

921
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:28,315
I can't keep Lord Orochimaru waiting
any longer, you see.

922
01:15:29,566 --> 01:15:30,509
<i>Orochimaru?!</i>

923
01:15:33,317 --> 01:15:37,032
No! I'm different from how
I was...back then!

924
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:41,078
I wonder if that's true...

925
01:15:54,628 --> 01:15:55,424
It can't be...

926
01:15:58,493 --> 01:16:01,014
Even if you put up a bluff,
I can foresee...

927
01:16:02,368 --> 01:16:05,705
You are already...finished.

928
01:16:35,627 --> 01:16:36,810
Poor thing.

929
01:16:38,235 --> 01:16:41,238
This child is trembling
like a puppy

930
01:16:42,087 --> 01:16:43,299
Now, Kabuto...

931
01:16:43,833 --> 01:16:46,705
Get rid of her,
but don't make her suffer.

932
01:16:47,239 --> 01:16:47,895
I understand.

933
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:51,981
Wait!

934
01:16:52,597 --> 01:16:53,213
Hmm?

935
01:16:54,234 --> 01:16:56,695
Did you...say something?

936
01:16:57,187 --> 01:16:58,104
Wait!

937
01:17:01,151 --> 01:17:03,737
Where's Sasuke!
Where is Sasuke?

938
01:17:04,336 --> 01:17:07,506
It couldn't be that...
your body is already Sasuke's...?

939
01:17:08,615 --> 01:17:11,114
There's no need to keep it
a secret any longer.

940
01:17:12,289 --> 01:17:16,459
It's all right, Kabuto,
go on and tell her.

941
01:17:25,004 --> 01:17:27,313
He was a little late
in getting here.

942
01:17:28,518 --> 01:17:30,907
Lord Orochimaru wasn't able to
wait for Sasuke,

943
01:17:31,393 --> 01:17:34,001
and already had been reincarnated
into another vessel.

944
01:17:34,514 --> 01:17:38,852
So Sasuke is all right?!
Somewhere in this building...

945
01:17:39,465 --> 01:17:42,969
Lord Orochimaru gave Sasuke
the Curse Mark,

946
01:17:43,665 --> 01:17:46,310
so he could wait for
the next opportunity to reincarnate.

947
01:17:47,611 --> 01:17:48,537
But...

948
01:17:49,142 --> 01:17:52,715
Not all humans can
tolerate Curse Marks.

949
01:17:54,593 --> 01:17:57,381
No way, there's no way
that Sasuke could be...

950
01:17:58,147 --> 01:18:02,379
That's right, Sasuke wasn't able
to tolerate the Curse Mark

951
01:18:02,404 --> 01:18:03,405
and so he died.

952
01:18:03,812 --> 01:18:06,098
That's a lie.

953
01:18:07,507 --> 01:18:08,606
It has to be a lie!

954
01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:14,408
What would telling a lie
like that accomplish?

955
01:18:14,865 --> 01:18:18,568
To someone that's going to die,
that is...

956
01:18:19,694 --> 01:18:22,513
If you want to see him that badly
I'll let you see him.

957
01:18:23,034 --> 01:18:25,213
When you die, you can see him
in the afterlife.

958
01:18:53,744 --> 01:18:54,744
<i>Sasuke...</i>

959
01:18:57,186 --> 01:18:58,353
Sakura!

960
01:19:01,221 --> 01:19:03,891
Sakura, don't you believe...

961
01:19:06,014 --> 01:19:07,223
what a guy like him says!

962
01:19:07,458 --> 01:19:08,198
Naruto!

963
01:19:08,803 --> 01:19:13,210
So it's Naruto, I thought you'd drowned
and died a long time ago but...

964
01:19:13,888 --> 01:19:16,098
When I make a promise
I don't give up.

965
01:19:16,273 --> 01:19:17,733
That's my Ninja Way!

966
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:21,606
I ain't gonna die,
until I get Sasuke back!

967
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:24,551
This is interesting!

968
01:19:28,466 --> 01:19:29,801
Sakura, go hide!

969
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:35,056
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

970
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:39,961
I'm over here!

971
01:19:41,451 --> 01:19:43,996
Hey stupid, over here!
Over here, over here!

972
01:19:44,799 --> 01:19:47,593
Where're you looking?
I'm over here! Over here!

973
01:19:48,878 --> 01:19:50,922
What're you doing? Hey!

974
01:20:03,441 --> 01:20:05,402
So you've used up all
your kunai knives...

975
01:20:07,009 --> 01:20:11,638
I'm gonna...completely blow you away!

976
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:30,205
How annoying!

977
01:20:31,286 --> 01:20:32,231
<i>Fire Style:</i>

978
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:34,008
<i>Misty Flames Dance Jutsu!</i>

979
01:20:38,111 --> 01:20:41,753
- Ouch!
- That's hot!

980
01:20:43,547 --> 01:20:45,966
- Yikes!
- Oww!

981
01:20:58,339 --> 01:20:59,995
You're too slow!

982
01:21:01,273 --> 01:21:02,164
<i>Rasengan!</i>

983
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:17,412
Naruto!

984
01:21:22,874 --> 01:21:26,093
Since you and Orochimaru are here,

985
01:21:26,523 --> 01:21:28,400
it means Sasuke is probably here too!

986
01:21:28,965 --> 01:21:31,008
Tell us the truth right now!

987
01:21:37,851 --> 01:21:41,729
Wh-What the heck?
My body won't move...

988
01:21:44,959 --> 01:21:48,290
Have a good look at yourself.

989
01:21:51,074 --> 01:21:52,867
Wh-What's this?

990
01:21:53,228 --> 01:21:55,313
Those are chakra threads.

991
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:56,713
Chakra threads?

992
01:21:59,114 --> 01:22:01,367
While you were attacking earlier,

993
01:22:02,093 --> 01:22:04,419
I wrapped the thread around you.

994
01:22:05,931 --> 01:22:10,312
Take a good look at where
that thread is connected.

995
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:16,206
That's right.

996
01:22:16,845 --> 01:22:18,706
Those chakra threads are...

997
01:22:20,843 --> 01:22:23,810
connected to my heart's
chakra network.

998
01:22:25,357 --> 01:22:29,095
And Naruto, the thread that's
wrapped around you

999
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:34,750
is connected through my chakra network
to your organs and to your heart.

1000
01:22:38,703 --> 01:22:40,768
See, can you hear that?

1001
01:22:41,714 --> 01:22:46,719
My heart and your heart will
eventually become connected as one!

1002
01:22:48,183 --> 01:22:49,851
- Damn!
- Naruto!

1003
01:22:52,498 --> 01:22:56,406
It's no use. That thread is formulated
and spun with chakra...

1004
01:22:56,816 --> 01:22:58,435
It absolutely will not break.

1005
01:23:03,330 --> 01:23:08,007
Now our hearts are
completely synchronized...

1006
01:23:09,152 --> 01:23:12,295
The chakra which passes
through this thread

1007
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:17,575
via the chakra network from my heart
is controlling your heart, you see.

1008
01:23:18,857 --> 01:23:21,413
<i>It's no use, even though
it's my heart...</i>

1009
01:23:22,136 --> 01:23:26,334
If my heart beat gets faster,
your heart will get faster too...

1010
01:23:27,085 --> 01:23:30,171
And when my heart stops beating...

1011
01:23:31,735 --> 01:23:33,091
You will die too!

1012
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:38,444
Don't! If you stop your heart,
you'll die too!

1013
01:23:39,193 --> 01:23:43,030
That's right.
But that doesn't mean much.

1014
01:23:43,703 --> 01:23:47,873
Since I've already promised
my body to Lord Orochimaru...

1015
01:24:09,919 --> 01:24:12,589
Wh-What the heck are
you gonna do?!

1016
01:24:14,799 --> 01:24:17,093
If I crush this heart...

1017
01:24:19,016 --> 01:24:21,615
you will die too!

1018
01:24:22,686 --> 01:24:25,307
Now, together we will...

1019
01:24:28,104 --> 01:24:28,809
Naruto!

1020
01:24:29,247 --> 01:24:33,193
How's it feel to have
your heart seized?

1021
01:24:33,997 --> 01:24:34,802
It'll be all right...

1022
01:24:35,361 --> 01:24:37,197
You'll be out of your misery
right away!

1023
01:24:44,603 --> 01:24:45,497
Stop it!

1024
01:24:46,911 --> 01:24:51,711
How foolish, if you kill me
Naruto will die too.

1025
01:24:52,297 --> 01:24:53,099
What I'm gonna cut...

1026
01:24:54,104 --> 01:24:54,908
is this!

1027
01:25:00,237 --> 01:25:01,489
There's no use you know,

1028
01:25:01,971 --> 01:25:06,184
It's impossible to cut thread formulated
and made from chakra.

1029
01:25:12,338 --> 01:25:16,173
Even Lady Tsunade's great strength
wouldn't be able to break it.

1030
01:25:23,201 --> 01:25:26,246
<i>What should I...
What should I do?!</i>

1031
01:25:26,886 --> 01:25:29,086
<i>Naruto is suffering right
in front of my eyes and yet...</i>

1032
01:25:29,623 --> 01:25:31,917
<i>I can't do anything!</i>

1033
01:25:35,089 --> 01:25:37,133
Sakura...!

1034
01:25:39,417 --> 01:25:42,420
I...absolutely will not lose!

1035
01:25:44,262 --> 01:25:46,474
Until I've fulfilled my promise!

1036
01:25:48,565 --> 01:25:50,275
Your bravado ends there.

1037
01:25:52,570 --> 01:25:54,858
Now, shall we die together?

1038
01:25:55,530 --> 01:25:58,282
And go to the place where
Sasuke is waiting?

1039
01:26:20,060 --> 01:26:21,060
Naruto!

1040
01:26:22,361 --> 01:26:23,260
Sakura!

1041
01:26:24,762 --> 01:26:26,604
- Sasame?!
- Sakura...

1042
01:26:27,395 --> 01:26:29,684
Stick this tag on a kunai knife!

1043
01:26:46,344 --> 01:26:46,999
Naruto!

1044
01:26:50,411 --> 01:26:51,296
Naruto!

1045
01:26:52,497 --> 01:26:57,292
Naruto?!
Hey, are you okay? Naruto!

1046
01:26:58,434 --> 01:26:59,196
No way...

1047
01:27:00,575 --> 01:27:01,297
It can't be...

1048
01:27:02,616 --> 01:27:03,616
No way!

1049
01:27:05,511 --> 01:27:07,096
Naruto!

1050
01:27:20,599 --> 01:27:25,490
Ahh...My chest right now
is beating with joy.

1051
01:27:27,761 --> 01:27:30,998
Idiot! It was a waste for me
to have worried!

1052
01:27:31,996 --> 01:27:33,403
Sorry, Sakura...

1053
01:27:33,776 --> 01:27:35,486
You're so worthless!

1054
01:27:39,612 --> 01:27:42,198
That's right, Sasame!
Why are you here?

1055
01:27:42,545 --> 01:27:44,467
Well, it's...

1056
01:27:44,901 --> 01:27:47,945
I was saved by Sasame,
you know.

1057
01:27:48,526 --> 01:27:49,526
Me too.

1058
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:51,707
What do you mean?

1059
01:27:53,265 --> 01:27:56,560
Water came rushing into that
trap pit we were in earlier...

1060
01:28:10,576 --> 01:28:12,996
<i>That's it! The lid to the pit!</i>

1061
01:28:18,485 --> 01:28:19,299
<i>Damn!</i>

1062
01:28:28,501 --> 01:28:30,375
When the water reached
the ceiling,

1063
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:34,404
I desperately tried to open the lid,
but wasn't able to escape...

1064
01:28:39,469 --> 01:28:43,098
I was told by Master Jiraiya
to go to where Hanzaki is.

1065
01:28:45,653 --> 01:28:48,740
But I got concerned about Arashi,
so I came...

1066
01:29:00,153 --> 01:29:01,086
Naruto!

1067
01:29:03,541 --> 01:29:05,511
Hey! Thanks!

1068
01:29:06,396 --> 01:29:07,811
Th-The frog spoke...!

1069
01:29:11,509 --> 01:29:13,389
Well, come to think of it,

1070
01:29:13,414 --> 01:29:16,807
there's no way you could open the lid
of the trap by pushing on it.

1071
01:29:17,353 --> 01:29:18,017
Geez!

1072
01:29:19,662 --> 01:29:21,893
But how come the thread that
I couldn't cut before,

1073
01:29:22,523 --> 01:29:25,211
was cut when I wrapped it
with Sasame's tag?

1074
01:29:28,364 --> 01:29:30,204
That's because those
chakra threads

1075
01:29:30,229 --> 01:29:33,111
are a secret technique
of the Fuma Clan...

1076
01:29:34,327 --> 01:29:35,200
The Fuma?!

1077
01:29:35,309 --> 01:29:38,938
I see...
So who the heck is this?!

1078
01:29:41,876 --> 01:29:42,398
Oh!

1079
01:29:55,001 --> 01:29:57,297
She's...from earlier!

1080
01:30:00,802 --> 01:30:01,844
Mistress Kagero...

1081
01:30:03,903 --> 01:30:05,403
She's a Fuma jonin.

1082
01:30:06,060 --> 01:30:07,110
Sasame!

1083
01:30:09,946 --> 01:30:10,947
Sasame...

1084
01:30:12,115 --> 01:30:16,994
I was resurrected
by Lord Orochimaru...

1085
01:30:17,599 --> 01:30:20,456
You! You're being tricked
by Orochimaru!

1086
01:30:20,748 --> 01:30:22,111
Where is Sasuke?

1087
01:30:22,374 --> 01:30:26,303
And Arashi?
Where's Sasame's cousin!

1088
01:30:27,952 --> 01:30:30,306
Lord Orochimaru is...

1089
01:30:31,650 --> 01:30:35,003
going to raise our Fuma clan...

1090
01:30:36,357 --> 01:30:38,096
to the center stage
of shinobi again.

1091
01:30:39,702 --> 01:30:41,519
You're still talking about
that stuff?!

1092
01:30:42,316 --> 01:30:44,805
At least tell Sasame the truth!

1093
01:30:55,880 --> 01:30:58,104
So...He's in there!

1094
01:31:02,582 --> 01:31:07,837
Sasame and Arashi...
You two were so close...

1095
01:31:12,292 --> 01:31:14,886
It'd be better
if you didn't see him.

1096
01:31:39,770 --> 01:31:40,855
Mistress Kagero...

1097
01:31:45,454 --> 01:31:47,606
What do you want to do, Sasame?

1098
01:31:48,343 --> 01:31:50,110
Do you want to wait here?

1099
01:31:55,899 --> 01:31:59,414
I will see him!
No matter what's in store for me!

1100
01:32:00,369 --> 01:32:02,896
I came all the way here
to see Arashi!

1101
01:32:03,684 --> 01:32:06,110
Yeah! You've got guts!

1102
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:08,910
All right! Let's go together!

1103
01:32:09,368 --> 01:32:10,300
Yeah! Let's go!

1104
01:32:19,665 --> 01:32:20,791
Sasame...

1105
01:32:26,214 --> 01:32:28,401
There might be some sort of trap...

1106
01:32:29,153 --> 01:32:30,703
Leave it to me!

1107
01:32:44,076 --> 01:32:45,076
Orochimaru?!

1108
01:32:51,161 --> 01:32:53,208
Good of you to come, Sasame...

1109
01:32:54,923 --> 01:32:55,805
Why...?

1110
01:33:07,777 --> 01:33:08,945
Arashi...!

1111
01:33:10,978 --> 01:33:12,104
Arashi!

1112
01:33:14,839 --> 01:33:15,709
Arashi?

1113
01:33:18,564 --> 01:33:19,696
I'm no longer...

1114
01:33:21,819 --> 01:33:23,303
Arashi...

1115
01:33:44,869 --> 01:33:47,300
Wh-What the heck is going on?!

1116
01:33:51,208 --> 01:33:54,889
The skills and bodies of the Fuma jonin
were combined into one...

1117
01:33:55,803 --> 01:33:59,101
and I've been reborn as
the ultimate ninja you see...

1118
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:08,587
Now, I'll show you
my ultimate ninjutsu...Sasame!

1119
01:34:09,853 --> 01:34:12,800
No...Arashi...

1120
01:34:14,004 --> 01:34:16,111
Damn, Orochimaru!

1121
01:34:16,753 --> 01:34:20,006
Where's Sasuke!
Where did you put him?!

1122
01:34:21,100 --> 01:34:23,616
Heh! You're Naruto, right?

1123
01:34:25,534 --> 01:34:28,996
You wouldn't believe anything
I said anyway, would you...?

1124
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:32,601
That's right! I won't believe
that Sasuke's dead!

1125
01:34:33,409 --> 01:34:34,202
Naruto...

1126
01:34:37,125 --> 01:34:39,632
That's right. Sasuke is alive.

1127
01:34:40,916 --> 01:34:42,760
I'll bring Sasuke back!

1128
01:34:43,605 --> 01:34:46,005
I made that promise!

1129
01:34:46,575 --> 01:34:47,199
Naruto...

1130
01:34:49,310 --> 01:34:51,394
In that case, take me down!

1131
01:34:52,297 --> 01:34:54,501
If I were the wimp I was in the past,

1132
01:34:54,799 --> 01:34:57,084
I would probably have
told you the truth.

1133
01:34:57,401 --> 01:34:58,306
Arashi!

1134
01:34:58,617 --> 01:35:02,209
No! The old Arashi is dead!

1135
01:35:02,979 --> 01:35:05,651
The person you see here
is just a block of flesh

1136
01:35:05,676 --> 01:35:09,217
kept alive by
Ninja Art: Cadaver Puppets!

1137
01:35:21,155 --> 01:35:24,595
Sakura, please look after Sasame!

1138
01:35:24,914 --> 01:35:26,762
Stop it, Naruto!
Don't fight with Arashi!

1139
01:35:26,912 --> 01:35:27,705
No!

1140
01:35:28,539 --> 01:35:33,044
This guy isn't the same gentle Arashi
you once knew, Sasame!

1141
01:35:33,712 --> 01:35:35,714
Jigumo! Go!

1142
01:35:42,812 --> 01:35:43,708
No!

1143
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:46,012
Sasame! I'm sorry!

1144
01:35:48,190 --> 01:35:49,501
Over here!

1145
01:36:02,804 --> 01:36:03,393
Naruto!

1146
01:36:04,151 --> 01:36:05,201
Don't, Sakura!

1147
01:36:10,777 --> 01:36:12,224
Kamikiri...!

1148
01:36:15,306 --> 01:36:17,271
Finish him!

1149
01:36:22,806 --> 01:36:23,618
Naruto!

1150
01:36:35,602 --> 01:36:38,834
You're...next...!

1151
01:36:42,163 --> 01:36:43,105
Sakura!

1152
01:36:56,550 --> 01:36:58,105
That was close...

1153
01:37:00,354 --> 01:37:03,150
I almost let my guard down.

1154
01:37:04,235 --> 01:37:07,401
Just when you had a chance
to launch a sneak attack.

1155
01:37:07,699 --> 01:37:10,950
You blew it, didn't you, Naruto?

1156
01:37:11,205 --> 01:37:12,034
Naruto!

1157
01:37:12,687 --> 01:37:15,412
All because of that ball and chain...!

1158
01:37:17,444 --> 01:37:18,788
Ball and chain?!

1159
01:37:20,906 --> 01:37:22,795
Naruto...I'm sorry!

1160
01:37:23,082 --> 01:37:25,303
That's not true at all!

1161
01:37:28,717 --> 01:37:30,409
This kind of injury...

1162
01:37:31,071 --> 01:37:33,305
is nothing...at all!

1163
01:37:34,955 --> 01:37:36,308
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

1164
01:37:37,402 --> 01:37:38,703
If there's three on your side...

1165
01:37:39,015 --> 01:37:40,504
I'll go with five on mine!

1166
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:57,311
Kamikiri!

1167
01:38:13,339 --> 01:38:13,908
Naruto!

1168
01:38:20,799 --> 01:38:21,624
Are you all right?!

1169
01:38:25,505 --> 01:38:27,026
You're badly hurt...

1170
01:38:27,353 --> 01:38:31,155
Sakura...This injury is nothing!

1171
01:38:31,409 --> 01:38:36,330
"Sakura...This injury is nothing!"

1172
01:38:42,823 --> 01:38:45,096
Stop it! If you say more than that...!

1173
01:38:45,344 --> 01:38:49,973
I won't say more!
I'll bring this to an end.

1174
01:38:52,024 --> 01:38:53,908
Kamikiri! Jigumo!

1175
01:38:54,644 --> 01:38:57,473
Give me your chakra...

1176
01:39:03,701 --> 01:39:08,957
<i>Boar, Dog, Rat,
Rat, Snake, Rooster, Dog,</i>

1177
01:39:08,982 --> 01:39:15,447
<i>Dog, Monkey, Dragon,
Boar, Boar, Rat, Boar, Dragon...</i>

1178
01:39:16,793 --> 01:39:19,703
Why does Arashi know that technique?

1179
01:39:21,041 --> 01:39:24,893
It's a Hidden Jutsu that only the past
chiefs of the Fuma clan could use...

1180
01:39:25,484 --> 01:39:26,585
What was that?!

1181
01:39:28,994 --> 01:39:30,255
<i>Fuma Ninja Art:</i>

1182
01:39:30,899 --> 01:39:32,424
<i>Spell of the Mandala!</i>

1183
01:39:33,932 --> 01:39:34,600
<i>This ain't good!</i>

1184
01:39:40,733 --> 01:39:41,400
Naruto!

1185
01:39:43,780 --> 01:39:45,396
What the heck is this?!

1186
01:39:46,491 --> 01:39:47,481
This is the end!

1187
01:39:54,003 --> 01:39:54,863
What?!

1188
01:39:58,368 --> 01:39:59,013
Naruto!

1189
01:40:00,228 --> 01:40:03,539
The chakra cage gradually shrinks...

1190
01:40:04,341 --> 01:40:08,886
And the human enclosed therein
is crushed to the size of a tiny nugget.

1191
01:40:09,785 --> 01:40:11,993
You can't break it.

1192
01:40:12,708 --> 01:40:17,219
As long as I myself do not
dissolve the jutsu.

1193
01:40:22,057 --> 01:40:22,907
Naruto!

1194
01:40:36,774 --> 01:40:37,797
<i>I'm incapable of doing anything...</i>

1195
01:40:39,746 --> 01:40:41,907
<i>There's nothing I'm capable of doing...</i>

1196
01:40:47,334 --> 01:40:48,611
<i>The person I am now isn't...</i>

1197
01:40:49,754 --> 01:40:50,697
<i>capable of doing anything!</i>

1198
01:40:54,456 --> 01:40:56,550
Arashi!

1199
01:41:08,543 --> 01:41:09,602
Sasame...

1200
01:41:10,902 --> 01:41:11,900
You!

1201
01:41:13,032 --> 01:41:13,906
Sasame!

1202
01:41:15,261 --> 01:41:18,113
Please...come to your senses...

1203
01:41:19,911 --> 01:41:22,284
Become the old Arashi again!

1204
01:41:23,696 --> 01:41:25,120
I told you, already!

1205
01:41:25,704 --> 01:41:28,149
The old Arashi is dead.

1206
01:41:44,933 --> 01:41:45,974
Arashi...

1207
01:41:47,231 --> 01:41:48,977
I'm sorry, Sasame...

1208
01:41:51,741 --> 01:41:53,649
I wanted power...

1209
01:41:55,007 --> 01:41:58,499
I wanted the Fuma Clan to find
a place in the sun once again...

1210
01:41:59,356 --> 01:42:02,908
Yes! I understand that!
I understand that!

1211
01:42:04,445 --> 01:42:08,708
But, enough now...
Let's go home.

1212
01:42:10,012 --> 01:42:11,204
Let's go back to the village.

1213
01:42:12,029 --> 01:42:15,587
But, I'm just a mere monster now...

1214
01:42:16,506 --> 01:42:17,708
That's not true!

1215
01:42:18,643 --> 01:42:20,148
This is agony...

1216
01:42:21,401 --> 01:42:22,401
Sasame...

1217
01:42:24,279 --> 01:42:26,865
Please...kill me...

1218
01:42:28,645 --> 01:42:30,101
Please...

1219
01:42:33,501 --> 01:42:37,039
How dare you try to kill me!

1220
01:42:37,646 --> 01:42:38,902
Arashi!

1221
01:42:39,489 --> 01:42:42,915
You'll...die!

1222
01:42:48,171 --> 01:42:49,078
Sakura!

1223
01:42:49,343 --> 01:42:51,154
Sakura?

1224
01:42:52,274 --> 01:42:54,819
You wanna be...the first to die?

1225
01:42:57,566 --> 01:42:59,207
Sasame taught me that...

1226
01:43:00,250 --> 01:43:01,636
dying isn't anything to be scared of!

1227
01:43:02,541 --> 01:43:03,300
I see...

1228
01:43:08,032 --> 01:43:11,280
But what's scary is to live one's life
without having been able to do anything...

1229
01:43:12,001 --> 01:43:15,689
I'm not afraid to die in the service
of someone who is important to me!

1230
01:43:16,467 --> 01:43:17,209
Don't!

1231
01:43:19,897 --> 01:43:21,603
I'm telling you...

1232
01:43:22,118 --> 01:43:25,365
Whatever happens, you mustn't die...
No matter what! Sakura!

1233
01:43:26,445 --> 01:43:27,311
Naruto!

1234
01:43:28,434 --> 01:43:29,398
Give it up!

1235
01:43:29,807 --> 01:43:32,505
What is it you think you're capable
of doing the way you are now?!

1236
01:43:39,897 --> 01:43:41,805
You're so useless!

1237
01:43:46,388 --> 01:43:49,598
Vanish from this world!
Get crushed into nothing!

1238
01:43:50,087 --> 01:43:50,849
Sasame!

1239
01:43:51,094 --> 01:43:53,573
Stop that, Arashi!

1240
01:43:54,401 --> 01:43:56,021
Sasame...you!

1241
01:44:09,674 --> 01:44:10,289
Naruto!

1242
01:44:10,835 --> 01:44:12,120
Hey! Let go!

1243
01:44:12,813 --> 01:44:13,498
No!

1244
01:44:48,344 --> 01:44:49,429
Arashi?!

1245
01:44:50,452 --> 01:44:51,868
I'm sorry, Sasame...

1246
01:44:53,281 --> 01:44:55,309
I caused you so much hardship...

1247
01:44:55,859 --> 01:44:56,907
No, you haven't!

1248
01:44:58,108 --> 01:45:01,311
The person who experienced
the greatest hardship is you, Arashi!

1249
01:45:02,704 --> 01:45:05,757
Is there anything I can do for you?

1250
01:45:06,707 --> 01:45:08,099
What should I do for you?!

1251
01:45:08,959 --> 01:45:11,199
You've already helped me
more than enough...

1252
01:45:11,833 --> 01:45:14,324
See...Thanks to you, Sasame,

1253
01:45:14,349 --> 01:45:16,802
I was able to return to being
the person I was in the past...

1254
01:45:23,064 --> 01:45:23,664
Naruto!

1255
01:45:26,650 --> 01:45:27,654
Sakura...

1256
01:45:29,181 --> 01:45:31,568
Even if it's to be of service
to someone...

1257
01:45:32,268 --> 01:45:35,483
There's no life that
should be lost for that!

1258
01:45:38,315 --> 01:45:38,846
Yeah!

1259
01:45:42,321 --> 01:45:43,421
Run! Sakura!

1260
01:45:51,882 --> 01:45:52,971
Pervy Sage!

1261
01:45:53,282 --> 01:45:55,389
Sorry to be late!

1262
01:45:55,930 --> 01:45:58,560
I was faced with a number of obstacles
on my end too!

1263
01:45:59,679 --> 01:46:00,896
Gimme a break...

1264
01:46:01,001 --> 01:46:02,502
Now then...
Climb on, climb on!

1265
01:46:04,375 --> 01:46:06,651
Hurry! Let's get back above ground!

1266
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:15,997
Oops!

1267
01:46:16,605 --> 01:46:17,493
Sasame!

1268
01:46:18,397 --> 01:46:21,625
She's fine...She just fainted.

1269
01:46:24,993 --> 01:46:25,699
Naruto!

1270
01:46:27,676 --> 01:46:32,302
Orochimaru assigned us a mission...

1271
01:46:33,684 --> 01:46:35,456
We were to make sure
nobody took Sasuke back

1272
01:46:35,481 --> 01:46:37,202
to the Hidden Leaf
under any circumstances!

1273
01:46:38,466 --> 01:46:39,935
Then, Sasuke is...?!

1274
01:46:41,043 --> 01:46:42,771
Yeah...He's alive!

1275
01:46:43,724 --> 01:46:45,221
Orochimaru had to protect Sasuke

1276
01:46:45,246 --> 01:46:50,589
because he is his vital vessel which
he will possess in three years!

1277
01:46:52,869 --> 01:46:55,659
Arashi...

1278
01:46:56,971 --> 01:46:59,283
Arashi...This place is gonna collapse!

1279
01:46:59,308 --> 01:47:00,428
Hurry up and come over here!

1280
01:47:09,456 --> 01:47:11,205
I'm already just a puppet...

1281
01:47:11,926 --> 01:47:13,969
I cannot live my life anywhere
except here.

1282
01:47:15,056 --> 01:47:16,054
Arashi...

1283
01:47:20,844 --> 01:47:21,495
All right!

1284
01:47:21,726 --> 01:47:25,063
No! Arashi!

1285
01:47:28,805 --> 01:47:29,733
Sasame...

1286
01:47:32,636 --> 01:47:33,655
Thank you.

1287
01:47:52,422 --> 01:47:56,011
Including Arashi,
we've paid an extraordinary price but...

1288
01:47:56,702 --> 01:47:58,847
The Fuma Clan has been
able to cut itself free

1289
01:47:58,872 --> 01:48:00,707
from Orochimaru's spell...

1290
01:48:01,405 --> 01:48:03,727
You can start again anew.

1291
01:48:04,598 --> 01:48:06,980
I will rebuild the
Clan again without fail!

1292
01:48:08,250 --> 01:48:12,444
With this life...
that Arashi protected.

1293
01:48:17,054 --> 01:48:17,802
Yeah!

1294
01:48:19,901 --> 01:48:22,370
I am truly indebted to you.

1295
01:48:23,254 --> 01:48:24,206
Sasame...

1296
01:48:27,359 --> 01:48:29,211
Hanzaki, I'm leaving these two
in your hands!

1297
01:48:29,866 --> 01:48:32,631
Yes, sir!
Please take care along the road!

1298
01:48:33,155 --> 01:48:34,048
I will.

1299
01:48:35,783 --> 01:48:37,924
- Thank you!
- We thank you!

1300
01:48:38,263 --> 01:48:39,678
- Take care!
- See you again!

1301
01:48:39,703 --> 01:48:41,811
Hey! Hang in there!

1302
01:48:46,990 --> 01:48:50,148
Well, we weren't able
to find Sasuke,

1303
01:48:50,416 --> 01:48:52,734
but at least we now know
that he's alive somewhere...

1304
01:48:53,587 --> 01:48:56,026
We'll have to settle for the fact
that we were able to ascertain

1305
01:48:56,051 --> 01:48:59,276
the new information that we still have
a grace period of three years

1306
01:48:59,301 --> 01:49:02,262
before he becomes a vessel
to be possessed by Orochimaru.

1307
01:49:03,802 --> 01:49:04,413
Yes...

1308
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:09,751
<i>Sasame knew what she needed
to do for her clan...</i>

1309
01:49:10,642 --> 01:49:13,337
<i>But this time again all I did was cry.</i>

1310
01:49:14,589 --> 01:49:16,925
<i>All I did was depend on Naruto...</i>

1311
01:49:17,259 --> 01:49:18,110
Sakura!

1312
01:49:19,794 --> 01:49:21,596
You gave your best effort too!

1313
01:49:22,998 --> 01:49:26,601
No, I was just a ball and chain
to everyone...

1314
01:49:27,704 --> 01:49:29,282
I wasn't capable of doing
anything alone...

1315
01:49:29,731 --> 01:49:31,439
That's not true!

1316
01:49:33,053 --> 01:49:37,604
Seeing you give your best effort
gave me a lot of courage, Sakura.

1317
01:49:40,548 --> 01:49:43,910
If you hadn't been there, Sakura,
I'd have been crushed just like that.

1318
01:49:45,073 --> 01:49:47,104
It's thanks to you, Sakura!

1319
01:49:48,490 --> 01:49:49,401
Naruto...

1320
01:49:50,935 --> 01:49:54,652
Wow, you've grown into someone
who can say that sort of thing!

1321
01:49:54,677 --> 01:50:01,291
Oww! I'm an injured man!
Treat me with a little more care!

1322
01:50:01,498 --> 01:50:03,054
Oh yeah, that's right!

1323
01:50:09,668 --> 01:50:11,898
<i>What I'm capable of
doing right now...</i>

1324
01:50:18,835 --> 01:50:20,030
I was thinking...

1325
01:50:20,294 --> 01:50:21,006
What?

1326
01:50:22,581 --> 01:50:25,402
There are many variables such
as mission level,

1327
01:50:26,362 --> 01:50:28,602
or platoon's member structure...

1328
01:50:29,409 --> 01:50:31,445
But no matter how small
a platoon might be,

1329
01:50:31,470 --> 01:50:34,836
I think it's important to assign
one Medical Ninja to it...

1330
01:50:35,473 --> 01:50:37,047
I know that already...

1331
01:50:37,869 --> 01:50:40,486
I wrote exactly the same thing
in a report long ago

1332
01:50:40,511 --> 01:50:43,428
regarding the survival rate and mission
achievement rate of small platoons.

1333
01:50:44,453 --> 01:50:47,432
But it's not that easy to
nurture Medical Ninja.

1334
01:50:51,003 --> 01:50:53,511
They require a different set of skills
than that of fighting ninja...

1335
01:50:54,407 --> 01:50:57,192
The minute perfection
of chakra control,

1336
01:50:58,006 --> 01:51:00,474
the ability to assimilate a huge volume
of specialized knowledge,

1337
01:51:00,499 --> 01:51:03,698
the brains to apply that in a broad way...
patience...

1338
01:51:04,727 --> 01:51:05,707
And the most important thing

1339
01:51:05,732 --> 01:51:09,503
for shinobi who are to develop
into a Medical Ninja...

1340
01:51:12,440 --> 01:51:15,313
Well, I'm busy right now, so...

1341
01:51:18,201 --> 01:51:21,007
The most important thing...huh?

1342
01:51:22,419 --> 01:51:25,664
I'm all wrapped up in bandages again...

1343
01:51:26,304 --> 01:51:28,890
This way I can't even
hold chopsticks...

1344
01:51:29,353 --> 01:51:34,182
Sakura, when it's time for
my meal, feed me, okay?

1345
01:51:34,459 --> 01:51:35,950
I'll open up my mouth
just like this and...

1346
01:51:36,904 --> 01:51:38,733
Huh? Sakura?

1347
01:51:43,302 --> 01:51:45,907
I'm sorry! I was just joking!

1348
01:51:46,585 --> 01:51:47,909
I'm sorry...Naruto...

1349
01:51:48,758 --> 01:51:49,313
Huh?

1350
01:51:53,413 --> 01:51:56,213
This is gonna mean that
I'll keep you waiting a little but...

1351
01:51:59,133 --> 01:52:00,396
Next time, I definitely won't...

1352
01:52:02,668 --> 01:52:04,426
be a ball and chain to you!

1353
01:52:10,909 --> 01:52:11,496
Huh?

1354
01:52:15,229 --> 01:52:16,104
Enter!

1355
01:52:22,609 --> 01:52:23,894
I came here with a request!

1356
01:52:24,955 --> 01:52:25,779
What is it?

1357
01:52:27,084 --> 01:52:29,242
Please make me your apprentice!

1358
01:52:50,286 --> 01:52:53,183
<i>You're very desperate, aren't you?</i>

1359
01:52:54,704 --> 01:52:55,894
Sakura Haruno,

1360
01:52:56,309 --> 01:52:59,610
I heard from Kakashi that you have
a brilliant mind as well as will power!

1361
01:53:03,813 --> 01:53:04,511
All right.

1362
01:53:07,402 --> 01:53:09,324
But in exchange,
I'm not gonna be easy on you!

1363
01:53:10,056 --> 01:53:10,717
Yes, ma'am!

1364
01:53:16,788 --> 01:53:18,249
<i>This recent mission...</i>

1365
01:53:20,104 --> 01:53:23,274
<i>looks like it wasn't wasted
on her, after all.</i>
