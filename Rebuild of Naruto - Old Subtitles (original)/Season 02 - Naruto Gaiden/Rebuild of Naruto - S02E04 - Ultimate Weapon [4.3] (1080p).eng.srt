1
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:37,639
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

2
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,652
Oh, long time no see.

3
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,154
We don't have much time
to get nostalgic.

4
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:54,863
We've got a mission.

5
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,830
That's the
Village of Artisans, isn't it?

6
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:05,500
Yeah. It's a village of professionals
who develop ninja tools.

7
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,378
The exceptional ninja tools
they develop are also

8
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,425
supplied to us
in the Five Great Nations...

9
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,676
But there's been
a strange rumor recently.

10
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,678
A strange rumor?

11
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:19,575
Something about them developing
an ultimate weapon

12
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,478
and attempting to antagonize
the Five Great Nations.

13
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,232
In other words, we should
search the village and

14
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:30,692
verify whether or not
there is such a weapon, right?

15
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,229
That's about the size of it.

16
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,028
Piece of cake.

17
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:04,058
Hey! Something strange is going on.

18
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:05,767
What is it?!

19
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,271
There's not a soul in the village!

20
00:03:08,698 --> 00:03:11,075
I also found something terrible
on top of that.

21
00:03:11,465 --> 00:03:12,180
What?!

22
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,616
It's that.

23
00:03:21,174 --> 00:03:24,678
The coffin of Seimei, the founder of
the Village of Artisans.

24
00:03:25,116 --> 00:03:26,200
Even his body is...

25
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,456
This is serious.

26
00:03:30,372 --> 00:03:34,501
The artisans abandoned their village.
Where in the world did they go?

27
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,604
I'm hungry, I'm hungry!

28
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:55,109
Maybe I'll treat myself and have
two eggs in my ramen today.

29
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,656
Huh?

30
00:04:06,703 --> 00:04:07,703
What's going on there?!

31
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,124
Did I keep you waiting by any chance?

32
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,961
Not really. I just got here.

33
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:16,297
That's good...Then, here.

34
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,360
I made sure to hand deliver it to you.

35
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:22,356
Yeah, yeah. What a pain.

36
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,639
Just a minute!

37
00:04:25,575 --> 00:04:27,910
What're you guys doing...

38
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,620
all in secret in a place like this
without even asking me?!

39
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,188
- Naruto?
- Huh?

40
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,983
You're terrible, just terrible, Sakura!

41
00:04:35,195 --> 00:04:37,642
Here you won't even go out
on a date with me at all!

42
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,822
Why're you talking gibberish
all of a sudden?

43
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,658
Ouch ouch ouch ouch...

44
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:47,041
An errand for the Old Lady?

45
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,932
Yes. It seems a new poison
was discovered or something.

46
00:04:51,186 --> 00:04:53,685
I delivered a list of
research medicinal substance

47
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,169
for Shikamaru's father to prepare.

48
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:56,838
Oh, that's it?!

49
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,673
Jeez, you jump to conclusions.

50
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:01,843
Oh, come to think of it,

51
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:06,014
an update report from Temari
has been delivered to Lady Tsunade.

52
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:07,849
An update report?

53
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:09,434
So? What exactly?

54
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:14,570
I heard that the Hidden Sand Village
started ninja education,

55
00:05:14,595 --> 00:05:16,791
imitating the curriculum program
of the Leaf's.

56
00:05:17,304 --> 00:05:20,516
It seems that Temari and her brothers
are working as instructors.

57
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:21,863
Instructors?!

58
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:25,700
Is that harsh woman fit to be
something like an instructor...?

59
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,870
Really? Gaara, huh?

60
00:05:39,929 --> 00:05:41,014
This is hands on training.

61
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,711
Choose a ninja tool that suits you
from this selection.

62
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,521
What is it?

63
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:52,560
Do we absolutely have to choose?!

64
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:55,395
What do you mean?

65
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,901
We'll end up hurting each other
if we use a weapon.

66
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,278
We might kill them.

67
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,005
A weapon is...

68
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:19,263
No, never mind...

69
00:06:24,205 --> 00:06:25,539
A mission isn't a game.

70
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,180
If you were to enter a field of battle
with that frame of mind, you'd die.

71
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,099
I-I'm sorry.

72
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,761
You got Gaara angry because
you ask stupid questions.

73
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:35,977
You're in trouble.

74
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:44,238
The three of us will conduct
hands on training.

75
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:46,901
Gather in the respective class
of your choice.

76
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,952
Gaara, put on a smile!

77
00:06:51,518 --> 00:06:54,855
They'll get scared and nobody will
choose you with that sulky look.

78
00:06:56,557 --> 00:07:00,895
My dad said that Gaara
was the Sand's ultimate weapon.

79
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:05,299
Yeah. He's so powerful that the village
would be destroyed if he got mad.

80
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,961
He's scary, so let's not bother.

81
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,054
All right, I'm with Temari.

82
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,514
I'll be with Kankuro!

83
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,975
- Me too!
- Me too!

84
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,726
- Me too!
- Me too!

85
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:17,979
Please be my teacher.

86
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:28,156
<i>Earlier, he was trying to
teach me something...</i>

87
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,039
Excuse me...Please be my teacher.

88
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,227
Are you okay with me?

89
00:07:42,135 --> 00:07:43,135
Please teach me!

90
00:07:48,317 --> 00:07:49,818
This is cool.

91
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,262
That's too big!

92
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,097
I'll take this.

93
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,032
What's your name?

94
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,783
I'm Matsuri.

95
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,286
Matsuri, choose a weapon.

96
00:08:39,293 --> 00:08:40,294
What's the matter?

97
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:50,071
Come at me with that weapon
with the intent to kill me.

98
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,405
Yes, sir...

99
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:58,788
They say an ogre with an iron club
is invincible. But you are no ogre.

100
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:02,583
Yes, sir. Please tell me
what I should choose.

101
00:09:10,107 --> 00:09:11,692
The weapon called the rope javelin.

102
00:09:12,325 --> 00:09:13,410
Rope javelin...

103
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,686
The sharp blade on the end of the rope

104
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:26,107
is to keep an enemy out of one's reach,
rather than for attack.

105
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:29,777
And you seal off an enemy's movement
with the rope.

106
00:09:33,822 --> 00:09:37,159
Practice until you can control it
as a part of your body.

107
00:09:37,725 --> 00:09:38,726
Yes, sir!

108
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,816
Damn. Who are you guys?!

109
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:18,159
Is this all
the Sand Village shinobi can do?

110
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:19,993
Wait.

111
00:10:20,444 --> 00:10:24,364
Leave this guy alive.
We can use him to draw that one out.

112
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:35,009
Hang in there! What is it?!
What happened?

113
00:10:35,476 --> 00:10:38,645
Take me to Gaara...Quickly.

114
00:11:10,277 --> 00:11:11,277
What's the matter?

115
00:11:11,628 --> 00:11:16,133
My mother and father were hit with
countless weapons right in front of me.

116
00:11:16,975 --> 00:11:18,143
So I...

117
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,474
For what purpose
do you hold a weapon?

118
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,435
He...

119
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,563
<i>What are...</i>

120
00:11:31,848 --> 00:11:33,934
<i>...these two to you?!</i>

121
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,047
<i>Th-These guys are...</i>

122
00:11:39,072 --> 00:11:40,949
<i>...my friends!</i>

123
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:44,078
<i>Try laying so much as
another finger on them!</i>

124
00:11:44,586 --> 00:11:46,671
<i>I'll clobber you!</i>

125
00:11:46,955 --> 00:11:49,624
He said that to me.

126
00:11:58,033 --> 00:12:00,577
That's what we're after: Gaara.

127
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:10,146
Gaara, we were
just coming to get you.

128
00:12:10,912 --> 00:12:13,415
The patrol ninja were
attacked by somebody.

129
00:12:13,741 --> 00:12:16,393
Guys calling themselves
the Four Celestials,

130
00:12:16,418 --> 00:12:21,006
brandishing strange weapons,
said to tell Gaara that...

131
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,920
"We declare a challenger to you,
the ultimate weapon.

132
00:12:28,264 --> 00:12:30,099
If you don't accept the challenge,

133
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:35,328
we will take one person
close to you every day...

134
00:12:35,353 --> 00:12:37,606
and they shall
pay the price for you."

135
00:12:46,781 --> 00:12:47,781
You there.

136
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,926
Are you Gaara's student?

137
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,891
You shall be the first sacrifice.

138
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,495
What's this rope javelin?!

139
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:08,662
Wait!

140
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,543
The enemy went northeast...

141
00:13:14,818 --> 00:13:16,778
Matsuri has become the first sacrifice...

142
00:13:17,103 --> 00:13:20,773
But the real target of that group is...

143
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:22,183
you, Gaara.

144
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:23,676
Yeah...

145
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,888
This must be brought to
a jonin council at once...

146
00:13:35,438 --> 00:13:37,333
The Four Celestials left

147
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:40,194
towards the northeast.

148
00:13:40,368 --> 00:13:42,621
The Hidden Leaf Village
is in that direction,

149
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,376
with the Land of Rivers
sandwiched between.

150
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:48,209
Therefore, we will be requesting
the assistance of the Leaf...

151
00:13:50,053 --> 00:13:52,055
Temari, Kankuro, Gaara.

152
00:13:52,556 --> 00:13:55,309
Form a unit and prepare for
pursuit immediately.

153
00:13:57,278 --> 00:13:58,278
Hold it.

154
00:13:58,662 --> 00:14:00,330
The enemy is after Gaara.

155
00:14:00,781 --> 00:14:03,784
We might be walking
right into a trap.

156
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:06,962
That's right.
Why won't you send a party?!

157
00:14:08,838 --> 00:14:11,007
It might be a diversionary tactic
by the enemy.

158
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,585
The village will become shorthanded
if we send out pursuers.

159
00:14:14,152 --> 00:14:17,489
Then you at least could
come with us, right, Baki?!

160
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,093
Hey, how about it?!

161
00:14:22,752 --> 00:14:25,880
I've been given
a different mission, you see...

162
00:14:26,506 --> 00:14:29,133
Go. She's your student, right?

163
00:14:33,897 --> 00:14:35,482
Let's go, Kankuro.

164
00:14:48,987 --> 00:14:50,364
Will it be okay with her?!

165
00:14:50,914 --> 00:14:52,248
She's just a kid.

166
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,893
Will he come?!

167
00:14:55,269 --> 00:15:00,608
If he doesn't come, we'll just sacrifice
those close to him one after another.

168
00:15:05,061 --> 00:15:06,062
That is...?

169
00:15:14,922 --> 00:15:16,590
It's a message from the Sand Village!

170
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,710
Gaara? Why?

171
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,505
Who knows?
The goal is a challenge to Gaara.

172
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,342
The hostage is a
ninja school student.

173
00:15:27,492 --> 00:15:30,787
The enemy is escaping in the direction of
the Land of Fire from the Land of Rivers.

174
00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:35,342
Gaara, Temari and Kankuro are
chasing after them.

175
00:15:36,184 --> 00:15:38,270
At this point, that's all we know.

176
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:42,207
You want me to set up an operation
to stop the overconfident jerks

177
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:45,235
who challenged Gaara
just with that information?

178
00:15:45,894 --> 00:15:49,064
Yeah. We're on friendly terms
with the Sand Village, so.

179
00:15:50,022 --> 00:15:51,566
Just a minute.

180
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:56,546
They came during the Sasuke incident
with much less information than this.

181
00:15:56,846 --> 00:15:58,765
Things are more bothersome
than that time!

182
00:15:59,356 --> 00:16:01,501
Our range would widen significantly
if we ambushed them

183
00:16:01,526 --> 00:16:03,212
instead of pursuing them.

184
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,148
There's also the incident in question
in the Village of Artisans,

185
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,967
and the jonin and chunin
are all away...

186
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:10,260
- Shizune...
- Yes, ma'am!

187
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,682
Those are the only genin
we can use now.

188
00:16:15,532 --> 00:16:17,268
Take the genin you want to use

189
00:16:17,293 --> 00:16:20,104
and leave the village
within thirty minutes!

190
00:16:21,071 --> 00:16:23,407
Sakura's name isn't on here.

191
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,360
Yeah. She's doing
Medical Ninjutsu training now, so.

192
00:16:28,094 --> 00:16:31,907
I'll accept the mission.
But I have one condition.

193
00:16:33,517 --> 00:16:35,143
Please let me borrow Sakura.

194
00:16:36,444 --> 00:16:37,444
Sakura?

195
00:16:45,445 --> 00:16:49,115
It's almost time!
Is this everyone, Shikamaru?!

196
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:50,751
One person still hasn't come.

197
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,886
Could that be...?

198
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,598
Sorry to keep you waiting!

199
00:16:57,357 --> 00:17:01,861
I can't do a mission hungry.
So I stopped by Ichiraku for a bit.

200
00:17:02,038 --> 00:17:04,957
What?! That's not fair just you
getting to eat! I'll also...

201
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:08,777
All right! Now we've got
all our members together! We're off!

202
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:12,255
Huh? What? This is it?!

203
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,575
I'd heard this was an operation
with a mobilization

204
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,096
of the genin
remaining in the village!

205
00:17:16,385 --> 00:17:18,262
That's right, this is everyone!

206
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,989
That's messed up!

207
00:17:20,014 --> 00:17:22,149
Setting aside Sakura, who's training,

208
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:25,177
there should still be
Shino, Neji and Hinata!

209
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:28,605
No mistake. It's weird that
Akamaru and I are the only ninja

210
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,132
with tracking abilities.

211
00:17:30,756 --> 00:17:34,218
So is this team
a go for it super attack type?

212
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:37,823
Yeah. I name us
Team Return the Favor.

213
00:17:39,148 --> 00:17:40,817
What lame naming!

214
00:17:41,468 --> 00:17:46,139
The guys from the Sand Village
helped us during the Sasuke incident!

215
00:17:46,589 --> 00:17:49,550
In a manner, this operation will be
returning the favor from that time!

216
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:54,114
All right! Guys, let's make sure to
return the favor from that time.

217
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,492
You're not the leader!

218
00:17:57,717 --> 00:18:00,345
Shikamaru, the chunin, is the leader
of this platoon, right?!

219
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,663
<i>That's right...</i>

220
00:18:02,189 --> 00:18:06,276
Jeez, then let's settle on a strategy
and get going as soon as possible.

221
00:18:06,576 --> 00:18:09,245
Are we going in one line
as we did for the Sasuke incident?

222
00:18:11,163 --> 00:18:14,123
There's no doubting that the conditions
are similar to the Sasuke incident.

223
00:18:14,268 --> 00:18:17,938
However, the strategies for pursuit
and ambush are completely different!

224
00:18:18,738 --> 00:18:22,367
We can't follow them with Byakugan
or by using Akamaru's nose.

225
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:24,035
No mistake about that.

226
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,969
It's unconventional, but since these are
all the people we've got,

227
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:30,501
we'll act in groups of two basis
as Two Man Cells.

228
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:33,428
Solo action is prohibited
no matter what the case!

229
00:18:34,221 --> 00:18:36,223
We owe a debt to the ninja in
the Sand Village.

230
00:18:36,707 --> 00:18:40,961
However, although this is to repay a debt,
no way will we produce casualties!

231
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,164
Yeah, I got it.

232
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,839
- Follow me, Ino.
- Right!

233
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:53,841
Choji, you go with Kiba...

234
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,260
I'm counting on you, Choji, Akamaru.

235
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,511
Right...

236
00:18:58,679 --> 00:18:59,721
Lee, you're with Naruto...

237
00:19:00,121 --> 00:19:03,333
Right. Please refrain
from selfish actions.

238
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,853
You don't need to tell
me something like that.

239
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:10,482
Also, the four people Naruto mentioned
earlier have left before us.

240
00:19:11,032 --> 00:19:14,953
Four people? Do you mean
Shino, Neji, Hinata and Sakura?

241
00:19:15,296 --> 00:19:17,840
Yeah. Those four will be
going their separate ways

242
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,385
and won't take part in future battles!

243
00:19:19,907 --> 00:19:21,075
Why not?!

244
00:19:21,868 --> 00:19:24,120
Isn't that an incredible waste
of battle strength?!

245
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,708
In place of that, we get a wider range
of search action...

246
00:19:27,957 --> 00:19:32,044
And we'll have them focus on
medical aid if we engage in battle.

247
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:36,550
I have been entrusted with your lives
and this is my strategy!

248
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,421
<i>All right, just wait, Gaara!</i>

249
00:20:15,063 --> 00:20:17,691
<i>I'll make sure to return the favor!</i>

250
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,001
So, Kujaku? What's going on
with our pursuers?

251
00:20:20,777 --> 00:20:24,281
Yeah, we went to the trouble of
leaving footprints as we go.

252
00:20:24,781 --> 00:20:26,574
We need them to follow.

253
00:20:33,381 --> 00:20:36,343
It'll be okay. They'll be within
firing range in no time!

254
00:20:37,018 --> 00:20:39,270
There are three pursuers.
One of them is Gaara!

255
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,549
As for the extra two, we'll leave one
behind

256
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,392
and deal with them with
them one on one...

257
00:20:45,052 --> 00:20:48,222
I'll isolate Gaara and drive him into
the Reverse Scale Position.

258
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,791
I'll take the first person.

259
00:20:51,507 --> 00:20:52,842
All right, go.

260
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:05,381
Hey, Shikamaru.
What's the matter?

261
00:21:06,106 --> 00:21:07,565
We'll stand by here for a while.

262
00:21:07,941 --> 00:21:09,109
Stand by?

263
00:21:09,676 --> 00:21:12,679
We don't have time fooling around
in a place like this!

264
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,623
Be quiet for a second, Naruto.

265
00:21:16,565 --> 00:21:19,860
That's right.
Shikamaru's got a proper plan.

266
00:21:20,036 --> 00:21:24,374
Right, right. Naruto, you have to
be sure to obey the leader.

267
00:21:25,842 --> 00:21:26,926
Fine.

268
00:21:44,044 --> 00:21:45,796
<i>Shino, I'm counting on you.</i>

269
00:21:59,784 --> 00:22:02,871
It's not necessary to drive him
into the Reverse Scale Position.

270
00:22:03,313 --> 00:22:07,317
There are only three of them.
I can handle them by myself.

271
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:12,497
<i>Flying Kujaku Double Edge Sword:</i>

272
00:22:13,239 --> 00:22:14,239
<i>Whirlwind!</i>

273
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,520
What?!

274
00:22:20,588 --> 00:22:21,588
What is this?

275
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,333
A wind user, huh?

276
00:22:25,168 --> 00:22:26,168
Interesting!

277
00:22:44,612 --> 00:22:46,781
- Splendid.
- Not bad, Temari.

278
00:22:46,806 --> 00:22:47,891
Naturally.

279
00:22:48,483 --> 00:22:50,193
Not half bad.

280
00:22:59,219 --> 00:23:01,596
To think you'd blow away my Whirlwind.

281
00:23:02,222 --> 00:23:04,432
What, you're still just a kid?

282
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,154
- You guys go on ahead.
- What?

283
00:23:09,904 --> 00:23:11,573
Hey, Temari. You okay with this?

284
00:23:12,098 --> 00:23:13,098
Will you be okay?

285
00:23:13,357 --> 00:23:16,036
Well, we're fellow wind users.

286
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:18,980
I should be able to handle her alone.

287
00:23:20,147 --> 00:23:21,649
Hurry, Gaara.

288
00:23:22,358 --> 00:23:23,442
She's your student, right?

289
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:25,936
Thanks.

290
00:23:26,313 --> 00:23:28,148
- I'm counting on you.
- Be careful.

291
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:29,491
Right.

292
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:30,675
You won't get away.

293
00:23:31,301 --> 00:23:32,844
I'm your opponent.

294
00:23:33,695 --> 00:23:35,322
<i>Cyclone Scythe Jutsu!</i>

295
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:41,669
<i>Wind Slash!</i>

296
00:23:49,202 --> 00:23:50,202
This wind is...

297
00:23:50,946 --> 00:23:55,358
These double swords alter the wind
at my will to suit the attacks

298
00:23:55,383 --> 00:23:57,426
and amplify the power to the extreme.

299
00:23:58,361 --> 00:23:59,946
It's too late to regret.

300
00:24:00,521 --> 00:24:03,121
I only need a little bit of chakra
as long as I have these swords.

301
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,603
How long can you persevere with
the limited chakra you have?

302
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,030
How about testing that out?

303
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:15,819
<i>Matsuri.</i>

304
00:24:18,906 --> 00:24:19,949
We caught up.

305
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,544
Where are we?

306
00:24:23,244 --> 00:24:24,244
So you're awake?

307
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:29,400
Heh. You're like prey plunged on
a branch by a shrike.

308
00:24:29,425 --> 00:24:31,510
You're the bait to lure him out.

309
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,720
What?

310
00:24:35,747 --> 00:24:36,748
Gaara Sensei.

311
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:44,466
<i>Dragon Eye: Fang Release: Dark Sword.</i>

312
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,321
What?

313
00:24:58,487 --> 00:24:59,487
Damn it.

314
00:25:09,606 --> 00:25:13,193
Did you see that? This is the Dragon Eye:
Fang Release: Dark Sword.

315
00:25:15,296 --> 00:25:18,341
It can look like a living snake
depending on how it's controlled.

316
00:25:19,033 --> 00:25:21,285
But there's no point
once it's been identified.

317
00:25:22,195 --> 00:25:25,907
We both use puppets but,
compared to mine, his is just a kid's toy.

318
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:27,583
Go, Gaara.

319
00:25:27,783 --> 00:25:28,826
Can I leave it to you?

320
00:25:29,143 --> 00:25:33,022
Yeah. I don't need your help for this.
I'll catch up right away.

321
00:25:33,589 --> 00:25:34,589
I'm counting on you.

322
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:38,019
Now, bring it on. I'll play with you.

323
00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:40,379
What're you doing acting tough?

324
00:25:40,763 --> 00:25:43,182
You'll die if you take me lightly!

325
00:25:43,683 --> 00:25:45,476
That goes for you too!

326
00:25:46,303 --> 00:25:48,972
Then die, Kabuki makeup jerk!

327
00:25:50,907 --> 00:25:51,908
Here I go.

328
00:26:10,225 --> 00:26:11,310
That's no good.

329
00:26:11,594 --> 00:26:13,596
Come on, that was too easy.

330
00:26:23,948 --> 00:26:28,077
Too bad. This sword
isn't just an adjustable sword.

331
00:26:28,442 --> 00:26:32,612
The sword itself amplifies chakra
in response to my chakra

332
00:26:32,637 --> 00:26:34,805
and changes into the form of a dragon.

333
00:26:35,917 --> 00:26:39,671
Gaara, I'm sorry.
This might take a little time.

334
00:26:42,157 --> 00:26:45,118
Suiko, you ambush him here.

335
00:26:45,673 --> 00:26:48,092
Draw him into
the Reverse Scale Position. Got it?

336
00:26:48,281 --> 00:26:48,943
Yeah...

337
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:04,973
You won't get through here.

338
00:27:06,043 --> 00:27:07,795
Gaara, fight me.

339
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,801
Very well.

340
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:11,337
Bring it.

341
00:27:23,702 --> 00:27:26,856
Hey, Shikamaru. How long are we
going to stay like this?

342
00:27:26,881 --> 00:27:31,052
Shut up. There are many difficulties
with ambushes.

343
00:27:31,637 --> 00:27:36,434
Right now, Shino, Neji and Hinata
are taking on those difficulties for us.

344
00:27:37,108 --> 00:27:38,276
What? They are?

345
00:27:48,694 --> 00:27:49,694
Did you find them?

346
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,121
<i>Byakugan!</i>

347
00:28:03,234 --> 00:28:04,444
In that direction, right?

348
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:06,309
<i>Byakugan!</i>

349
00:28:20,164 --> 00:28:23,000
Got it. There are three battle areas.

350
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,600
<i>It's the scent bag of
the female Parasitic Insects.</i>

351
00:28:38,129 --> 00:28:41,633
<i>With this, the insects will find you
no matter where you go.</i>

352
00:28:42,575 --> 00:28:44,201
<i>Right. I'm counting on you, Shino.</i>

353
00:28:44,877 --> 00:28:46,379
<i>Then, we'll be going on ahead.</i>

354
00:28:47,108 --> 00:28:48,108
<i>Be careful!</i>

355
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,604
Oh, information has arrived.

356
00:28:52,176 --> 00:28:53,761
I was getting sick of waiting!

357
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:55,705
All right, I'm counting on you guys.

358
00:29:01,913 --> 00:29:04,832
This is bad.
It's already begun.

359
00:29:05,457 --> 00:29:08,054
All right, Kiba and Choji,
you take the western forest.

360
00:29:08,682 --> 00:29:10,362
Ino and I will
take the northeastern hills.

361
00:29:10,828 --> 00:29:13,664
Naruto and Lee, you take
the northwestern forest.

362
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:17,528
We'll take on back up
in two man cells.

363
00:29:18,219 --> 00:29:21,861
Now then, let's begin
the favor-returning operation.

364
00:29:21,886 --> 00:29:22,886
- Right.
- Right.

365
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:26,073
I was waiting for this time!

366
00:29:26,386 --> 00:29:27,386
Scatter.

367
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,171
What is it?

368
00:29:41,525 --> 00:29:42,525
Hold up.

369
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:49,580
<i>If these guys are taking them
on one on one,</i>

370
00:29:49,901 --> 00:29:52,486
<i>and the battle area isn't
a straight line, then...</i>

371
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:55,452
Could it be a barrier?

372
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,900
What?

373
00:29:56,994 --> 00:29:57,994
Just to be safe.

374
00:30:11,664 --> 00:30:13,457
That should do it. Let's go.

375
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:14,686
Right.

376
00:30:33,076 --> 00:30:37,414
Now, there's nowhere left to hide.
What will you do?

377
00:30:38,449 --> 00:30:40,952
<i>To think she'd evade all of my attacks.</i>

378
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,559
<i>Since it's come to this, I've just got to
use that technique!</i>

379
00:30:47,686 --> 00:30:49,974
<i>Wind Style: Sea Dragon!</i>

380
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:58,903
What's that? Nothing's happening.

381
00:30:59,696 --> 00:31:03,157
How pitiful. It seems the wind
doesn't like you.

382
00:31:04,158 --> 00:31:05,243
I don't know about that.

383
00:31:11,499 --> 00:31:13,084
The wind is my friend.

384
00:31:32,895 --> 00:31:34,522
This battle is just starting.

385
00:31:35,928 --> 00:31:36,929
<i>Wind Reversal!</i>

386
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,580
Die!

387
00:31:55,084 --> 00:31:57,420
Damn it! Hey, let go!

388
00:31:57,962 --> 00:32:03,217
Done already? I thought
we could play a little more...

389
00:32:10,391 --> 00:32:11,809
That's the spirit!

390
00:32:18,983 --> 00:32:21,069
What kind of toy is it this time?

391
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:39,921
That's funny. You think you can
defeat me with junk like this?

392
00:32:41,221 --> 00:32:43,057
The junk is your sword.

393
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,615
What?! A three headed dragon!

394
00:33:08,116 --> 00:33:10,535
You're just quick to escape, eh?

395
00:33:13,121 --> 00:33:14,372
<i>Damn it...</i>

396
00:33:14,681 --> 00:33:17,100
<i>Sure enough,
Crow is at a disadvantage</i>

397
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:18,692
<i>unless teamed up with Black Ant.</i>

398
00:33:40,314 --> 00:33:42,150
Not bad, Gaara of the desert.

399
00:33:43,568 --> 00:33:46,821
How much chakra is built up
in that sand?

400
00:33:47,738 --> 00:33:48,990
You want to find out?

401
00:33:49,866 --> 00:33:50,866
However...

402
00:33:51,492 --> 00:33:53,494
It'll be in exchange for your life.

403
00:34:00,356 --> 00:34:01,774
<i>Sand Coffin!</i>

404
00:34:18,769 --> 00:34:19,769
Impossible.

405
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,982
That's a nice sand bath.

406
00:34:24,525 --> 00:34:27,028
You, the sand's chakra...

407
00:34:27,528 --> 00:34:31,699
Exactly. This armor sucks up chakra.

408
00:34:39,415 --> 00:34:41,375
Aw, is this good night?

409
00:34:42,084 --> 00:34:45,213
That's it, keep sleeping...
For all eternity!

410
00:34:51,871 --> 00:34:52,871
What?!

411
00:35:05,013 --> 00:35:06,848
That was a close shave,

412
00:35:06,943 --> 00:35:08,903
but Shadow Possession
was a success!

413
00:35:13,521 --> 00:35:14,689
Die already!

414
00:35:17,078 --> 00:35:18,078
Uh, oh!

415
00:35:20,561 --> 00:35:21,211
<i>What?</i>

416
00:35:38,349 --> 00:35:39,349
You guys.

417
00:35:39,976 --> 00:35:41,102
Who are you?

418
00:35:42,103 --> 00:35:43,104
Who are you guys?

419
00:35:44,438 --> 00:35:46,198
- An ally of the Sand.
- An ally of the Sand.

420
00:35:46,274 --> 00:35:48,442
<i>Guys, fight as much as you want.</i>

421
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:53,281
<i>I don't see any chakra
abnormalities in the basin...</i>

422
00:35:53,781 --> 00:35:54,782
<i>There's no barrier.</i>

423
00:35:57,618 --> 00:35:59,120
<i>Good luck, guys.</i>

424
00:36:00,121 --> 00:36:01,622
<i>I'll protect you.</i>

425
00:36:15,303 --> 00:36:16,470
<i>Gaara Sensei.</i>

426
00:36:17,892 --> 00:36:19,714
I'll take care of all of you at once!

427
00:36:22,476 --> 00:36:23,476
Here it comes!

428
00:36:24,443 --> 00:36:26,403
To think you'd ask
the Leaf Village for help...

429
00:36:27,939 --> 00:36:30,220
I guess the Sand has lost the edge
they used to have, huh?

430
00:36:30,784 --> 00:36:31,785
Why are you here?

431
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,616
You know, dogs...

432
00:36:37,754 --> 00:36:41,633
They're not satisfied until a favor
has been properly returned.

433
00:36:41,911 --> 00:36:43,746
Especially Akamaru!

434
00:36:46,501 --> 00:36:49,171
A dog retuning a favor doesn't
have much of a ring to it!

435
00:36:50,038 --> 00:36:52,624
Help is on the way to
the other two as well.

436
00:36:53,299 --> 00:36:55,262
You concentrate on this fight!

437
00:36:56,742 --> 00:36:58,304
You're giving me lip!

438
00:36:58,672 --> 00:37:00,966
So you flies are gonna gang up
on me, huh?

439
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:04,823
But you're no match for my Dragon Eye:
Fang Release: Dark Sword.

440
00:37:05,144 --> 00:37:06,144
Eat this!

441
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:21,312
If your chakra isn't built up,
your sand is no big deal at all!

442
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,638
It'll only be useful for
blinding me at best!

443
00:37:26,155 --> 00:37:27,155
It's futile!

444
00:37:29,835 --> 00:37:33,005
I feel it.
Your chakra is being sucked up.

445
00:37:37,009 --> 00:37:40,346
What?! He was setting the sand
in the gourd aside?!

446
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:00,074
<i>I was being cautious,
but he is just too strong.</i>

447
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:06,307
Just what I'd expect from
Gaara of the Sand.

448
00:39:07,026 --> 00:39:09,570
He's not called the ultimate weapon
for nothing...

449
00:39:10,251 --> 00:39:12,337
The ultimate...weapon?

450
00:39:12,885 --> 00:39:15,471
However, he cannot exceed
our ninja tools,

451
00:39:15,496 --> 00:39:17,874
forged in the Village of the Artisans!

452
00:39:24,513 --> 00:39:25,513
Gaara!

453
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:30,413
Hey, he's totally got the edge!

454
00:39:30,687 --> 00:39:32,247
Do we have a chance to
return the favor?

455
00:39:40,074 --> 00:39:42,785
That's incredible wind.
What an amount of chakra...

456
00:39:43,195 --> 00:39:47,616
No, it seems that sword is
amplifying her chakra.

457
00:39:47,997 --> 00:39:51,084
So she's relying on that sword for
all of her attack and defense, huh?

458
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,915
We've got to slip within
firing range for our jutsu

459
00:39:57,136 --> 00:39:58,971
and stop her movements!

460
00:39:59,318 --> 00:39:59,888
Right.

461
00:40:00,986 --> 00:40:01,987
Let's go at once!

462
00:40:06,492 --> 00:40:08,244
Annoying!

463
00:40:21,048 --> 00:40:24,009
<i>She's attempting to maintain
her distance just from Temari.</i>

464
00:40:26,512 --> 00:40:27,512
<i>I see.</i>

465
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:30,644
<i>So she just wants to pay attention
to the long range type Temari and</i>

466
00:40:30,669 --> 00:40:33,369
<i>blow us mid range jutsu users
away with wind</i>

467
00:40:33,394 --> 00:40:35,187
<i>before we can get close, huh...?</i>

468
00:40:35,749 --> 00:40:37,584
<i>Now then, what should we do?</i>

469
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,193
<i>Man Beast Clone!</i>

470
00:40:42,892 --> 00:40:44,018
<i>Partial Expansion Jutsu!</i>

471
00:40:44,947 --> 00:40:45,947
<i>Crow!</i>

472
00:40:46,448 --> 00:40:47,950
<i>- Arms!
- Fang Over Fang!</i>

473
00:40:54,123 --> 00:40:55,916
Did you guys come to
get in my way?!

474
00:40:56,557 --> 00:40:58,309
We made sure to send you
a signal, right?!

475
00:40:59,253 --> 00:41:00,253
How could I tell?!

476
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:02,560
We don't click at all?

477
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:05,676
Are you guys...messing around?!

478
00:41:05,701 --> 00:41:07,661
Be more serious and die!

479
00:41:08,762 --> 00:41:10,139
Talking nonsense!

480
00:41:43,255 --> 00:41:46,634
<i>Although I reduced the damage
with my Infinite Kujaku Armor, still...</i>

481
00:41:53,586 --> 00:41:55,620
Just what I'd expect of Gaara,

482
00:41:55,645 --> 00:41:58,648
the Sand's ultimate weapon,
host to the Shukaku...

483
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:08,280
But you're already in our hands.

484
00:42:18,451 --> 00:42:21,954
<i>What should I do?
She's beyond the range of my jutsu...</i>

485
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:27,187
<i>and I don't see anything around here
that could be used to extend my shadow.</i>

486
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:33,521
Hey!

487
00:42:40,063 --> 00:42:41,940
What're you whispering about?

488
00:42:43,799 --> 00:42:45,593
What're you thinking?!

489
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:49,583
For crying out loud. I'll explain later.
Can you do it or not?

490
00:42:50,106 --> 00:42:51,775
I suppose I could try, but...

491
00:42:57,413 --> 00:42:58,413
What the...?

492
00:43:08,173 --> 00:43:09,173
What's he doing?

493
00:43:18,219 --> 00:43:22,640
Behold the terror of the ninja tools
our village created.

494
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,304
<i>What's this chakra?</i>

495
00:44:11,403 --> 00:44:13,405
<i>This is a water vein!</i>

496
00:44:14,448 --> 00:44:15,573
<i>I get it!</i>

497
00:44:15,598 --> 00:44:19,185
<i>The lines connecting the point
in the center isn't a barrier...</i>

498
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,662
<i>It's a water vein!</i>

499
00:44:20,879 --> 00:44:24,799
<i>Ninja Tool Barrier:
Reverse Scale Formation - Activate!</i>

500
00:44:41,426 --> 00:44:42,426
Oh no!

501
00:44:46,104 --> 00:44:49,316
The aim of the Reverse Scale Formation
was always a single point, Gaara!

502
00:44:49,817 --> 00:44:52,653
Our swords accurately pierce
a water vein

503
00:44:52,778 --> 00:44:54,488
and summon the water dragon.

504
00:44:54,865 --> 00:44:56,808
Sand has sucked up
a large amount of water

505
00:44:56,833 --> 00:44:58,348
and has become as heavy as lead...

506
00:44:59,073 --> 00:45:01,284
Now Gaara can no longer use sand.

507
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:04,890
Gaara!

508
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:06,448
- Gaara!
- Calm down!

509
00:45:06,991 --> 00:45:09,545
Lee and Naruto are heading for Gaara!

510
00:45:09,878 --> 00:45:10,878
They are?!

511
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:14,345
They'll save Gaara,
no matter what.

512
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:17,177
We need to concentrate on
the enemy in front of us.

513
00:45:28,801 --> 00:45:30,681
To think you'd choose
a sandy area to fall on...

514
00:45:31,044 --> 00:45:32,921
Just what I'd expect of Gaara
of the desert...

515
00:45:35,654 --> 00:45:36,654
However!

516
00:45:42,942 --> 00:45:44,777
That's as far as
your useless resistance goes!

517
00:45:45,796 --> 00:45:47,131
<i>Leaf Hurricane!</i>

518
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:53,117
A hero always comes late!

519
00:45:55,477 --> 00:45:56,645
That's right!

520
00:46:00,752 --> 00:46:02,072
Sorry to keep you waiting, Gaara!

521
00:46:02,681 --> 00:46:03,681
Naruto!

522
00:46:04,186 --> 00:46:07,473
It seems you rushed to everyone
during the Sasuke incident...

523
00:46:08,061 --> 00:46:10,689
This time we've come to return
the favor from back then.

524
00:46:11,192 --> 00:46:13,611
So we'll take that guy on!

525
00:46:14,276 --> 00:46:17,195
You hurry to your student up ahead!

526
00:46:22,203 --> 00:46:24,121
To think he'd corner you like this...

527
00:46:26,246 --> 00:46:27,873
- Lee!
- Sakura!

528
00:46:29,207 --> 00:46:32,961
Leave Gaara's treatment to me!
Lee, you go with Naruto!

529
00:46:33,045 --> 00:46:35,213
- Sakura!
- Got it!

530
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:40,790
Then I'll be going first!

531
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:44,308
Be careful. His armor sucks up chakra!

532
00:46:45,962 --> 00:46:49,132
I'll suck up all of your chakra!

533
00:46:54,301 --> 00:46:58,096
I see. So this means we can't
release our regular abilities?

534
00:46:58,470 --> 00:46:59,795
That doesn't matter!

535
00:47:00,298 --> 00:47:02,550
Even without chakra,
we've got fighting spirit!

536
00:47:04,886 --> 00:47:07,388
Yes! We'll go with that
plus willpower!

537
00:47:15,371 --> 00:47:16,539
<i>Just as I thought.</i>

538
00:47:16,702 --> 00:47:20,205
<i>The fact they haven't launched any
attacks during the fight means</i>

539
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,990
<i>the two reinforcements don't
have long range jutsu.</i>

540
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:25,764
<i>In that case...
I'll maintain this distance and...</i>

541
00:47:26,305 --> 00:47:28,390
You'll die getting torn up by the wind!

542
00:47:31,103 --> 00:47:33,438
<i>While she's distracted by Shikamaru
and the others,</i>

543
00:47:33,555 --> 00:47:34,556
<i>I'll just go for it!</i>

544
00:47:35,381 --> 00:47:36,632
<i>Mind Destruction...!</i>

545
00:47:38,951 --> 00:47:39,637
Ino!

546
00:47:40,362 --> 00:47:43,949
Foolish girl. It's useless to attempt
to exploit an opening!

547
00:47:44,253 --> 00:47:45,253
You little!

548
00:47:50,959 --> 00:47:55,421
You won't get close to me!
I've read your range as well!

549
00:47:56,345 --> 00:47:57,748
I don't know about that...!

550
00:47:58,101 --> 00:48:00,311
Ino! You stay right there!

551
00:48:05,155 --> 00:48:06,155
<i>I'm counting on you...</i>

552
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:07,781
<i>Shino! Sakura!</i>

553
00:48:12,615 --> 00:48:15,660
There's one wounded
at the waterfall.

554
00:48:16,087 --> 00:48:17,172
<i>Tunneling Fang!</i>

555
00:48:19,245 --> 00:48:19,924
Now!

556
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:21,939
<i>Partial Expansion Jutsu!</i>

557
00:48:23,229 --> 00:48:24,070
Oh...!

558
00:48:25,198 --> 00:48:26,408
What're you doing?!

559
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:29,802
Are you guys...mocking me?

560
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:34,427
After sucking up all of your chakra,
I'll be returning the favor plenty!

561
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,345
<i>The contusion treatment is complete.</i>

562
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:43,813
<i>But, the depletion of chakra
is overwhelming.</i>

563
00:48:49,537 --> 00:48:51,122
Contact from your friends?

564
00:48:51,505 --> 00:48:53,215
- Ino's hurt?!
- Go!

565
00:48:53,775 --> 00:48:56,444
Wha?! But in your condition...

566
00:48:58,058 --> 00:49:01,812
I'm okay now. Help your friend!

567
00:49:02,694 --> 00:49:05,113
Okay. Don't push yourself.

568
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:06,215
Yeah...

569
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:15,207
What're you doing?!
Hurry up and go after your comrade!

570
00:49:15,707 --> 00:49:17,209
I'll help my comrade.

571
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:19,734
I'll settle this in a moment.

572
00:49:19,759 --> 00:49:20,508
But...

573
00:49:22,554 --> 00:49:23,283
Bushy Brow!

574
00:49:29,221 --> 00:49:31,890
<i>Damn it. It's no good
just shot gunning it!</i>

575
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:34,910
<i>It's just him?</i>

576
00:49:40,429 --> 00:49:42,014
<i>A part of Black Ant...</i>

577
00:49:42,772 --> 00:49:45,316
<i>Could it be...a signal?</i>

578
00:49:46,104 --> 00:49:47,605
Fang Over Fang once more!

579
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,283
Back me up with Crow!

580
00:49:51,503 --> 00:49:53,183
I'm counting on you
for back up too, Choji!

581
00:49:53,621 --> 00:49:54,436
Got it!

582
00:49:55,769 --> 00:49:57,937
<i>Heh! Bossing me around.</i>

583
00:50:03,974 --> 00:50:05,809
Our counterattack starts now!

584
00:50:06,634 --> 00:50:09,345
It's futile.
Your jutsu won't reach me!

585
00:50:09,775 --> 00:50:12,611
You never know
until you try, right?

586
00:50:13,392 --> 00:50:14,060
Here we go!

587
00:50:14,312 --> 00:50:16,314
<i>Wind Style: Cyclone Scythe!</i>

588
00:50:17,769 --> 00:50:18,769
Huh?!

589
00:50:20,514 --> 00:50:23,184
What're you aiming at?!
Totally misguided...

590
00:50:24,818 --> 00:50:25,819
<i>Say what?</i>

591
00:50:26,744 --> 00:50:28,030
What's the meaning of this?

592
00:50:28,055 --> 00:50:30,391
I'm sure I read your range already!

593
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:32,615
I'll show you!

594
00:50:36,625 --> 00:50:39,767
I can create a shadow with
this thick a current

595
00:50:39,792 --> 00:50:41,070
even if the water's clear.

596
00:50:41,835 --> 00:50:46,840
My jutsu's range has infinitely
improved by lifting the waterfall!

597
00:50:48,459 --> 00:50:50,544
Shadow Possession
is a success!

598
00:50:52,637 --> 00:50:53,637
<i>Summoning...</i>

599
00:50:54,181 --> 00:50:55,307
<i>Blade Dance!</i>

600
00:51:11,656 --> 00:51:13,033
This one's done!

601
00:51:16,043 --> 00:51:17,461
<i>Good grief...</i>

602
00:51:20,667 --> 00:51:23,169
<i>I...couldn't do anything.</i>

603
00:51:24,802 --> 00:51:26,137
<i>Everyone's doing their best...</i>

604
00:51:27,214 --> 00:51:28,214
<i>Only I...</i>

605
00:51:29,764 --> 00:51:30,764
Ino?

606
00:51:32,413 --> 00:51:33,135
Gaara.

607
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:41,223
You don't have any sand
left you can use.

608
00:51:44,674 --> 00:51:45,508
What's this?!

609
00:51:45,533 --> 00:51:47,035
He smashed the Sand Armor.

610
00:51:48,026 --> 00:51:52,197
No way! But the sand's
heavy with water...

611
00:51:52,533 --> 00:51:54,410
If I just suck up your chakra, then...

612
00:51:57,068 --> 00:51:58,778
This is my weapon!

613
00:52:15,637 --> 00:52:16,888
You okay, Gaara?!

614
00:52:17,835 --> 00:52:19,003
This is the finishing blow...

615
00:52:20,348 --> 00:52:21,440
Gaara Sensei!

616
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:24,396
Hurry! Leave the rest to us!

617
00:52:27,397 --> 00:52:28,607
<i>Man Beast Clone!</i>

618
00:52:28,971 --> 00:52:29,805
<i>Fang Over Fang!</i>

619
00:52:29,985 --> 00:52:31,569
<i>Partial Expansion Jutsu!</i>

620
00:52:33,905 --> 00:52:35,782
Annoying buzzing flies!

621
00:52:36,408 --> 00:52:38,076
<i>Dragon Eye: Fang Release: Dark Sword!</i>

622
00:52:46,251 --> 00:52:46,975
What?!

623
00:52:47,635 --> 00:52:48,260
Oh, no!

624
00:52:51,631 --> 00:52:52,924
<i>Puppet Show...</i>

625
00:52:56,568 --> 00:52:58,695
<i>Secret Black Move Iron Maiden!</i>

626
00:53:08,997 --> 00:53:09,873
The show's over!

627
00:53:09,993 --> 00:53:11,411
- We did it!
- Yeah!

628
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:17,321
<i>Matsuri.</i>

629
00:53:23,273 --> 00:53:24,274
<i>Gaara and...</i>

630
00:53:24,906 --> 00:53:26,532
<i>A shinobi carrying a child on his back.</i>

631
00:53:27,273 --> 00:53:29,108
<i>He's heading for the valley.</i>

632
00:53:30,357 --> 00:53:31,358
The last one...

633
00:53:32,797 --> 00:53:33,798
Gaara is chasing him!

634
00:53:33,949 --> 00:53:34,685
What?!

635
00:53:39,437 --> 00:53:43,274
You okay, Bushy Brow?
Sakura will be right back.

636
00:53:43,527 --> 00:53:44,375
Thanks.

637
00:53:44,585 --> 00:53:46,587
Well, I'm going after Gaara!

638
00:53:46,658 --> 00:53:49,328
Got it! I'll meet up with you later!

639
00:54:05,765 --> 00:54:08,601
This is as far as you go.
Give Matsuri back.

640
00:54:09,951 --> 00:54:11,578
You think you've got me cornered now?

641
00:54:13,713 --> 00:54:17,550
Don't get the wrong idea.
You're the one who's been cornered!

642
00:54:18,009 --> 00:54:18,722
What?

643
00:54:21,346 --> 00:54:22,346
<i>Byakugan!</i>

644
00:54:24,682 --> 00:54:27,852
<i>He has the final enemy cornered
in a dead end valley.</i>

645
00:54:30,397 --> 00:54:33,024
The area around the valley
is eerily calm.

646
00:54:33,858 --> 00:54:35,235
I don't see his comrades.

647
00:54:37,404 --> 00:54:39,197
Is Shikamaru's final move finished?

648
00:54:40,507 --> 00:54:41,226
No.

649
00:54:41,783 --> 00:54:44,202
We can't state definitively that
they've reached a deadlock.

650
00:54:45,036 --> 00:54:49,249
It's possible that
the battles thus far were diversions...

651
00:54:57,637 --> 00:54:59,015
Just a little more, Lee.

652
00:54:59,648 --> 00:55:01,900
It'll be over once I connect
two or three more muscles.

653
00:55:03,921 --> 00:55:07,091
<i>Sakura's Medical Ninja technique
is really becoming...</i>

654
00:55:08,691 --> 00:55:09,984
<i>And yet I...</i>

655
00:55:13,064 --> 00:55:18,570
The treatment is over for now.
How do keep ending up like this?

656
00:55:19,284 --> 00:55:20,284
I'm sorry.

657
00:55:20,862 --> 00:55:24,199
You saved me.
Thank you, Sakura.

658
00:55:25,076 --> 00:55:26,077
You're welcome.

659
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,450
Oh, you can't, yet.

660
00:55:28,663 --> 00:55:32,959
As a Medical Team member,
I prohibit you from fighting any further.

661
00:55:33,226 --> 00:55:35,103
No, please let me go.

662
00:55:35,842 --> 00:55:38,637
I can't just leave Gaara like this...

663
00:55:39,379 --> 00:55:41,839
We're Team Return the Favor, after all.

664
00:55:47,707 --> 00:55:51,389
Gaara, you may very well be
called the ultimate weapon,

665
00:55:51,616 --> 00:55:55,494
but have you not used up all of
your sand in the fight earlier?

666
00:55:57,965 --> 00:56:00,009
<i>This is my weapon.</i>

667
00:56:00,914 --> 00:56:05,835
<i>Indeed, I have used up almost all
of the sand with chakra built up inside.</i>

668
00:56:06,584 --> 00:56:07,288
<i>But...</i>

669
00:56:07,749 --> 00:56:13,588
No matter what jutsu you use,
I can't lose in a one on one battle.

670
00:56:15,011 --> 00:56:17,556
There's nothing scary about
a shinobi with no weapon!

671
00:56:22,314 --> 00:56:24,566
Come, Infinite Kujaku Armor!

672
00:56:35,647 --> 00:56:38,983
<i>Fang Release: Dark Sword!
Flying Double Edge Sword!</i>

673
00:56:46,491 --> 00:56:50,220
You'll realize that the likes
of a mere ninja

674
00:56:50,245 --> 00:56:53,665
is no match for the ninja tools
created by us artisans.

675
00:57:10,098 --> 00:57:11,933
<i>Fang Release: Dark Sword!</i>

676
00:57:20,692 --> 00:57:23,111
It seems your own body's chakra
has run out.

677
00:57:23,831 --> 00:57:27,126
You're carrying
a monster inside you, right?

678
00:57:29,409 --> 00:57:33,413
Now, isn't it about time
you used the power of the Shukaku?

679
00:57:53,442 --> 00:57:54,442
You okay?

680
00:57:54,645 --> 00:57:55,646
Gaara Sensei is...

681
00:57:55,893 --> 00:57:57,895
Yeah, I know.

682
00:57:59,081 --> 00:58:02,251
Listen up.
You go hide somehwere safe.

683
00:58:02,671 --> 00:58:03,336
Right.

684
00:58:04,511 --> 00:58:08,352
Although Gaara received
Sakura's treatment, he's still...

685
00:58:15,455 --> 00:58:18,958
That's as far as you go,
ultimate weapon of the Sand Village!

686
00:58:20,818 --> 00:58:21,860
Damn it.

687
00:58:22,286 --> 00:58:24,498
Use the power of the Shukaku already.

688
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:25,707
Hey!

689
00:58:26,123 --> 00:58:27,169
Hold it!

690
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,178
Who are you?

691
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:34,015
I'll be your opponent from here on.

692
00:58:34,561 --> 00:58:35,937
You're in the way, boy.

693
00:58:36,138 --> 00:58:38,391
<i>Kujaku Hurricane!</i>

694
00:58:44,367 --> 00:58:45,460
Damn it!

695
00:58:45,610 --> 00:58:47,862
Just watch, Leaf shinobi.

696
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:50,761
The era of control by
the Five Great Nations will end.

697
00:58:51,389 --> 00:58:52,890
No, it won't be just that.

698
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:57,964
If the ultimate ninja tool created by
the Artisan Village is completed,

699
00:58:58,146 --> 00:59:02,120
the existence of the ninja
will no longer be necessary.

700
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:04,775
What're you talking about?!

701
00:59:05,312 --> 00:59:08,107
We are people from the Village
of Artisans who for many years

702
00:59:08,132 --> 00:59:10,843
have equally shared
exceptional ninja tools

703
00:59:10,868 --> 00:59:12,745
with you in the Five Great Nations.

704
00:59:13,485 --> 00:59:16,154
However, each time relations
worsened between fellow villages,

705
00:59:16,533 --> 00:59:18,368
the Village of Artisans would be attacked

706
00:59:18,393 --> 00:59:21,020
over fear of ninja tools crossing
over to the other village.

707
00:59:21,688 --> 00:59:24,424
You ninja of the Five Great Nations
have forgotten

708
00:59:24,449 --> 00:59:27,295
that you are kept alive by our power,

709
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:29,601
and have returned the favor
with vengeance time and again.

710
00:59:29,821 --> 00:59:33,032
Although we have advanced skills,

711
00:59:33,057 --> 00:59:37,312
we have had to survive by currying favor
from the Five Great Nations!

712
00:59:38,638 --> 00:59:41,211
However, that era will now end!

713
00:59:41,713 --> 00:59:44,048
First, I will take out the Leaf Village.

714
00:59:44,073 --> 00:59:45,991
<i>Fang Release Dark Sword!</i>

715
00:59:49,549 --> 00:59:51,676
How long can you run away for?

716
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:01,352
I'll stake you like a shrike!

717
01:00:06,733 --> 01:00:07,733
What?!

718
01:00:14,699 --> 01:00:15,742
You!

719
01:00:16,138 --> 01:00:19,517
That dome's created with hard minerals
in the ground mixed with sand...

720
01:00:20,165 --> 01:00:23,085
It can't be smashed by such junk.

721
01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:25,893
I'll protect him until the end...

722
01:00:27,044 --> 01:00:28,546
with my power!

723
01:00:29,422 --> 01:00:30,715
Don't make me laugh!

724
01:00:31,257 --> 01:00:35,880
You, who are called the greatest creation
of the Sand, a terrifying weapon,

725
01:00:35,905 --> 01:00:37,573
are going to protect someone else?

726
01:00:37,988 --> 01:00:40,199
And you're going to use
what little chakra you have left

727
01:00:40,224 --> 01:00:41,726
for the sake of a comrade?

728
01:00:42,453 --> 01:00:45,748
That will be your death!

729
01:00:53,738 --> 01:00:56,491
With this,
all preparations are complete.

730
01:00:57,408 --> 01:00:58,408
Damn it!

731
01:01:03,831 --> 01:01:04,831
Oh!

732
01:01:10,301 --> 01:01:12,582
We were contacted by someone
from the Village of Artisans.

733
01:01:13,633 --> 01:01:15,810
It seems ones calling themselves
the Four Celestials,

734
01:01:15,835 --> 01:01:18,134
bearing long withstanding hostilities
against the Five Great Nations...

735
01:01:18,462 --> 01:01:22,341
have completed forbidden research and
are attempting to resurrect

736
01:01:22,414 --> 01:01:24,414
the ultimate weapon of folklore
in their village...

737
01:01:24,912 --> 01:01:27,748
It seems the villagers caught
wind of the crisis

738
01:01:27,995 --> 01:01:29,955
and have evacuated to
a different location.

739
01:01:30,173 --> 01:01:33,719
I see. So that's why the village
was completely empty.

740
01:01:34,612 --> 01:01:37,761
So what exactly is this ultimate weapon?

741
01:01:39,073 --> 01:01:41,910
The resurrection of Seimei,
the founder of the Village of Artisans.

742
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:43,621
Seimei?!

743
01:01:44,121 --> 01:01:46,041
Are you saying
they're trying to raise the dead?!

744
01:01:47,291 --> 01:01:50,962
I see. That explains why
the mausoleum was violated.

745
01:01:51,629 --> 01:01:54,465
As for us, we must prevent
the resurrection

746
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,337
of the ultimate weapon at all costs.

747
01:01:57,095 --> 01:01:58,597
I understand. I'll be off.

748
01:01:59,734 --> 01:02:00,986
Oh, hold on.

749
01:02:01,639 --> 01:02:02,223
Yes?

750
01:02:02,315 --> 01:02:05,318
I'll be having one more person
accompany you on this mission.

751
01:02:05,685 --> 01:02:07,311
What? Who would that be?

752
01:02:14,318 --> 01:02:16,988
What we wanted was
the Shukaku's chakra.

753
01:02:17,655 --> 01:02:18,655
What did you say?

754
01:02:19,156 --> 01:02:21,200
How we've waited for this...

755
01:02:21,993 --> 01:02:24,996
Now Gaara, release the Shukaku now!

756
01:02:25,267 --> 01:02:27,686
And infuse me with that power.

757
01:02:27,915 --> 01:02:28,915
Gaara!

758
01:02:29,767 --> 01:02:31,034
I'll save you now.

759
01:02:31,544 --> 01:02:32,398
Naruto!

760
01:02:35,404 --> 01:02:36,780
<i>Matsuri, take this.</i>

761
01:02:41,602 --> 01:02:42,895
My rope javelin.

762
01:02:54,514 --> 01:02:56,307
The optic nerves have connected...

763
01:02:57,733 --> 01:02:58,776
Open...

764
01:03:00,146 --> 01:03:01,093
third eye!

765
01:03:05,202 --> 01:03:06,704
Hey, you.

766
01:03:08,039 --> 01:03:10,207
What the heck do you intend to do?

767
01:03:10,791 --> 01:03:13,547
Create the ultimate ninja tool
with Lord Seimei,

768
01:03:13,572 --> 01:03:16,075
the founder of our Village of Artisans.

769
01:03:16,621 --> 01:03:18,289
Ultimate ninja tool?

770
01:03:19,897 --> 01:03:22,024
Now is the time of its completion.

771
01:03:41,777 --> 01:03:42,537
Gaara!

772
01:04:00,257 --> 01:04:02,301
Oh, Lord Seimei.

773
01:04:02,326 --> 01:04:06,664
Please take possession of my flesh
and complete your resurrection!

774
01:04:10,851 --> 01:04:13,437
Oh!

775
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:31,243
What's going on? He vanished.

776
01:04:48,347 --> 01:04:49,974
The dead body came back to life!

777
01:04:52,270 --> 01:04:56,441
I am Seimei.
The founder of the Village of Artisans.

778
01:04:58,249 --> 01:05:00,543
A hundred years have passed and

779
01:05:00,568 --> 01:05:03,242
I have now been resurrected
as the ultimate ninja tool

780
01:05:03,267 --> 01:05:04,476
of the Village of Artisans!

781
01:05:13,277 --> 01:05:15,446
What in the world is happening?!

782
01:05:26,218 --> 01:05:30,681
My long awaited wish has at last
come to fruition.

783
01:05:31,390 --> 01:05:35,519
With this, my Village of Artisans
will reign over the shinobi apex!

784
01:05:36,906 --> 01:05:37,907
I see...

785
01:05:38,639 --> 01:05:42,726
So the monster from the Sand Village
became the source of my power.

786
01:05:43,672 --> 01:05:44,756
Say what?

787
01:05:44,921 --> 01:05:46,923
Hoko said this.

788
01:05:47,730 --> 01:05:50,149
There is a monster lying
within the body

789
01:05:50,174 --> 01:05:52,621
of the one called Gaara
from the Sand Village.

790
01:05:52,646 --> 01:05:54,624
Once that person is in a cage,

791
01:05:54,649 --> 01:05:57,819
soon he will become
a complete monster, the Shukaku.

792
01:05:59,566 --> 01:06:04,321
I will take away what you could
consider infinite chakra from the Shukaku.

793
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:07,557
I won't let you do that!

794
01:06:34,411 --> 01:06:35,411
Damn it!

795
01:06:42,879 --> 01:06:45,965
Just wait, Gaara.
I'll get you out now.

796
01:06:49,301 --> 01:06:50,761
What a waste...

797
01:06:51,723 --> 01:06:53,058
<i>Vortex Wind.</i>

798
01:06:59,145 --> 01:07:00,187
I'm just getting started!

799
01:07:01,105 --> 01:07:02,273
What a fool!

800
01:07:09,655 --> 01:07:11,949
I'll get you out now!

801
01:07:13,534 --> 01:07:15,286
Damn it, damn it!

802
01:07:16,704 --> 01:07:19,331
Gaara! Can you hear my voice?!

803
01:07:20,624 --> 01:07:23,711
Gaara, answer me!
What's going on in there?!

804
01:07:24,336 --> 01:07:25,336
Gaara!

805
01:07:25,462 --> 01:07:26,505
Gaara!

806
01:07:34,555 --> 01:07:36,182
N-Naruto...

807
01:07:55,330 --> 01:07:56,330
Shikamaru!

808
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:57,597
What?

809
01:07:57,995 --> 01:08:00,164
Where are Gaara and Naruto?

810
01:08:00,792 --> 01:08:03,962
Neji, Hinata, tell me the situation.

811
01:08:04,585 --> 01:08:07,046
There's a cage behind an area
surrounded by rocks...

812
01:08:07,922 --> 01:08:11,008
There's a massive amount of chakra
being extracted from there.

813
01:08:11,582 --> 01:08:13,084
Gaara must be inside.

814
01:08:13,844 --> 01:08:15,012
Hey, Shikamaru!

815
01:08:17,348 --> 01:08:18,015
What?

816
01:08:18,349 --> 01:08:22,436
You know there's a terrifying power
lying dormant inside Gaara, right?

817
01:08:22,937 --> 01:08:24,855
Yeah, generally.

818
01:08:25,488 --> 01:08:27,866
Something terrible will happen...

819
01:08:28,025 --> 01:08:32,696
if Gaara has chakra extracted like this
and he loses himself!

820
01:08:33,501 --> 01:08:36,050
The Shukaku that had been kept
under control will go out of control.

821
01:08:36,075 --> 01:08:39,287
Once it starts going berserk,
there will be no way to stop Gaara.

822
01:08:39,954 --> 01:08:40,954
For real?

823
01:08:41,966 --> 01:08:45,053
I must not waste any more time.

824
01:08:45,209 --> 01:08:47,044
This entertainment ends here.

825
01:08:53,145 --> 01:08:54,479
Hot-hot-hot-hot.

826
01:08:55,841 --> 01:08:59,261
Damn it! Just wait, Gaara!

827
01:08:59,286 --> 01:09:00,730
I'll get you out now!

828
01:09:02,091 --> 01:09:03,717
You're a pest!

829
01:09:04,109 --> 01:09:05,694
Give it up already!

830
01:09:11,819 --> 01:09:13,070
I'm just getting started!

831
01:09:20,838 --> 01:09:22,413
<i>Solid Blanks!</i>

832
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:45,811
Oh, how I have waited for this.

833
01:09:47,104 --> 01:09:50,774
Now, Shukaku! Give me power!

834
01:09:59,549 --> 01:10:03,053
I feel it. This is an amazing power!

835
01:10:26,352 --> 01:10:28,454
Cut out the futile resistance.

836
01:10:28,479 --> 01:10:31,315
The power of the Shukaku
is already mine!

837
01:10:31,885 --> 01:10:34,679
I declare war on the Five Great Nations!

838
01:10:35,170 --> 01:10:39,841
The shinobi in the Five Great Nations
who made light of the Artisan shinobi

839
01:10:40,189 --> 01:10:44,860
will fully realize the 100 year grudge
of the Artisan ninja.

840
01:10:45,829 --> 01:10:48,874
And they will inevitably
become our sacrifices.

841
01:10:49,018 --> 01:10:50,228
Knock it off!

842
01:10:50,513 --> 01:10:51,085
What?!

843
01:10:51,335 --> 01:10:57,007
We won't hand over our power
to the likes of you.

844
01:10:57,744 --> 01:11:01,873
I won't let you take away any more
of Gaara's chakra.

845
01:11:01,991 --> 01:11:02,946
You got that?!

846
01:11:03,263 --> 01:11:06,266
Why do you go this far, kid?

847
01:11:07,065 --> 01:11:10,568
What is the monster of
the Sand Village to you?

848
01:11:11,169 --> 01:11:12,337
Gaara...

849
01:11:14,024 --> 01:11:17,611
Gaara is an important comrade to me!

850
01:11:18,652 --> 01:11:22,490
<i>He said he fights for
those important to him.</i>

851
01:11:26,078 --> 01:11:28,747
Very well. Then die!

852
01:11:39,330 --> 01:11:41,207
What're you doing, little girl?

853
01:11:42,469 --> 01:11:45,722
I finally figured out what
Gaara Sensei taught me.

854
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:48,929
Weapons took away the lives
of my mother and father.

855
01:11:49,549 --> 01:11:53,344
But I can also protect those important
to me with a weapon!

856
01:11:54,606 --> 01:11:55,941
Foolishness.

857
01:12:05,784 --> 01:12:06,784
Damn it!

858
01:12:12,490 --> 01:12:14,117
It has finally begun, huh...?

859
01:12:27,139 --> 01:12:28,474
Gaara Sensei...

860
01:12:37,559 --> 01:12:38,483
Gaara!

861
01:12:54,291 --> 01:12:55,291
Gaara.

862
01:13:03,738 --> 01:13:06,283
So this is the Shukaku?

863
01:13:06,845 --> 01:13:09,139
It's the first time I've seen
the real thing...

864
01:13:11,725 --> 01:13:13,644
It's dangerous here!
We have to get away!

865
01:13:13,894 --> 01:13:15,812
But! Gaara Sensei...

866
01:13:17,064 --> 01:13:18,190
Shut up.

867
01:13:18,696 --> 01:13:22,366
Gaara is trying...to protect you!

868
01:13:22,737 --> 01:13:23,447
So hurry!

869
01:13:23,682 --> 01:13:24,910
R-Right.

870
01:13:28,027 --> 01:13:29,987
Hey! Could that be?!

871
01:13:30,284 --> 01:13:31,284
Yeah...

872
01:13:31,629 --> 01:13:33,149
The Shukaku transformation
is starting.

873
01:13:34,915 --> 01:13:35,915
Gaara...

874
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:37,750
Naruto!

875
01:13:38,787 --> 01:13:39,787
Naruto!

876
01:13:40,170 --> 01:13:42,005
Hinata, Sakura.

877
01:13:42,923 --> 01:13:44,675
Matsuri, you okay?

878
01:13:44,841 --> 01:13:47,678
Y-Yes. But Gaara Sensei...

879
01:13:48,612 --> 01:13:50,614
I leave her to you...

880
01:13:58,855 --> 01:14:01,233
Hold it! You're badly hurt!

881
01:14:04,194 --> 01:14:05,195
But...

882
01:14:05,285 --> 01:14:07,662
You'll become unable
to move as soon as you start!

883
01:14:08,365 --> 01:14:09,842
I'll give you some first aid treatment!

884
01:14:09,866 --> 01:14:10,951
R-Right...

885
01:14:21,777 --> 01:14:23,062
What's the meaning of this?

886
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:24,798
What is it, Neji?

887
01:14:25,882 --> 01:14:29,611
That guy wearing the armor is
releasing chakra stronger than Gaara...

888
01:14:29,636 --> 01:14:31,638
who's half transformed into a beast.

889
01:14:32,874 --> 01:14:37,003
That person called himself Seimei,
the creator of the Village of Artisans.

890
01:14:37,661 --> 01:14:40,205
He said something about being reborn
as the ultimate ninja tool.

891
01:14:40,690 --> 01:14:44,194
That jerk!
He's taking away Gaara's chakra!

892
01:14:44,592 --> 01:14:48,411
Come to think of it, the enemy
we fought wore similar armor...

893
01:14:48,947 --> 01:14:50,782
and took away a great deal
of my chakra.

894
01:14:51,421 --> 01:14:53,214
Armor that sucks up chakra...

895
01:14:53,861 --> 01:14:55,530
And that alarming form...

896
01:14:55,952 --> 01:14:57,930
It doesn't look like
we can just carelessly get close.

897
01:14:57,955 --> 01:15:00,416
Great...What do we do?

898
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:05,339
I didn't plan on fighting
against the Shukaku...

899
01:15:05,777 --> 01:15:08,363
However, this is quite fun.

900
01:15:08,967 --> 01:15:12,012
As great as the Shukaku may be,
this way, I can prove that

901
01:15:12,037 --> 01:15:15,291
it's no match for the ultimate ninja tool
of the Village of Artisans.

902
01:15:26,610 --> 01:15:30,489
<i>Why is this guy so strong?</i>

903
01:15:32,616 --> 01:15:35,494
<i>I won't allow my friends...</i>

904
01:15:35,873 --> 01:15:37,667
<i>to get hurt!</i>

905
01:15:38,955 --> 01:15:43,232
<i>I will stop you,</i>

906
01:15:43,257 --> 01:15:45,237
<i>even if that means that
I have to kill you!</i>

907
01:15:46,129 --> 01:15:47,130
<i>Why...?</i>

908
01:15:48,131 --> 01:15:51,134
<i>How is it that you can fight
so much for other people...?</i>

909
01:15:52,219 --> 01:15:56,014
<i>They saved me from
the hell of being all alone.</i>

910
01:15:56,866 --> 01:15:58,951
<i>They accepted me for
who I was...</i>

911
01:16:00,587 --> 01:16:03,632
<i>that's why...
they are important to me!</i>

912
01:16:06,297 --> 01:16:10,885
<i>Love is a heart that desires to serve
a precious person who is close to oneself,</i>

913
01:16:11,219 --> 01:16:13,722
<i>and to love and watch over that person...</i>

914
01:16:15,242 --> 01:16:16,743
<i>Love...</i>

915
01:16:18,566 --> 01:16:21,277
<i>That is why he is so strong?</i>

916
01:16:46,773 --> 01:16:47,774
Gaara!

917
01:16:47,858 --> 01:16:50,610
What's that?
Gaara Sensei is returning to normal?

918
01:16:51,065 --> 01:16:52,734
What happened to him?!

919
01:16:53,405 --> 01:16:57,618
Gaara might be suppressing
Shukaku of his own volition.

920
01:16:58,034 --> 01:17:02,038
Why? Wouldn't he end up weakening
his own battle strength?

921
01:17:02,481 --> 01:17:07,427
Even so, he chose to fight
with his own strength and will,

922
01:17:07,452 --> 01:17:10,246
not Shukaku's power,
which he can't control.

923
01:17:32,547 --> 01:17:36,287
So you couldn't maintain
the Shukaku body with that chakra?

924
01:17:36,687 --> 01:17:41,442
I'll...help the friends important
to me with my own power...

925
01:17:42,149 --> 01:17:43,192
How absurd.

926
01:17:43,772 --> 01:17:45,858
A shinobi doesn't need emotion.

927
01:17:46,285 --> 01:17:50,581
It is those who suppress their emotions
who can obtain great power.

928
01:17:51,115 --> 01:17:55,620
Great power.
That power is the only justice.

929
01:17:56,047 --> 01:17:57,841
You're finished now.

930
01:18:03,159 --> 01:18:04,160
Eat this!

931
01:18:13,441 --> 01:18:16,694
That's as far as you go,
monster of the Sand Village.

932
01:18:22,869 --> 01:18:23,953
Acting tough, huh?

933
01:18:24,704 --> 01:18:29,626
You shouldn't have
any chakra left to fight with.

934
01:18:30,168 --> 01:18:32,671
Indeed, I only have a little bit
of chakra left...

935
01:18:33,338 --> 01:18:38,635
But do you think I just sat around
in that cage doing nothing at all?

936
01:18:38,802 --> 01:18:39,802
What?!

937
01:18:41,805 --> 01:18:43,306
<i>Sand Tsunami!</i>

938
01:18:48,765 --> 01:18:52,936
You shouldn't have
any sand you can control!

939
01:18:53,191 --> 01:18:54,860
I'm Gaara of the desert!

940
01:18:55,371 --> 01:18:58,875
It's simple for me to crush rocks
and turn them into sand.

941
01:19:47,704 --> 01:19:49,456
<i>Kujaku: Hurricane Formation!</i>

942
01:19:54,127 --> 01:19:56,880
So you still had
that much power left, huh?

943
01:19:57,297 --> 01:20:00,800
Then I'll just suck up
all of that power!

944
01:20:08,767 --> 01:20:10,435
Gaara's chakra is being sucked out!

945
01:20:10,810 --> 01:20:12,562
- Wha?!
- Gaara Sensei!

946
01:20:12,876 --> 01:20:14,377
- Damn it!
- Wait! Naruto!

947
01:20:14,846 --> 01:20:16,848
What, Shikamaru? Don't stop me!

948
01:20:17,179 --> 01:20:18,890
You'll just get in the way if you go!

949
01:20:19,444 --> 01:20:21,404
Besides, Gaara is strong!

950
01:20:24,347 --> 01:20:25,210
Gaara...

951
01:20:34,290 --> 01:20:36,125
<i>Extreme Tempered Ultimate Attack:</i>

952
01:20:37,170 --> 01:20:38,296
<i>Shukaku's Pike!</i>

953
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:57,482
Wh-Why...Why can you...?

954
01:20:57,787 --> 01:21:01,456
Someone who gave up on being human
and was reborn as a ninja tool

955
01:21:01,481 --> 01:21:03,020
could never understand anyway.

956
01:21:05,865 --> 01:21:07,951
I don't understand. Why?

957
01:21:08,535 --> 01:21:10,290
Why?!

958
01:21:16,334 --> 01:21:17,711
<i>Giant Sand Burial!</i>

959
01:21:29,822 --> 01:21:31,073
He did it!

960
01:21:31,391 --> 01:21:33,226
Gaara Sensei won!

961
01:21:33,309 --> 01:21:34,811
Yeah! Gaara!

962
01:21:41,901 --> 01:21:43,319
- Gaara!
- Gaara!

963
01:21:48,351 --> 01:21:49,352
He's okay...

964
01:21:49,826 --> 01:21:51,411
He's just extremely fatigued

965
01:21:51,494 --> 01:21:53,174
on account of using
his chakra all at once.

966
01:21:53,923 --> 01:21:57,426
Gaara completely suppressed
the Shukaku on his own volition.

967
01:21:58,084 --> 01:21:59,084
Yeah...

968
01:22:01,945 --> 01:22:03,642
We came to the trouble
of rushing here.

969
01:22:04,340 --> 01:22:06,092
To think it'd be over...

970
01:22:07,427 --> 01:22:09,527
It seems
the inexperienced knuckleheads

971
01:22:09,552 --> 01:22:13,010
have grown a teeny weeny bit...

972
01:22:14,017 --> 01:22:15,185
You are very strict.

973
01:22:44,834 --> 01:22:45,918
Pervy Sage!

974
01:22:46,421 --> 01:22:48,912
Oh, long time no see, Naruto.

975
01:22:49,144 --> 01:22:52,039
Don't give me that "long time no see"
garbage, you jerk Sage!

976
01:22:52,555 --> 01:22:54,283
You were talking all big about
watching my training,

977
01:22:54,307 --> 01:22:56,601
making me into your protege
and stuff!

978
01:22:56,852 --> 01:22:59,021
Where were you traipsing
around until now?!

979
01:22:59,622 --> 01:23:03,626
Well, how can I put this?
I was gathering information.

980
01:23:03,710 --> 01:23:07,171
It was probably just information
on naked ladies anyway, right?

981
01:23:07,196 --> 01:23:08,712
You idiot!

982
01:23:09,324 --> 01:23:11,493
Even I come through when it counts...

983
01:23:11,974 --> 01:23:15,352
I was mainly after information
on the Akatsuki.

984
01:23:15,968 --> 01:23:16,968
Akatsuki...

985
01:23:17,288 --> 01:23:19,916
With this I've been able
to verify their actions.

986
01:23:20,458 --> 01:23:22,752
And now as promised,

987
01:23:22,794 --> 01:23:26,256
I believe they'll begin to move
in two years. So...

988
01:23:26,321 --> 01:23:28,907
Before that happens,
I will thoroughly train you.

989
01:23:36,266 --> 01:23:38,309
I wonder if you're ready?

990
01:23:40,186 --> 01:23:41,813
I've been tired of waiting!

991
01:23:53,449 --> 01:23:54,617
I owe you one.

992
01:23:55,118 --> 01:23:58,705
No. I just repaid the debt
from last time.

993
01:23:59,335 --> 01:24:01,671
Next time, I'll settle things
more properly.

994
01:24:02,245 --> 01:24:05,581
Well, at least
this time you didn't cry.

995
01:24:05,962 --> 01:24:07,213
Not that again.

996
01:24:07,774 --> 01:24:09,209
Just like a woman...

997
01:24:09,799 --> 01:24:10,800
What about him?

998
01:24:10,926 --> 01:24:11,608
Huh?

999
01:24:12,003 --> 01:24:13,629
Naruto?

1000
01:24:14,436 --> 01:24:17,148
I hear he's leaving today on
a training journey with Jiraiya.

1001
01:24:17,486 --> 01:24:19,770
Jiraiya?
One of the Legendary Sannin?

1002
01:24:20,171 --> 01:24:22,631
Yeah.
It's such a pain.

1003
01:24:22,919 --> 01:24:26,089
He's going to come back
having gotten stronger again.

1004
01:24:27,551 --> 01:24:28,551
See you around.

1005
01:24:28,931 --> 01:24:30,599
- Farewell...
- See ya.

1006
01:24:36,201 --> 01:24:38,077
Please tell Naruto...

1007
01:24:39,362 --> 01:24:40,905
Thanks to him,

1008
01:24:40,976 --> 01:24:43,645
I figured out what the words
Gaara Sensei spoke of meant.

1009
01:24:45,014 --> 01:24:48,609
I'll dedicate myself under
Gaara Sensei from now on...

1010
01:24:57,073 --> 01:24:58,468
What did he do?

1011
01:25:11,236 --> 01:25:13,029
Well, I guess that's about it.

1012
01:25:35,084 --> 01:25:39,088
I read the Village of Artisans report
from the other day.

1013
01:25:42,767 --> 01:25:44,560
Although it wasn't a perfect 100,

1014
01:25:44,602 --> 01:25:45,802
I'll give you a passing grade.

1015
01:25:45,982 --> 01:25:47,710
No! I'm still very much lacking
in experience.

1016
01:25:47,735 --> 01:25:48,735
Of course!

1017
01:25:49,148 --> 01:25:51,985
I'll have you carry out
several missions

1018
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:54,189
and get you to build up
lots of experience,

1019
01:25:54,214 --> 01:25:55,275
so make sure to dedicate yourself!

1020
01:25:55,405 --> 01:25:59,409
What?! Does that mean
I'm totally going to get overworked?

1021
01:26:09,206 --> 01:26:10,639
Ah, there you are!

1022
01:26:10,970 --> 01:26:11,917
Pervy sage!

1023
01:26:12,109 --> 01:26:14,382
When are we going to start training?

1024
01:26:14,863 --> 01:26:16,183
Hang on a minute...

1025
01:26:16,971 --> 01:26:19,531
Just let me finish this paragraph.

1026
01:26:19,882 --> 01:26:21,036
What are you writing?

1027
01:26:21,259 --> 01:26:23,012
Oh! Well, uh...

1028
01:26:23,461 --> 01:26:25,621
I'm writing about my life.

1029
01:26:25,935 --> 01:26:28,675
It's called,
"The Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant"!

1030
01:26:28,989 --> 01:26:30,089
Your life?

1031
01:26:30,345 --> 01:26:34,239
The meetings, farewells,
and various other happenings.

1032
01:26:34,567 --> 01:26:36,663
I'm bringing them together in ink,

1033
01:26:36,687 --> 01:26:38,992
along with what I've learned
and the paths I've taken.

1034
01:26:40,830 --> 01:26:45,150
This will be the ultimate novel!
I'm pouring my soul into it.

1035
01:26:45,507 --> 01:26:48,021
And you're still not finished with it?

1036
01:26:48,758 --> 01:26:52,778
When I'm finished with this,
everything will be finished.

1037
01:26:53,489 --> 01:26:56,169
When I find someone to inherit my will...

1038
01:26:56,566 --> 01:26:59,939
and I feel I've properly passed it on...

1039
01:27:00,674 --> 01:27:02,074
Well...heh.

1040
01:27:02,463 --> 01:27:04,536
I guess I'm not
even close to finishing it.

1041
01:27:06,510 --> 01:27:11,643
All this, "inherit your will" talk...
It's just making me confused.

1042
01:27:12,764 --> 01:27:14,484
<i>One to inherit my will...</i>

1043
01:27:15,565 --> 01:27:17,094
<i>Perhaps that would be...</i>

1044
01:27:17,886 --> 01:27:19,379
Hm? What?

1045
01:27:20,087 --> 01:27:20,767
Hmph!

1046
01:27:21,250 --> 01:27:24,450
At any rate, I suppose
that's enough writing for now.

1047
01:27:25,010 --> 01:27:26,210
Next up...

1048
01:27:27,452 --> 01:27:28,839
Time to start training, huh?

1049
01:27:29,018 --> 01:27:31,489
Time to get to the
mixed bathing hot spring

1050
01:27:31,568 --> 01:27:34,146
to find some material for the
next installment of my Make-Out series!

1051
01:27:35,268 --> 01:27:36,155
Hey!

1052
01:27:36,344 --> 01:27:37,864
I thought you'd say "training"!

1053
01:27:37,889 --> 01:27:39,654
You're still hung up on this
mushy "Make-Out" material!

1054
01:27:40,706 --> 01:27:43,686
Watch your tongue, boy! This sacred
writing is nothing to make light of!

1055
01:27:43,711 --> 01:27:46,131
How about some training already!

1056
01:27:46,515 --> 01:27:49,615
Enough! I am in charge, and I
will spar with you some other time!

1057
01:27:49,681 --> 01:27:53,241
That's what you said last time!
And the time before that!

1058
01:27:53,301 --> 01:27:54,207
So long sucker!

1059
01:27:54,272 --> 01:27:56,066
Making me wait again?!

1060
01:28:26,278 --> 01:28:28,363
Umm, Sakura. Got a minute?

1061
01:28:29,529 --> 01:28:30,529
Ino?

1062
01:28:31,113 --> 01:28:33,032
Sure. What's up?

1063
01:28:34,158 --> 01:28:37,954
As, as it happens,
I've been thinking about things...

1064
01:28:39,249 --> 01:28:41,376
And it became totally clear to me
on this mission.

1065
01:28:42,217 --> 01:28:44,553
Clear that I'm be no good at all
at this rate!

1066
01:28:46,295 --> 01:28:47,295
Ino.

1067
01:28:47,870 --> 01:28:50,372
It's frustrating,
and I was envious of you.

1068
01:28:51,342 --> 01:28:52,969
You, who everyone depended on.

1069
01:28:53,719 --> 01:28:56,973
So, please.
I also want to become a Medical Ninja.

1070
01:28:58,213 --> 01:28:59,423
I know it'll be hard.

1071
01:28:59,978 --> 01:29:03,732
But I've got guts and I'll manage
the studying, no matter what.

1072
01:29:04,397 --> 01:29:06,899
So could you ask Lady Tsunade for me?

1073
01:29:07,777 --> 01:29:09,779
- Sure.
- Really?!

1074
01:29:09,946 --> 01:29:11,447
But prepare yourself.

1075
01:29:11,941 --> 01:29:15,110
Once that happens,
you'll be my little sister protege.

1076
01:29:15,410 --> 01:29:16,953
What's that...?

1077
01:29:17,156 --> 01:29:18,407
Naturally!

1078
01:29:18,536 --> 01:29:24,500
After all, I'll be your
Medical Ninja superior, you know.

1079
01:29:26,004 --> 01:29:28,173
Man, I can't wait.

1080
01:29:28,396 --> 01:29:30,231
You'll be my lovable
little sister protege.

1081
01:29:30,339 --> 01:29:32,174
I'll train you nice and hard.

1082
01:29:32,842 --> 01:29:35,845
Just you watch!
I'll pass you up right away!

1083
01:29:36,284 --> 01:29:38,587
Ha! Try it if you can!
Ino pig!

1084
01:29:38,612 --> 01:29:41,163
I'll do it! Billboard Brow!

1085
01:29:45,730 --> 01:29:48,024
Why?! Why is it?!

1086
01:29:48,274 --> 01:29:49,394
What are you talking about?!

1087
01:29:49,442 --> 01:29:53,529
Why was I the only one left out
of the mission the other day?!

1088
01:29:53,696 --> 01:29:57,575
But you were with
a different team then, right?

1089
01:29:57,700 --> 01:30:00,119
But everyone had taken part!

1090
01:30:00,702 --> 01:30:02,360
She's kind of in a rage.

1091
01:30:02,744 --> 01:30:05,663
It's hard being the only one left out
of a mission.

1092
01:30:06,375 --> 01:30:07,960
Come to think of it,

1093
01:30:08,210 --> 01:30:10,129
it seems Naruto's finally leaving
for training.

1094
01:30:11,297 --> 01:30:14,717
I heard. It seems that Jiraiya
is going to be his mentor.

1095
01:30:15,051 --> 01:30:18,304
Damn it! That guy's going
to get stronger again.

1096
01:30:20,170 --> 01:30:23,131
It looks like the village will
get quiet for a while.

1097
01:30:23,559 --> 01:30:27,271
When you put it that way,
it's a little bit sad, isn't it?

1098
01:30:27,923 --> 01:30:30,425
No! This isn't the time
to be getting sad!

1099
01:30:31,734 --> 01:30:32,902
I must work hard!

1100
01:30:33,235 --> 01:30:34,904
Several times more,
several times more.

1101
01:30:35,697 --> 01:30:38,241
If I don't work hard hundreds
of times harder than Naruto,

1102
01:30:38,373 --> 01:30:41,376
I won't be able to face him
the next time we meet.

1103
01:30:41,911 --> 01:30:43,245
Your guard is off!

1104
01:30:48,751 --> 01:30:52,588
We also must grow by that time.

1105
01:30:53,339 --> 01:30:56,676
It's because trying to improve
by learning from others,

1106
01:30:56,701 --> 01:30:59,037
that is what's called friendship.

1107
01:30:59,428 --> 01:31:02,682
Good grief,
we'd better not lose, Akamaru.

1108
01:31:03,933 --> 01:31:04,934
Same here!

1109
01:31:05,497 --> 01:31:07,332
Hey, you okay, Lee?!

1110
01:31:07,357 --> 01:31:09,484
I'm fine, I'm fine.

1111
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:24,996
Lady Hinata, let's call it a day.

1112
01:31:25,162 --> 01:31:26,455
What? I'm still...

1113
01:31:27,999 --> 01:31:30,292
It's about time for his departure.

1114
01:31:30,793 --> 01:31:31,444
Oh!

1115
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:33,430
You won't be able to
see him for a while.

1116
01:31:36,549 --> 01:31:40,219
I see...It looks like you'll be
on a long journey...

1117
01:31:40,386 --> 01:31:41,386
Yeah!

1118
01:31:45,474 --> 01:31:48,477
Listen up.
Be sure to train and don't goof off.

1119
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:50,879
Right! You can count on me!

1120
01:31:55,401 --> 01:31:57,319
It's about time to go, Naruto.

1121
01:31:57,766 --> 01:31:58,508
Right!

1122
01:32:04,285 --> 01:32:06,621
Okay! I'm off, Iruka Sensei!

1123
01:32:06,885 --> 01:32:09,205
I'll pay you back for the ramen
once I've become a success.

1124
01:32:09,999 --> 01:32:11,167
Jeez...

1125
01:32:20,163 --> 01:32:21,957
<i>Good luck, Naruto.</i>

1126
01:32:35,775 --> 01:32:36,775
Keep your eyes on me.

1127
01:32:43,866 --> 01:32:46,535
What're you doing?!
I'll leave you behind, Naruto.

1128
01:32:47,036 --> 01:32:50,081
Hey. H-Hey, wait up!

1129
01:32:56,754 --> 01:33:00,382
<i>I also have to work hard in order
to catch up with Naruto.</i>

1130
01:34:57,094 --> 01:35:01,223
I just have to work hard and
carve out a future for myself.

1131
01:35:01,658 --> 01:35:04,160
And I must not run away
from my path of solitude.

1132
01:35:05,382 --> 01:35:06,884
If I do that, someday...

1133
01:35:06,909 --> 01:35:08,813
I can be like him.

1134
01:35:10,834 --> 01:35:13,808
So as a shinobi
who belongs to the Sand,

1135
01:35:13,833 --> 01:35:15,559
I will aim to become the Kazekage.

1136
01:35:16,066 --> 01:35:18,902
In order to connect with
this village and live in it.

1137
01:35:19,475 --> 01:35:20,601
Gaara...

1138
01:35:22,117 --> 01:35:24,703
Watching Naruto Uzumaki
makes me feel this way.

1139
01:35:25,542 --> 01:35:27,252
A connection with others...

1140
01:35:27,642 --> 01:35:31,980
Until now, that only meant hatred
and a desire to kill.

1141
01:35:32,910 --> 01:35:37,873
So just what is this connection
that he keeps talking about?

1142
01:35:38,460 --> 01:35:41,797
After all this time, I understand
a little bit about something...

1143
01:35:44,933 --> 01:35:47,936
Suffering and sadness...
even happiness...

1144
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:52,298
can be shared with someone.

1145
01:35:53,555 --> 01:35:55,099
Naruto Uzumaki...

1146
01:35:55,831 --> 01:35:58,500
He has known
the same suffering I have...

1147
01:35:58,969 --> 01:36:00,704
And he has taught me

1148
01:36:00,729 --> 01:36:03,399
that it is possible to
change one's path in life...

1149
01:36:04,149 --> 01:36:08,612
I, too, want to become the kind of man
that everyone looks up to...

1150
01:36:09,613 --> 01:36:11,907
Instead of just being
a weapon to be fearful of.

1151
01:36:13,075 --> 01:36:15,411
As the Kazekage of the Hidden Sand.
