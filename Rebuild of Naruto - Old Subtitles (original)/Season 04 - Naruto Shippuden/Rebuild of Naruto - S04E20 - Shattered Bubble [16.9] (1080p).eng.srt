1
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:24,774
<i>Say, that boy...</i>

2
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,112
<i>He's the one. The only one
who failed to make it!</i>

3
00:00:29,762 --> 00:00:31,645
<i>Humph! Good for him!</i>

4
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:34,753
<i>It would be terrible if someone
like him became a ninja.</i>

5
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:36,202
<i>I mean that boy is actually...</i>

6
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,413
<i>Don't say another word.
It's taboo.</i>

7
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:46,262
<i>Damn! What's with all this?!</i>

8
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:29,816
Good thing I took extra measures,
just in case.

9
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,253
<i>They haven't returned yet.</i>

10
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,315
Naruto?

11
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,435
Why you...!

12
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,254
Wait, Naruto! Stop!

13
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:01,806
No, Captain Yamato!
Let me just say this!

14
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,225
Old man Tonbei!

15
00:03:04,398 --> 00:03:08,902
You knew the forbidden jutsu was
embedded into Hotaru's back, didn't you?!

16
00:03:12,906 --> 00:03:14,074
<i>Answer me!</i>

17
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,280
The forbidden jutsu is in that girl?

18
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,331
Friends of the Hidden Leaf...

19
00:03:26,784 --> 00:03:29,559
Please stop!
It was my grandfather.

20
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,921
You served Hotaru's grandfather
all through the years, didn't you?

21
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,506
So why didn't you stop him?!

22
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,634
Please stop, Naruto!

23
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,844
No, I won't stop!

24
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,363
Because of that...
Because of that, you're...

25
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,765
I asked that it be done!

26
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:50,104
What did you say?

27
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,692
I...I asked for the forbidden jutsu!

28
00:03:56,065 --> 00:03:57,066
Lady Hotaru...

29
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:04,277
Hotaru...Why do such a thing?

30
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,051
Tonbei...I'm glad you're all right.

31
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,138
I should say that about you,
Lady Hotaru.

32
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:29,185
Friends of the Hidden Leaf...
Sir Utakata...

33
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,313
I am beholden to you
for all you have done for us.

34
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:34,649
Don't mention it.

35
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:38,653
But the Tsuchigumo Village was already
under the bandit's control.

36
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,198
I see...And that is why
you returned here...

37
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:43,908
Yes.

38
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,535
Never mind that.

39
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,704
Tell us the rest of what
you were saying earlier!

40
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,290
About the forbidden jutsu?

41
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,125
Yeah.

42
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:56,212
It was Grandfather's dream.

43
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,423
En no Gyoja's...?

44
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:05,422
The Tsuchigumo Clan was once
hailed as a proud clan.

45
00:05:05,447 --> 00:05:07,181
By possessing
a powerful forbidden jutsu,

46
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:10,601
we were said to even be able to tilt
the balance of the Great Ninja War.

47
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:14,147
But at the same time,

48
00:05:14,538 --> 00:05:17,583
our clan was targeted often
because of the forbidden jutsu.

49
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:20,695
And one life after another was lost.

50
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,740
When the Great War was over,

51
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:27,535
only a few remained who could
wield the forbidden jutsu.

52
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:30,513
Furthermore, Lord En no Gyoja and

53
00:05:30,543 --> 00:05:35,382
the village elder had disagreements
over the clan's survival.

54
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,171
This led to the clan splitting
into two groups

55
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:43,343
with one in the Tsuchigumo Village
and the other at Mount Katsuragi.

56
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:49,307
However, Lord En no Gyoja was
already quite advanced in years

57
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:53,519
and few opted to follow him
to Mount Katsuragi.

58
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,482
<i>Hotaru...I'm counting on you.</i>

59
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,655
<i>The future of the Tsuchigumo Clan...</i>

60
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:17,543
<i>Grandfather!</i>

61
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:24,675
Grandfather believed that
protecting the Tsuchigumo name

62
00:06:25,056 --> 00:06:28,471
was the way to make amends and

63
00:06:28,812 --> 00:06:31,682
honor those who lost their lives
for the forbidden jutsu.

64
00:06:34,588 --> 00:06:39,315
That is why I want to carry on the wish
of my grandfather, who was my master.

65
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:41,715
How stupid.

66
00:06:45,117 --> 00:06:47,870
Just for that you had the forbidden jutsu
embedded in your body?

67
00:06:49,555 --> 00:06:52,600
For your master, for your clan...
It's all so stupid.

68
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,874
Even so, it's a student's duty to
carry out the wishes of her master!

69
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,440
Hotaru...

70
00:07:03,784 --> 00:07:07,496
You wouldn't understand...
Master Utakata...how I feel.

71
00:07:08,722 --> 00:07:12,684
Lady Hotaru,
perhaps Sir Utakata is right.

72
00:07:13,728 --> 00:07:14,729
Tonbei?

73
00:07:16,065 --> 00:07:19,760
It is evident that the Tsuchigumo
Clan no longer has the strength

74
00:07:19,785 --> 00:07:21,704
to safeguard the forbidden jutsu.

75
00:07:22,592 --> 00:07:24,635
If we allowed the misuse
of the forbidden jutsu,

76
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:28,406
Lord En no Gyoja would
surely turn in his grave.

77
00:07:28,905 --> 00:07:30,824
To prevent its misuse,

78
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:34,436
we have no choice
but to destroy the jutsu.

79
00:07:35,471 --> 00:07:36,472
Destroy?

80
00:07:37,968 --> 00:07:39,886
And how would you do that?!

81
00:07:40,109 --> 00:07:43,613
The forbidden jutsu is
inside Hotaru's body!

82
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:45,506
You don't mean...!

83
00:07:45,711 --> 00:07:47,130
Don't get me wrong.

84
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:52,446
Mr. Tonbei...
You mustn't move too much.

85
00:07:52,596 --> 00:07:54,181
Do not be concerned.

86
00:08:06,522 --> 00:08:07,564
What is this?

87
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:12,183
Lord En no Gyoja entrusted me
with that scroll.

88
00:08:13,544 --> 00:08:19,476
It contains the way to remove the
forbidden jutsu from Lady Hotaru's body.

89
00:08:20,296 --> 00:08:22,506
Is there such a method?

90
00:08:23,071 --> 00:08:27,159
Lord En no Gyoja would never have
embedded the forbidden jutsu

91
00:08:27,455 --> 00:08:31,501
into Lady Hotaru without
a way to remove it.

92
00:08:31,688 --> 00:08:34,816
What kind of master would
even think of such a thing?

93
00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:38,742
Please forgive me.

94
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,312
I should have advised you sooner.

95
00:08:42,234 --> 00:08:44,862
Once it is removed from your body,

96
00:08:44,887 --> 00:08:47,557
the forbidden jutsu will
no longer have any power.

97
00:08:49,369 --> 00:08:52,623
I also longed to restore
the clan's former glory.

98
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,285
Without the forbidden jutsu,
that dream would fade.

99
00:08:57,061 --> 00:08:59,438
But this is how it should be.

100
00:09:00,126 --> 00:09:01,127
You can't be serious!

101
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:03,409
Friends of the Hidden Leaf...

102
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,754
Please help me remove
the forbidden jutsu from Lady Hotaru.

103
00:09:07,357 --> 00:09:11,277
However, we cannot make
such decisions on our own.

104
00:09:11,428 --> 00:09:14,722
Then hurry up and get
Granny Tsunade's permission.

105
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,005
We can't just leave Hotaru like this!

106
00:09:17,383 --> 00:09:18,551
Please wait!

107
00:09:18,802 --> 00:09:22,014
I haven't decided to let go
of the forbidden jutsu yet!

108
00:09:22,264 --> 00:09:23,849
But Lady Hotaru...

109
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:26,518
Not only the forbidden jutsu,

110
00:09:26,665 --> 00:09:28,980
but also your life would be in peril!

111
00:09:29,005 --> 00:09:30,840
It's my life!

112
00:09:38,188 --> 00:09:39,481
Come to your senses!

113
00:09:40,877 --> 00:09:42,003
Sir Utakata...

114
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,544
I-I'm sorry.

115
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:51,919
Are you telling me to abandon
my clan pride and honor?!

116
00:09:53,495 --> 00:09:54,496
Hey, wait!

117
00:09:54,521 --> 00:09:55,522
Naruto!

118
00:09:57,268 --> 00:09:58,353
I'll bring her back!

119
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,434
Lady Hotaru...

120
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,436
I'll go and convince her.

121
00:10:04,267 --> 00:10:05,393
Hold on, please!

122
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,356
We cannot let you move around.

123
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:11,235
She can't have gone far.
I'll be right back.

124
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,113
I won't put Hotaru in danger.

125
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:18,367
All right. Sakura, go with him!

126
00:10:18,853 --> 00:10:19,575
Yes, sir.

127
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,205
I'd be better at scouting her out.

128
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,959
There's something I want you
to do right now.

129
00:10:27,318 --> 00:10:27,974
Yes, sir.

130
00:10:37,508 --> 00:10:38,509
Grandfather...

131
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,768
<i>Hotaru...take a look.</i>

132
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:49,899
<i>Once, the Tsuchigumo clan was
known far beyond those mountains,</i>

133
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,611
<i>and all one could see from here
was part of our lands.</i>

134
00:10:54,222 --> 00:10:57,267
<i>Our clan was so grand, wasn't it?</i>

135
00:11:00,178 --> 00:11:02,680
<i>Are you crying? Grandfather...</i>

136
00:11:04,087 --> 00:11:06,965
<i>Was I wrong?</i>

137
00:11:07,435 --> 00:11:11,689
<i>If I had not been the leader,
would the Tsuchigumo Clan...?</i>

138
00:11:21,811 --> 00:11:25,023
So your grandfather's grave is here?

139
00:11:25,743 --> 00:11:27,119
I picked those near by.

140
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,147
Thank you, Naruto.

141
00:11:31,181 --> 00:11:33,142
With a view like this,

142
00:11:33,205 --> 00:11:35,207
your grandpa must be very happy
to be buried here.

143
00:11:40,243 --> 00:11:43,329
I'm sure he's worried about you.

144
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,914
He's right. Let's go back, Hotaru.

145
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,001
Sir Utakata.

146
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,107
Well? Let's go.

147
00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:03,311
But I...

148
00:12:04,122 --> 00:12:06,875
If you truly wish to restore
your clan's glory,

149
00:12:07,782 --> 00:12:09,618
you don't need to rely
on such a thing.

150
00:12:10,976 --> 00:12:15,314
Having too much power only
gives rise to suffering.

151
00:12:16,324 --> 00:12:18,743
There's still one other way.

152
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,489
Another way?

153
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:25,046
There is someone named Shiranami
among the Tsuchigumo Clan...

154
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:28,742
who is able to use
the forbidden jutsu.

155
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,753
Who's Shiranami?

156
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,794
He is grandfather's student.

157
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,880
En no Gyoja's student?

158
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:40,611
Well, more correctly,
he is the student's student.

159
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:47,226
Sir Shiranami's father, Sir Hato,
was my grandfather's first student.

160
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:53,230
I have heard that he was brilliant
with exceptional ninjutsu skills.

161
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:59,904
And it was said that his son,
Sir Shiranami, was even more skilled.

162
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:05,520
But during the Great War,
Sir Shiranami's father was killed

163
00:13:05,545 --> 00:13:07,964
trying to protect the forbidden jutsu.

164
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:12,833
Grandfather sensed that
Sir Shiranami was also in danger

165
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,543
and had him flee the village.

166
00:13:15,499 --> 00:13:20,963
Grandfather often said that
if those two were here now,

167
00:13:21,349 --> 00:13:24,477
this village would not be
in such dire straits.

168
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:30,726
So where is this Shiranami fellow now?

169
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,061
You know of anything?

170
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,979
Well...

171
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:38,230
There's no telling when
the bandits will return.

172
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:40,961
We have no time to look for Shiranami.

173
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,780
Make up your mind, Hotaru.

174
00:13:46,456 --> 00:13:50,376
All right then! I'll go and
find this Shiranami!

175
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,123
What are you talking about?!

176
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,751
Actually...Hotaru...

177
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:59,271
I'm sorta in the same dilemma as you.

178
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:00,840
You too, Naruto?

179
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,133
Naruto...that's...

180
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,811
I can't go into detail,
but deep down,

181
00:14:08,836 --> 00:14:12,048
I've always been troubled by it.

182
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:17,481
Anyway, I can be like this now
because people like Sakura,

183
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:20,776
the Pervy Sage and all the rest
of my friends have stayed by me.

184
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,029
But Hotaru, you're awfully strong.

185
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:28,492
You accepted those troubles
and you've suffered all alone.

186
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:34,164
Carrying your clan and
your grandpa's dream on your shoulders.

187
00:14:36,761 --> 00:14:40,390
That's why I want you to
fulfill your dream.

188
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:45,759
If this Shiranami fellow is found,
he'll be an ally, right?

189
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,409
Then you won't be alone.

190
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,891
And you don't have to suffer
by yourself.

191
00:14:52,594 --> 00:14:53,595
Naruto...

192
00:14:54,598 --> 00:14:56,308
Now don't worry.

193
00:14:56,478 --> 00:15:00,107
Just leave it to me, Naruto Uzumaki.

194
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,779
Give me one...no, two days.

195
00:15:06,158 --> 00:15:08,452
I'll find Shiranami without fail.

196
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,539
<i>What a surprise.</i>

197
00:15:20,758 --> 00:15:24,303
<i>I never would've guessed my name
would be mentioned here.</i>

198
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,609
It's pretty much what I imagined.

199
00:15:50,315 --> 00:15:51,525
What will you do?

200
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,370
It will be dangerous to keep
the forbidden jutsu intact.

201
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,960
But it says here they want to
keep the forbidden jutsu

202
00:15:58,985 --> 00:16:01,446
and guard the girl at the Leaf village.

203
00:16:03,156 --> 00:16:05,691
Without a doubt, it's necessary
to keep the forbidden jutsu

204
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:08,561
from falling into
a third party's possession.

205
00:16:12,451 --> 00:16:16,247
Cripes...I acted like finding the guy
was no big deal for me,

206
00:16:16,272 --> 00:16:17,690
but where do I start looking?

207
00:16:18,276 --> 00:16:20,320
Well, it's no use thinking about it.

208
00:16:20,345 --> 00:16:22,472
This calls for the strength
in numbers approach!

209
00:16:23,392 --> 00:16:25,352
<i>Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

210
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:31,949
<i>Naruto is...?</i>

211
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:35,833
Indeed, if Shiranami returns
to the village, we could...

212
00:16:36,183 --> 00:16:38,269
Can he find him in only two days?

213
00:16:39,055 --> 00:16:42,350
We may not be able to wait
that long.

214
00:16:42,828 --> 00:16:46,582
If the bandits attack again
before Naruto returns...

215
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:48,465
You're right...

216
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:51,218
Just in case, we'll make preparations

217
00:16:51,304 --> 00:16:53,848
and stand by to purge
the forbidden jutsu.

218
00:16:55,008 --> 00:16:56,217
You understand, Hotaru?

219
00:16:57,551 --> 00:16:58,552
Yes.

220
00:16:59,471 --> 00:17:03,308
It looks like the Diremption Jutsu
requires potions.

221
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:06,291
Sakura, you'll be in charge.

222
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,859
Mix the potion and be ready.

223
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:09,229
Understood.

224
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:24,977
<i>Lord En no Gyoja would never
have embedded the forbidden jutsu</i>

225
00:17:25,063 --> 00:17:28,859
<i>into Lady Hotaru without
a way to remove it.</i>

226
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:32,303
<i>What kind of master would
even think of such a thing?</i>

227
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,559
<i>M-Master...?!</i>

228
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,356
<i>No, Utakata! He didn't...</i>

229
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,112
<i>Harusame didn't try to kill you.
It wasn't like that.</i>

230
00:17:54,425 --> 00:17:57,762
<i>Could it be...
that Tsurugi spoke the truth?</i>

231
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:02,398
<i>If so, then what was
Master trying to tell me?</i>

232
00:18:03,887 --> 00:18:06,264
<i>I must speak to Tsurugi once more.</i>

233
00:18:14,203 --> 00:18:17,206
Say, ever heard of a guy
named Shiranami?

234
00:18:19,962 --> 00:18:22,548
Do you know a guy
named Shiranami?

235
00:18:24,926 --> 00:18:26,469
I see...Don't know him, huh?

236
00:18:27,536 --> 00:18:28,745
Anything you know?

237
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,321
If you find out, tell me,
Naruto of the Hidden Leaf!

238
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,496
It's no use...

239
00:18:43,383 --> 00:18:47,036
I've used up my chakra and
I don't even have a clue.

240
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,111
What's the matter?

241
00:18:50,381 --> 00:18:52,216
Standing in the middle
of the road like this.

242
00:18:52,751 --> 00:18:56,529
Well...I'm looking for someone
and just can't seem to find him.

243
00:18:56,843 --> 00:18:59,012
Hmm...Who might that be?

244
00:18:59,482 --> 00:19:01,874
A guy named Shiranami.

245
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,900
Shiranami...

246
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:05,936
Oh, there is such a man.

247
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:06,937
No kidding!

248
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,590
Is that true?!
Are you sure about this, old man?!

249
00:19:10,223 --> 00:19:15,103
Yes. There's a man by that name
who lives in a small hut

250
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:19,741
by the waterfall beyond this mountain,
and does ninja training.

251
00:19:19,976 --> 00:19:23,230
Beyond this mountain, right?!
Thanks, old man!

252
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,872
Found him!

253
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:39,887
That must be it.

254
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,556
I've finally found you.

255
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,017
<i>Hold tight, Hotaru.</i>

256
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,436
<i>I'm coming back with
Shiranami right now!</i>

257
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:02,993
Mister...Shiranami?

258
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,454
I found you.

259
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:06,955
Are you Shiranami?

260
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,160
You fell for it.

261
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,973
<i>How could you leave without a word?</i>

262
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,392
<i>Sir Utakata, I still...</i>

263
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:37,444
I take it that you are Lady Hotaru
the granddaughter of En no Gyoja?

264
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:38,987
Wh-Who are you?!

265
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,158
My name is...Shiranami.

266
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:44,952
Shiranami?!

267
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,286
<i>Release!</i>

268
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,999
We finally meet, Lady Hotaru.

269
00:20:52,714 --> 00:20:53,605
That's...

270
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,299
That crest is bestowed only
to those initiated

271
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,218
in the use of the forbidden jutsu.

272
00:21:02,004 --> 00:21:04,548
Can you really be...Sir Shiranami?

273
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,095
I don't blame you for being surprised.

274
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:10,394
I came after hearing Naruto's story.

275
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,229
Naruto?!

276
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,940
Then you really
are Sir Shiranami!

277
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:19,069
Where is Naruto? I must thank him...

278
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,240
He's no longer here.

279
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:27,494
He asked me to take care
of the rest, and left.

280
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,665
I see...Naruto too...

281
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:36,920
Naruto told me that...
you wanted to revive the clan.

282
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,339
Huh? Oh...yes.

283
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,425
If you are truly serious,

284
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:44,303
then could you listen to
what I have to say?

285
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:46,847
Sir Shiranami?

286
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,521
I'm told Tonbei is alive and well...

287
00:21:55,391 --> 00:21:56,850
and that he's planning to use

288
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,919
the Diremption Jutsu to destroy
the forbidden jutsu.

289
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,485
You know Tonbei too?

290
00:22:01,093 --> 00:22:02,887
We trained together for a time.

291
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:07,008
However, I am opposed to
Tonbei's intentions.

292
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,551
Why?

293
00:22:09,007 --> 00:22:12,844
Long ago...my father
was ordered by Lord En no Gyoja

294
00:22:12,869 --> 00:22:15,038
to guard the forbidden jutsu.

295
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:19,421
My father was a hero who protected
the honor of the Tsuchigumo clan

296
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,423
along with the forbidden jutsu.

297
00:22:24,548 --> 00:22:27,500
That is, until he was killed by one
who was after the forbidden jutsu.

298
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,768
My father's death motivated
Lord En no Gyoja

299
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:35,771
to move the forbidden jutsu to
the fort on Mount Katsuragi,

300
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,814
and he let me escape out
of the country.

301
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,276
I promised myself that one day,

302
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:44,738
I would return to the village for
the sake of the Tsuchigumo Clan!

303
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,157
Sir Shiranami...

304
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:49,242
Lady Hotaru.

305
00:22:49,514 --> 00:22:52,851
My father was killed and
I was forced to run away

306
00:22:53,082 --> 00:22:57,920
because we were the only two survivors
who knew how to use the forbidden jutsu.

307
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,588
<i>He went through the same anguish...</i>

308
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:05,008
But I've become strong
and now I'm back.

309
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:09,346
If we join forces,
we can revive the forbidden jutsu!

310
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,724
There is no need to destroy
the forbidden jutsu!

311
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:16,645
The restoration of the Tsuchigumo Clan
is my dedicated wish too!

312
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,732
Let us fulfill the dreams of my father
and Lord En no Gyoja!

313
00:23:23,996 --> 00:23:24,776
But...

314
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:29,366
Beyond this mountain is
my secret hideaway.

315
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:31,326
Lady Hotaru!

316
00:23:35,994 --> 00:23:36,954
I understand.

317
00:23:38,674 --> 00:23:39,801
Is that for Tonbei?

318
00:23:40,296 --> 00:23:43,757
Huh? Oh, yes...
I must let him know.

319
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:47,801
<i>At least a short note to Sir Utakata...</i>

320
00:23:55,691 --> 00:23:56,692
Off you go...

321
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,271
Let's go, Sir Shiranami.

322
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,400
You're making this difficult...

323
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:04,484
What?

324
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:06,589
Go.

325
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:07,980
Huh?

326
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:09,908
What's...?

327
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:13,410
If you do as you please...!

328
00:24:17,597 --> 00:24:20,183
<i>I thought I had come
to terms with it...</i>

329
00:24:20,743 --> 00:24:22,995
<i>So why am I thinking
about my master now?</i>

330
00:24:24,735 --> 00:24:25,736
What is that?

331
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,316
A word manipulated by chakra?

332
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,065
A carrier pigeon?

333
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,487
From Hotaru?!

334
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,573
<i>To Sir Utakata,</i>

335
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:56,661
<i>I will work to revive the Tsuchigumo Clan
with Sir Shiranami.</i>

336
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:00,373
<i>Thank you for all you have done.</i>

337
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,751
<i>Good-bye.</i>

338
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,462
<i>From your student, Hotaru.</i>

339
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,298
Hotaru...

340
00:25:11,226 --> 00:25:12,686
<i>So she met up with Shiranami...</i>

341
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,765
<i>That means I'm finally free of her.</i>

342
00:25:26,265 --> 00:25:27,767
Who are you guys?!

343
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,439
Don't tell me you have Shiranami--!

344
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,864
What a simpleton.

345
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,492
He's concerned about
Boss Shiranami.

346
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,268
If we let you see the girl
with the forbidden jutsu,

347
00:25:39,293 --> 00:25:41,712
all our plans will be ruined.

348
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:44,125
You're telling too much.

349
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,503
No need to worry.

350
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:49,089
This is Boss' special barrier,

351
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,841
which takes away an enemy's chakra!

352
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,970
It's just not possible for anyone
inside the barrier to resist.

353
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:56,125
Wh-What?!

354
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:58,139
D-Damn you...!

355
00:25:58,723 --> 00:25:59,350
Get him!

356
00:26:07,502 --> 00:26:09,212
He's...strong.

357
00:26:09,811 --> 00:26:10,770
Don't panic!

358
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,154
Just stick to the Boss' strategy
and use the next jutsu!

359
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,366
<i>Multi-Mugenhouyo!</i>

360
00:26:23,284 --> 00:26:25,119
Let's see you free yourself
from this...

361
00:26:26,056 --> 00:26:26,704
What?!

362
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,838
This is...

363
00:26:30,702 --> 00:26:32,954
nothing!

364
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:33,905
Damn...

365
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:47,606
I can't believe he can still move
after losing so much chakra!

366
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:49,858
No time to be impressed.

367
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,693
Let's get this over with!

368
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:56,406
What is it?

369
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,079
You're...

370
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,835
I couldn't help but overhear
what you said.

371
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:12,005
So the leader of the bandits
is Shiranami.

372
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:16,051
Where the hell did you
take Hotaru to?!

373
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:22,766
Wh-What's with this guy?

374
00:27:23,143 --> 00:27:24,645
This is bad, Akaboshi.

375
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,896
The Boss should be
in the village by now.

376
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:29,397
Time for us to go too!

377
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:30,523
- Right!
- Right!

378
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,827
This is...the village
of the Tsuchigumo Clan?

379
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,664
Are you awake, Lady Hotaru?

380
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,509
Sir...Shiranami?

381
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,419
Come on out, everyone.

382
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,797
Lady Hotaru has come home.

383
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:58,927
These people are...

384
00:27:59,963 --> 00:28:02,048
Did something happen
to the villagers?

385
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:06,636
I used a jutsu to make them
obedient, that's all.

386
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:07,435
What?!

387
00:28:07,724 --> 00:28:13,063
I had no choice. It's all for the sake
of getting the forbidden jutsu.

388
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:17,028
Sir Shiranami! Did you trick me?!

389
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:20,448
I didn't trick you.
What I told you earlier is true.

390
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:22,701
Although I should add
that my old man,

391
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:26,538
who died protecting the forbidden jutsu,
was actually killed by me!

392
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,041
I killed my old man after trying

393
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,210
to take the forbidden jutsu
from him!

394
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:33,962
Lady Hotaru!

395
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:40,635
It's useless.
You're already under my jutsu.

396
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,222
The forbidden jutsu...

397
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:48,326
The forbidden jutsu is finally
within my grasp!

398
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,440
It's just a dried up branch.

399
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,359
Rather than tracking
the soil like that,

400
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,487
wouldn't it be faster if I just used
my Multi-Shadow Clones?

401
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:04,117
And destroy any trace left of Hotaru?

402
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,662
<i>Looking at this imprint...</i>

403
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,205
<i>There's no doubt about it.</i>

404
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:12,167
<i>These are footprints of someone who
was carrying a body under his arm.</i>

405
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,418
This way.

406
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,044
Hey! You're sure?

407
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:18,298
Every search begins by analyzing
all traces that are left behind.

408
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,133
That's one of the basic rules for a ninja.

409
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:23,428
For someone who boasts
about their master,

410
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,556
neither you nor Hotaru received adequate
training from your masters, have you?

411
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,767
That's not true!

412
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:36,691
Seriously...That's what happens
when you're obsessed

413
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,777
over something as stupid as masters.

414
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:42,030
H-Hey! Hold on there!

415
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,783
There's nothing stupid about it!

416
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:03,968
Hotaru is gone?

417
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:07,680
I searched around the entire fort.

418
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:13,812
I did relay Naruto's message
that he "found Shiranami."

419
00:30:15,108 --> 00:30:18,653
<i>She went after Utakata...
Could that be it?</i>

420
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:22,170
All right, we'll postpone
the ritual preparations for now.

421
00:30:22,598 --> 00:30:24,641
Finding Hotaru is our top priority.

422
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:28,643
Sai, send out as many
search mice as possible.

423
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:30,169
Let's go.

424
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:31,376
Yes, sir.

425
00:30:31,879 --> 00:30:33,714
<i>Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll!</i>

426
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,919
I learned all sorts of things from
the Pervy Sage.

427
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,338
Taijutsu...ninjutsu...
That goes without saying.

428
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,798
I mean, really great jutsu.

429
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:45,093
But he wasn't just strict...

430
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,929
He also taught me what's most important
about being a ninja...

431
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,347
The guts to never give up.

432
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:57,272
What I received from my master
was valuable.

433
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,065
It wasn't stupid or useless.

434
00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:01,375
You had a master too, didn't you?

435
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:05,989
<i>Memories of my master...</i>

436
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,201
<i>Mission accomplished!</i>

437
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:14,539
<i>Ninja must perform their missions swiftly.</i>

438
00:31:15,002 --> 00:31:16,253
<i>Right, Master?</i>

439
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,556
<i>You fool!</i>

440
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,586
<i>Huh?!</i>

441
00:31:20,019 --> 00:31:23,523
<i>Your mission was to track
the stolen scroll!</i>

442
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:26,450
<i>Who said to bring it back?!</i>

443
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:30,680
<i>Your life is precious!
Do not waste your life!</i>

444
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:35,643
<i>A ninja never runs away from
a battle that must be fought.</i>

445
00:31:35,856 --> 00:31:39,777
<i>However, a ninja never fights
an unnecessary battle!</i>

446
00:31:42,096 --> 00:31:42,879
<i>Still...</i>

447
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:47,822
<i>I'm glad that you are all right.</i>

448
00:31:49,264 --> 00:31:50,265
<i>Master...</i>

449
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:54,982
<i>He cared for me...
That's what I thought.</i>

450
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,874
<i>It wasn't me he cared about...</i>

451
00:31:58,952 --> 00:32:00,620
<i>but the "power" inside me.</i>

452
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:08,009
<i>He merely saw me as its vessel.</i>

453
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:12,096
<i>But...if what Tsurugi said is true...</i>

454
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:16,267
Hey! Is this it?!

455
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,353
Huh? Oh, yeah...

456
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:28,154
Hey, this is the village of
the Tsuchigumo Clan!

457
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,447
It is?

458
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:33,034
But the tracks all led to this place.

459
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:34,827
I wonder if something happened?

460
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:38,915
The bandits attacked Hotaru here.

461
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:40,027
And...

462
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:46,005
And the villagers here didn't
think highly of Hotaru.

463
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:51,511
The fact that the forbidden jutsu was
shunned in this village is pretty obvious.

464
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:52,959
Yeah.

465
00:32:53,465 --> 00:32:56,114
And if Hotaru was attacked
right in this village...

466
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,352
The bandits and the village
are connected,

467
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,437
or the village just turned
a blind eye to it.

468
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:06,567
In any case, the bandits are using
this village as their hideout.

469
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:10,279
Also, the footprints that
were left behind...

470
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,156
They just don't seem natural.

471
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:16,619
Maybe he became overconfident
after he got the forbidden jutsu...

472
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:20,248
Or maybe he's planning to ambush us.

473
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:21,752
You mean, a trap?!

474
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:26,462
I'm not sure. But tracking them
has gone too smoothly.

475
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:29,173
"Beware when the chase
seems too easy."

476
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,174
That is what my master...

477
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,927
Anyway, let's be careful.

478
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:34,554
Yeah.

479
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:38,157
Seems you did learn stuff
from your master.

480
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,980
After we rescue Hotaru,
you should teach her some of that.

481
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,357
Let's go!

482
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,282
H-Huh?

483
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,076
Are you sure this is the place?

484
00:33:57,813 --> 00:33:59,189
I think so.

485
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,552
Thank you.

486
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:15,636
Sure.

487
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:17,889
Just for that, here!

488
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,106
What's going on?!

489
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,109
Here they come.

490
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,281
What? These guys...

491
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,076
They've joined up with the bandits
to come after us?

492
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:39,452
But...

493
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:43,331
Yeah, this is different.
They're being manipulated.

494
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:44,160
What?!

495
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:49,212
How dirty...

496
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,048
Here they come!

497
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:06,851
Damn!

498
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:19,033
We can't proceed any further
without hurting the villagers.

499
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:22,411
So, what do you suggest we do?!

500
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,292
What happened to
your earlier enthusiasm?

501
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,002
It's hopeless, eh?

502
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:33,422
Those guys are controlling
the villagers...

503
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:36,801
Get 'em, guys! Don't give 'em
a moment's rest!

504
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:45,782
What?

505
00:35:55,622 --> 00:35:56,311
Sai!

506
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:05,621
Captain Yamato!

507
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:07,456
Naruto!

508
00:36:08,484 --> 00:36:09,485
Sakura!

509
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,503
Naruto!

510
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,135
You idiot! Stop going off
on your own like that!

511
00:36:19,512 --> 00:36:21,683
I-I'm sorry...
But how come you're here?

512
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,556
We were looking for Lady Hotaru,

513
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,266
who had disappeared from
Mount Katsuragi.

514
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:27,351
We had Sai push himself.

515
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,813
I'm really not cut out
for physical labor.

516
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:33,733
I didn't expect to use
so much chakra.

517
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,276
Here, have a food pill.

518
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,153
I'll have one later.

519
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:39,405
What are you talking about?

520
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:42,408
What if something happens to you?

521
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:46,329
It's my special food pill.
So get energized!

522
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:49,665
<i>You know, that thing tastes awful...</i>

523
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,196
Stop fraternizing!

524
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,058
Shoot!

525
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,440
We won't let you go past here.

526
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:17,360
You can't interfere with the Boss' ritual.

527
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:28,996
<i>Wordbind Jutsu.</i>

528
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:38,464
My years of painstaking preparation
are about to pay off.

529
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:43,052
Your heart must also be rejoicing over
the forbidden jutsu's release.

530
00:37:47,593 --> 00:37:48,594
What is this?!

531
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:50,851
Sai! Sakura!

532
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:58,734
Captain Yamato!

533
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,530
<i>Wood Style!</i>

534
00:38:14,369 --> 00:38:15,495
Captain Yamato!

535
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:17,878
You two, go on ahead!

536
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:21,098
But!

537
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,676
Leave this to us, Naruto!

538
00:38:24,057 --> 00:38:25,266
Go, Naruto!

539
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,430
You must save Hotaru!

540
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:31,958
Guys, I'm counting on you!

541
00:38:38,068 --> 00:38:42,572
No wonder it was useless looking
for the forbidden jutsu.

542
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:48,784
He had used his own granddaughter
as its hiding place.

543
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:55,249
That En no Gyoja...

544
00:38:55,368 --> 00:38:57,537
What a cruel thing to do.

545
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:01,797
If the forbidden jutsu is removed
from its human vessel,

546
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,091
it would become lost forever.

547
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:09,930
And unless the human who became
its vessel is skilled enough to control it,

548
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,850
the forbidden jutsu cannot be activated...

549
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:18,522
So even if someone were to come
after the forbidden jutsu,

550
00:39:18,691 --> 00:39:20,693
they cannot lay a hand on it.

551
00:39:21,716 --> 00:39:26,054
En no Gyoja's kindness has protected it.

552
00:39:26,442 --> 00:39:29,611
However, if it stays this way,
the treasure will be wasted.

553
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:37,293
Right now, you are no more than
a storage tank accumulating natural energy.

554
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,960
You have yet to wield the
activation jutsu necessary to

555
00:39:39,985 --> 00:39:43,655
set off that collected natural energy.

556
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:46,425
And then I come along...

557
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:51,472
The sole survivor of the Tsuchigumo Clan
who has mastered that jutsu.

558
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:54,725
What a lucky turn of events, right Hotaru?

559
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,728
The jutsu which will restore the clan
to its glory

560
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,123
is on the verge of
seeing the light of day.

561
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:06,237
Let's use it to give a scare to those
who denounced our clan.

562
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:11,659
What is it, Hotaru?
Aren't you happy?

563
00:40:14,594 --> 00:40:18,641
Then laugh. Come on.

564
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,676
I see.

565
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:28,050
You're happy too? You should be.

566
00:40:28,075 --> 00:40:29,785
You should be.

567
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:42,626
<i>Tsuchigumo Style:
Forbidden Jutsu Release!</i>

568
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:44,986
<i>Big Bang!</i>

569
00:41:22,029 --> 00:41:23,322
It's coming...It's coming...

570
00:41:24,072 --> 00:41:26,324
Now, the trump card
to our clan's revival...

571
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:27,693
The moment is here...

572
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:30,637
The forbidden jutsu shall awaken
after its decade-long seal!

573
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,451
Gather chakra!

574
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:38,996
Overflow in Hotaru's body,
which serves as the vessel!

575
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:42,082
And manifest your formidable power!

576
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,060
Utakata! What are you doing?!

577
00:42:03,004 --> 00:42:04,714
Chakra is flowing...

578
00:42:05,202 --> 00:42:06,203
Chakra?

579
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,278
I don't see anything.

580
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:15,157
It is probably chakra that exists
within the atmosphere and terrain.

581
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:26,591
What is this?

582
00:42:27,155 --> 00:42:28,990
They're riding the chakra,

583
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:32,160
the chakra's current,
towards a certain location.

584
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,083
And Hotaru is...

585
00:42:34,838 --> 00:42:35,839
She's there?!

586
00:42:36,536 --> 00:42:37,537
Let's go!

587
00:42:39,343 --> 00:42:40,427
Right!

588
00:42:45,954 --> 00:42:48,332
Why is the chakra gathering there?

589
00:42:50,756 --> 00:42:53,604
Hey, you're sure Hotaru will be there?

590
00:42:54,009 --> 00:42:56,971
If you have time to talk,
then get moving.

591
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,251
<i>Hotaru...</i>

592
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,005
Over there!

593
00:43:11,404 --> 00:43:12,405
All right!

594
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:25,436
Hotaru!

595
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,441
We're too late...

596
00:43:30,949 --> 00:43:33,827
Useless bunch.

597
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:37,031
Couldn't they at least hold you off
a little longer?

598
00:43:40,601 --> 00:43:44,021
Oh well, I don't mind having
an audience.

599
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,457
You bastard!

600
00:43:46,837 --> 00:43:48,338
What did you do to Hotaru?!

601
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:50,628
<i>Sir Utakata...</i>

602
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,255
Hotaru's dream...

603
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:56,759
I'm just helping her to realize it.

604
00:43:57,419 --> 00:43:59,547
The revival of the Tsuchigumo Clan.

605
00:44:00,053 --> 00:44:01,763
And the key to that is

606
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:05,480
activating the forbidden jutsu
with my abilities.

607
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:10,189
Your ability? What do you mean?

608
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:14,276
She doesn't have the skill to
activate the forbidden jutsu yet.

609
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:17,640
She's only able to accumulate
the chakra in nature.

610
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:24,078
So I'll activate it for her,
from the outside.

611
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:28,874
In order to restore the tarnished honor
of the Tsuchigumo Clan.

612
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:32,711
What honor?! All you're trying to do
is steal Hotaru's feelings

613
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:35,923
for her grandfather, Tonbei,
and her people.

614
00:44:36,211 --> 00:44:38,797
Everything that Hotaru holds dear!

615
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,390
Who needs something
as cheap as feelings?

616
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:46,725
I'm going to steal the world.

617
00:44:47,328 --> 00:44:48,223
What?!

618
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:52,439
As long as I have this, be it
the five Kage's or the Lords...

619
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:55,359
No one will be able to ignore me.

620
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:56,902
A new village...

621
00:44:56,944 --> 00:45:02,449
No, I can even attain lands
superior to the Five Great Nations.

622
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,230
Are you out of your mind?!

623
00:45:04,663 --> 00:45:06,373
I've never been more serious.

624
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:10,457
Now that I've come this far,
I can take on the Five Great Nations.

625
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:12,126
With this forbidden jutsu,

626
00:45:12,151 --> 00:45:14,654
taking over the world is
not just a dream!

627
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,630
I knew it!

628
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:21,885
You don't give a damn...
about the people of the Tsuchigumo Clan!

629
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,346
Yeah...that goes without saying.

630
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:27,933
What about...
What about Hotaru's feelings?!

631
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:30,018
As if I care.

632
00:45:30,279 --> 00:45:32,156
She put her faith in you...

633
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:35,566
A carved seal of that magnitude
was embedded into her...

634
00:45:35,779 --> 00:45:38,365
and she protected that
forbidden jutsu with all her might...

635
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:40,350
for the sake of her people.

636
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,865
And she entrusted you with it.

637
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:45,075
Huh?

638
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:55,002
It's true that I killed my own father
in order to satisfy my greed.

639
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:59,923
But you're not one to talk.
I know all about you.

640
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:03,552
You're listed in the Bingo Book,
aren't you?

641
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:06,980
You're a rogue ninja from
the Hidden Mist, right?

642
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,559
You turned your back on
the Hidden Mist.

643
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:13,532
I don't need to be lectured
by someone...

644
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:16,190
who doesn't care about his village!

645
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:27,217
I can tell we're alike, you and I.
We smell the same!

646
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:30,804
Did I hit it right on the mark?

647
00:46:34,028 --> 00:46:35,988
Well, whatever.

648
00:46:36,404 --> 00:46:40,167
But since Hotaru is
so attached to her people,

649
00:46:40,691 --> 00:46:44,487
I'm willing to name my new nation
after the Tsuchigumo.

650
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:47,821
I'm not a bandit, after all.

651
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:49,932
Thinking of the land of my birth,

652
00:46:50,056 --> 00:46:52,267
I'm helping to bring it back to glory.

653
00:46:52,292 --> 00:46:54,377
I'd say I'm a pretty fine person!

654
00:46:54,577 --> 00:46:55,662
Don't kid around!

655
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:59,441
You're right.
Maybe I don't give a damn...

656
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:01,777
about my village...

657
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:02,986
Utakata...

658
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:04,947
But what will happen to Hotaru?

659
00:47:06,222 --> 00:47:11,019
She'll live. As the ultimate weapon
for the forbidden jutsu.

660
00:47:11,492 --> 00:47:13,702
I will control this great jutsu...

661
00:47:15,059 --> 00:47:16,853
and she will be my tool.

662
00:47:17,239 --> 00:47:20,913
Tool...Did you say "tool"?!

663
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:22,798
Yes...

664
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,333
My tool!

665
00:47:26,862 --> 00:47:28,290
Shut up!

666
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:50,409
Too bad. You can't oppose me anymore.

667
00:47:50,957 --> 00:47:52,375
Just like Hotaru.

668
00:47:59,545 --> 00:48:01,464
Good...More...

669
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:04,339
Let your body overflow with chakra!

670
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:10,512
Now then, what shall
I make you do?

671
00:48:11,844 --> 00:48:16,890
How about making comrades
fight each other?

672
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:22,733
<i>I can't move...</i>

673
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,777
Or maybe bodyguards?

674
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:29,197
You can guard my tool.

675
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:30,908
Why you...

676
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:41,668
Don't think you can get near
my tool so easily.

677
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:46,173
Don't call her your tool...

678
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:50,093
Hotaru is not a tool!

679
00:48:50,638 --> 00:48:52,973
Don't talk. You're irritating.

680
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:01,897
Forget it.

681
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:04,733
You have no grounds to object.

682
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:10,948
Hotaru chose me.
She chose to become the vessel.

683
00:49:37,949 --> 00:49:39,242
<i>To Sir Utakata,</i>

684
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:42,562
<i>I will work to revive the Tsuchigumo Clan
with Sir Shiranami.</i>

685
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:46,566
<i>Thank you for all you have done.</i>

686
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:54,324
<i>Good-bye...
From your student, Hotaru.</i>

687
00:50:02,182 --> 00:50:06,102
Hotaru doesn't want
to be rescued by you.

688
00:50:06,572 --> 00:50:10,910
So stay there and watch as the Tsuchigumo
village disappears in an instant.

689
00:50:11,867 --> 00:50:14,745
<i>Sir Utakata. I'm so sorry.</i>

690
00:50:15,373 --> 00:50:18,334
<i>It's all because I was so foolish...</i>

691
00:50:25,831 --> 00:50:29,687
Hmm...You still have the will to resist.

692
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:34,865
<i>Sir Utakata.</i>

693
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,056
Damn it!

694
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:45,725
Just a little more...Just a little more
and Hotaru's vessel will be full of chakra.

695
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:50,797
You will be my witnesses to
the resurrection of the forbidden jutsu.

696
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:11,359
There's no way we can put up
a fight against those four like this.

697
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:14,738
First, we have to stop the villagers.

698
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,073
But how?

699
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,784
It can't be helped if we get
a bit rough with them.

700
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,078
We'll isolate them all in one place.

701
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:26,958
I'm sorry!

702
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:28,794
I have to get a little rough.

703
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:31,254
Cha!

704
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:42,891
<i>Super Beast Scroll!</i>

705
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:04,162
<i>Wood Style: Four Pillar House Jutsu!</i>

706
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:09,709
We'll have them lay low there
for a while.

707
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:13,505
way to ruin our fun.

708
00:52:13,744 --> 00:52:16,872
We can't keep letting them
have their way.

709
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,386
That's our line.

710
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,346
I wonder about that.

711
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:35,902
It's no fun...without an audience.

712
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:44,244
Oh boy...
There's just no end to this, is there?

713
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:49,958
<i>Damn it...</i>

714
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:57,357
You're doing well, Hotaru.

715
00:52:57,591 --> 00:53:00,886
Our guests are probably
getting anxious.

716
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:10,395
Now surrender
your body and soul to me!

717
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:13,773
Unleash the chakra you've
accumulated all at once!

718
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:17,986
This place which rejected you...
Let's reduce it into ashes!

719
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,034
<i>Ninja Art...</i>

720
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:24,993
What?!

721
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,203
<i>Bubble Bomb!</i>

722
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,042
You blockhead!

723
00:53:32,956 --> 00:53:34,791
When did you set that up?

724
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:39,306
If you had behaved,
you could've lived a bit longer.

725
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,444
Why did my Wordbind Jutsu...?

726
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:00,987
These guys...

727
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:03,198
The amount of chakra is unnatural...

728
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:08,078
Like we'd let you control us so easily!

729
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:12,415
I won't let you!

730
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:17,504
<i>Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

731
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:20,799

You bastard!

735
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:43,029
Hotaru...

736
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,323
Are you all right, Hotaru?!

737
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:54,165
Hotaru!

738
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:58,295
What do we do?

739
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,632
Why you...You still wanna fight?

740
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,009
Whoa!

741
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:08,805
Have you forgotten that
my Wordbind Jutsu controls Hotaru?

742
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:14,602
Get back!

743
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:16,271
Damn!

744
00:55:16,507 --> 00:55:20,511
She isn't fully charged with
the chakra from nature, but...

745
00:55:24,442 --> 00:55:27,445
Now Hotaru...Let us show them.

746
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:30,660
How dreadful
the forbidden jutsu is!

747
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,967
Now let us start.

748
00:55:47,316 --> 00:55:48,013
<i>No.</i>

749
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:52,265
Let us show the world!

750
00:55:53,146 --> 00:55:54,480
Our...

751
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:57,937
No, my...power!

752
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,398
<i>No...No!</i>

753
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:02,734
Die!

754
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,486
<i>Fury Jutsu!</i>

755
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:08,448
<i>No!</i>

756
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:21,127
What's that?!

757
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:29,969
It looks like the Boss took possession
of the forbidden jutsu.

758
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:47,237
Take a look Hotaru,
isn't it magnificent?

759
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:49,697
This is the power of
the forbidden jutsu!

760
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:53,660
The art we honed together.

761
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:07,549
<i>No...</i>

762
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:10,635
<i>I couldn't have...</i>

763
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,263
<i>No...</i>

764
00:57:14,911 --> 00:57:17,122
No!

765
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:22,480
I...I...

766
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:26,443
killed Sir Utakata?

767
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:31,698
Oh, come on...

768
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:32,866
This is a problem...

769
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,161
I don't need a vessel
that comes with feelings.

770
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:42,834
Now then, once more.

771
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:44,961
This time, the Tsuchigumo village.

772
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:48,965
Those worthless villagers...

773
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,050
Incinerate them all!

774
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:53,928
<i>Wood Style Jutsu!</i>

775
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:56,639
It's useless!

776
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:06,566
Hah! You see?
You can't hurt the villagers.

777
00:58:07,063 --> 00:58:10,567
However, I couldn't care less
what happens to people like them!

778
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:12,489
This is the end!

779
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:23,666
We got them!

780
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,593
What?!

781
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:40,448
Benten?!

782
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:45,855
How did you guys...?!

783
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:47,982
Like this!

784
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:58,535
The jutsu created by the four of you
was quite formidable.

785
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:01,996
But with just two remaining,
you're no match for us.

786
00:59:10,768 --> 00:59:13,604
With this forbidden jutsu,
I'll conquer small nations

787
00:59:13,647 --> 00:59:15,774
and make the Five Great Nations tremble.

788
00:59:19,813 --> 00:59:22,316
N-Not likely...

789
00:59:25,756 --> 00:59:29,801
A-As if I'll let you have...
your way.

790
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:35,446
Utakata! This is no time
to be lying around!

791
00:59:37,615 --> 00:59:38,616
Yeah...

792
00:59:39,867 --> 00:59:42,537
We have to get Hotaru back.

793
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:45,498
Hmph! Don't know when to die,
do you?

794
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:48,668
Do you want another taste
of the forbidden jutsu?

795
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:50,670
Like I'll let you!

796
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:52,297
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

797
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,009
Go!

798
00:59:58,469 --> 00:59:59,512
Don't underestimate me!

799
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:01,973
<i>Wordbind Jutsu, Explode!</i>

800
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:07,353
Utakata! Get Hotaru now,
while there's a chance!

801
01:00:08,006 --> 01:00:09,049
I won't let you!

802
01:00:09,158 --> 01:00:10,534
<i>Wordbind Jutsu, Flame!</i>

803
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,446
What's the matter?

804
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:17,655
Is that all you have?

805
01:00:24,570 --> 01:00:25,571
No!

806
01:00:26,178 --> 01:00:27,763
You can't form seals now...

807
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:32,128
Hotaru!

808
01:00:32,469 --> 01:00:33,335
Damn it!

809
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,677
I'll pay you back tenfold!

810
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:42,469
Hotaru!

811
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:48,770
You...! You're activating
the forbidden jutsu again?!

812
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:50,563
It's not me!

813
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:56,069
Look at this...
My hands are bound!

814
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:58,571
Then what's going on here?!

815
01:00:59,556 --> 01:01:00,598
Who knows?

816
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:03,868
Maybe it's from absorbing
too much natural energy.

817
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:07,705
Stop it right now!

818
01:01:07,813 --> 01:01:10,065
And how am I supposed to do that
with my hands like this?

819
01:01:13,162 --> 01:01:13,916
<i>Release.</i>

820
01:01:16,502 --> 01:01:17,503
Now then...

821
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:27,600
Damn!

822
01:01:27,624 --> 01:01:29,293
Hey! Hurry up and stop it!

823
01:01:30,842 --> 01:01:32,969
<i>The Wordbind jutsu...isn't working.</i>

824
01:01:34,173 --> 01:01:35,174
<i>This is...</i>

825
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,031
What's wrong?

826
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:46,661
It's getting worse.

827
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:50,164
If it keeps accumulating
the chakra from nature like this,

828
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:52,709
it'll explode along with
the entire village.

829
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:54,794
What?!

830
01:01:57,171 --> 01:01:58,172
Hotaru...

831
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:02,844
Damn it...

832
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:05,763
The revival of the Tsuchigumo Clan...

833
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,224
The wishes of En no Gyoja...

834
01:02:08,399 --> 01:02:11,160
After being forced to take on
all the grown-ups' selfish desires,

835
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:13,691
Hotaru has finally lost it!

836
01:02:13,716 --> 01:02:17,403
Shut up! What the hell would
you know about Hotaru?!

837
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:21,446
All alone, she kept
the forbidden jutsu safe!

838
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:25,575
She happily offered herself for
the sake of restoring her clan.

839
01:02:26,372 --> 01:02:29,291
She shouldered the entire burden...
by herself.

840
01:02:30,654 --> 01:02:32,906
But then she met Utakata...

841
01:02:33,505 --> 01:02:36,758
And although you tricked her,
she met you, her senior.

842
01:02:38,273 --> 01:02:42,110
Hotaru...She was finally able
to find a comrade.

843
01:02:42,135 --> 01:02:44,471
People she could share a bond with.

844
01:02:44,945 --> 01:02:46,905
And you crushed it!

845
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:52,618
Comrade? Bond?
Don't give me that nonsense!

846
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:55,146
I'm the same as Hotaru.

847
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:57,231
For the sake of the forbidden jutsu,

848
01:02:57,256 --> 01:03:00,009
they would sacrifice their student,
their own son, without hesitation.

849
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:01,719
Saying it's what a ninja would do...

850
01:03:02,442 --> 01:03:04,068
That it's the only way to survive.

851
01:03:04,274 --> 01:03:06,527
I went through it all
until I got sick of it!

852
01:03:07,141 --> 01:03:08,976
That's why I went on the offensive.

853
01:03:09,298 --> 01:03:11,926
I killed my father,
who had been my master,

854
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:14,040
and I tried to steal
the forbidden jutsu.

855
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:15,166
What?!

856
01:03:16,778 --> 01:03:18,613
And you over there...

857
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:20,755
Didn't you basically
do the same thing?

858
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:24,091
I...I...

859
01:03:25,901 --> 01:03:26,902
You're wrong.

860
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:28,429
Huh?

861
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:33,351
My master always...
thinks about his student...

862
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:35,102
About me.

863
01:03:35,825 --> 01:03:39,269
No matter how far apart we are...
I can always feel his thoughts.

864
01:03:39,734 --> 01:03:42,529
He's in my heart every single minute!

865
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:44,542
That's why I can believe in him.

866
01:03:45,532 --> 01:03:48,993
Hotaru also has
her grandfather and Tonbei.

867
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:53,246
And Utakata...Your feelings should
have reached her too!

868
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:55,414
It exists deep inside her heart!

869
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:59,794
Even now, she yearns for her comrade,
for her master...

870
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:02,042
for her bond!

871
01:04:02,446 --> 01:04:04,322
You don't know anything about her!

872
01:04:05,243 --> 01:04:06,536
Don't talk like you do!

873
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:07,969
Dream on!

874
01:04:08,086 --> 01:04:09,838
<i>Wordbind Jutsu! Split!</i>

875
01:04:14,541 --> 01:04:15,542
Naruto!

876
01:04:16,463 --> 01:04:17,464
Thanks...

877
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:24,868
Shoot...For now, I'd better fall back
before the vessel explodes!

878
01:04:33,304 --> 01:04:34,044
Hotaru!

879
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:41,294
I'll bring Shiranami back.

880
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:42,879
- I'm coming...
- No!

881
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:45,256
You're Hotaru's master.

882
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:47,425
Stay with her.

883
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:49,969
I'm counting on you!

884
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:51,262
Got it!

885
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:07,737
<i>Hotaru also has
her grandfather and Tonbei.</i>

886
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:11,866
<i>And Utakata...Your feelings should
have reached her too!</i>

887
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:15,828
<i>My feelings...are within her!</i>

888
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:19,332
<i>As well as within my heart...</i>

889
01:05:24,211 --> 01:05:25,212
<i>That's right...</i>

890
01:05:25,771 --> 01:05:28,566
<i>My anger had closed off my ears.</i>

891
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:31,552
<i>But I did hear...</i>

892
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:35,973
<i>No, I did feel...
my master's thoughts.</i>

893
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,686
It was there.
My master's thoughts...

894
01:05:41,928 --> 01:05:43,180
They reached me, and yet...

895
01:05:45,316 --> 01:05:46,400
<i>Utakata...</i>

896
01:05:47,292 --> 01:05:50,420
<i>Live...side by side with this power.</i>

897
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:56,077
I had sworn never to use
your power again.

898
01:05:56,416 --> 01:06:00,295
But I beg you, help me,
for Hotaru's sake!

899
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:57,680
<i>Hotaru...</i>

900
01:06:59,345 --> 01:07:01,222
<i>I didn't want to hurt anybody...</i>

901
01:07:01,661 --> 01:07:02,912
<i>And yet...</i>

902
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:08,274
<i>I hurt Naruto and Sir Utakata!</i>

903
01:07:09,483 --> 01:07:13,195
<i>I'm right here.
Naruto and I are both alive.</i>

904
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:23,664
<i>I...</i>

905
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:25,708
<i>Hotaru?</i>

906
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:30,129
<i>I...I betrayed you, Sir Utakata.</i>

907
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:34,884
<i>Someone like me should disappear
along with this jutsu!</i>

908
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:36,401
<i>No!</i>

909
01:07:37,483 --> 01:07:38,817
<i>I will not allow that.</i>

910
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:44,852
<i>A student should listen
to her master!</i>

911
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:49,315
<i>You said...Master...</i>

912
01:07:50,649 --> 01:07:53,611
<i>We're going home, Hotaru.</i>

913
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:10,878
<i>What's wrong?</i>

914
01:08:11,545 --> 01:08:12,546
<i>No!</i>

915
01:08:12,571 --> 01:08:14,615
<i>No...Sir Utakata...</i>

916
01:08:15,652 --> 01:08:18,947
<i>Please get away from me!
Please run!</i>

917
01:08:19,303 --> 01:08:20,304
<i>Hotaru!</i>

918
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:24,391
<i>I cannot suppress it any longer...</i>

919
01:08:25,219 --> 01:08:29,098
<i>The forbidden jutsu is going
to tear me apart...and explode.</i>

920
01:08:30,672 --> 01:08:31,673
<i>It's all right.</i>

921
01:08:33,010 --> 01:08:34,136
<i>Sir Utakata...</i>

922
01:08:34,946 --> 01:08:36,280
<i>Believe in your master.</i>

923
01:08:50,275 --> 01:08:53,111
So be it, destroy this entire village!

924
01:08:53,562 --> 01:08:55,397
Eradicate everything!

925
01:09:01,762 --> 01:09:02,763
Damn it!

926
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:05,141
<i>Multi...</i>

927
01:09:05,182 --> 01:09:06,600
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

928
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:11,063
Persistent bastard!

929
01:09:11,605 --> 01:09:13,941
<i>Wordbind Jutsu, Flame!</i>

930
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:26,996
Fool! I'm going through!

931
01:09:33,917 --> 01:09:36,920
I'm not going to forgive you,
no matter what!

932
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:38,299
<i>Wordbind Jutsu!</i>

933
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:39,592
<i>Slice!</i>

934
01:09:39,717 --> 01:09:41,093
<i>Rasengan!</i>

935
01:09:43,387 --> 01:09:44,388
What?!

936
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:53,147
I've gotta take him to
Hotaru right away!

937
01:09:57,401 --> 01:09:58,402
What is that?

938
01:10:15,499 --> 01:10:16,500
Hey!

939
01:10:16,809 --> 01:10:17,810
Utakata!

940
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,051
Are you all right?

941
01:10:22,343 --> 01:10:23,344
Yeah...

942
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:35,606
Master...

943
01:10:37,376 --> 01:10:39,104
What a troublesome student you are.

944
01:10:39,713 --> 01:10:42,090
By the way, what happened
to the forbidden jutsu?

945
01:10:42,533 --> 01:10:44,409
It seems to have disappeared.

946
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:48,905
Disappeared? But Hotaru's safe, right?
That's a relief.

947
01:10:48,930 --> 01:10:49,931
Naruto...

948
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:52,748
Sakura!

949
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:07,930
Well then, the mission negotiated
between the Tsuchigumo Clan

950
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:10,849
and the Hidden Leaf has been
successfully completed.

951
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:13,894
Thank you for everything.

952
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:16,105
The forbidden jutsu is no more.

953
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:17,690
However...

954
01:11:17,998 --> 01:11:20,083
Yes. I think it was for the better.

955
01:11:20,773 --> 01:11:23,859
Now Lady Hotaru will no longer
be targeted.

956
01:11:24,577 --> 01:11:28,873
And the villagers will accept Hotaru
without reservations.

957
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:30,619
But now...

958
01:11:30,791 --> 01:11:33,711
Are you going, after all?
With Utakata?

959
01:11:34,832 --> 01:11:38,627
I still have much more to learn.

960
01:11:38,988 --> 01:11:42,242
After I have trained with
my master and become a ninja

961
01:11:42,267 --> 01:11:45,395
strong enough to help restore
the Tsuchigumo Clan,

962
01:11:45,509 --> 01:11:47,052
I promise to return to this village.

963
01:11:50,488 --> 01:11:52,365
Good for you, "Master"!

964
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:55,144
Are you toying with me?

965
01:11:55,908 --> 01:12:01,025
No, I'm happy that you've finally
accepted your role as a master.

966
01:12:03,190 --> 01:12:05,109
Take care of Hotaru.

967
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,699
Well, everyone, take care.

968
01:12:16,287 --> 01:12:18,789
It's nice, after all...
Having a master.

969
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:19,710
Hmm?

970
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:23,380
Now I kinda...
miss the Pervy Sage too!

971
01:12:33,512 --> 01:12:36,515
This is where I first met you, Master.

972
01:12:40,174 --> 01:12:43,511
Hotaru...Will you wait here
for just a while?

973
01:12:44,735 --> 01:12:45,861
Is something the matter?

974
01:12:46,653 --> 01:12:49,073
I'm going to meet with
the ANBU Black Ops from the Hidden Mist.

975
01:12:49,114 --> 01:12:50,574
I'm done running.

976
01:12:50,988 --> 01:12:53,240
I'm going to get their permission
to travel and train you.

977
01:12:54,864 --> 01:12:55,865
Yes, sir!

978
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:04,989
No response, after all.

979
01:13:05,694 --> 01:13:08,004
Did something happen to Tsurugi
and his men?

980
01:13:21,086 --> 01:13:23,129
The Six Tails' Jinchuriki…

981
01:13:24,089 --> 01:13:26,994
Are you the ones…
who killed Tsurugi and the others?

982
01:13:27,909 --> 01:13:29,694
I'm going to build a new world.

983
01:13:30,355 --> 01:13:32,565
And for that, I need you.

984
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:36,662
Rather, I need the Tailed-Beast
inside you.

985
01:13:36,990 --> 01:13:38,241
So that's it.

986
01:13:38,869 --> 01:13:40,907
I'm taking you…Six-Tails.

987
01:14:05,607 --> 01:14:07,568
Finally, you're taking this seriously.

988
01:14:13,022 --> 01:14:15,525
Now that's the power we seek…

989
01:14:27,862 --> 01:14:29,113
<i>Summoning Jutsu…</i>

990
01:14:33,427 --> 01:14:34,147
Go!

991
01:15:01,984 --> 01:15:03,277
It's been captured.

992
01:15:33,213 --> 01:15:36,050
I expected as much out of you.

993
01:15:41,767 --> 01:15:43,602
Now come, Six-Tails!

994
01:16:57,237 --> 01:16:58,655
Hota...ru...

995
01:16:59,948 --> 01:17:03,327
You...must live...

996
01:19:45,754 --> 01:19:48,924
Sealing of the Six-Tails...
is done.

997
01:19:49,576 --> 01:19:52,704
It takes time when
there are five of us.

998
01:19:53,163 --> 01:19:56,374
There are two Tailed-Beasts left.

999
01:19:56,792 --> 01:20:00,754
Yes...I've sent Sasuke to go
and retrieve the Eight-Tails.

1000
01:20:02,672 --> 01:20:03,799
Can we trust him?

1001
01:20:05,146 --> 01:20:07,232
I can vouch for Sasuke.

1002
01:20:16,647 --> 01:20:17,940
Are you all right, Sasuke?

1003
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:20,190
Yeah...Let's hurry.

1004
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:21,817
We're almost at
the rendezvous point.

1005
01:20:25,612 --> 01:20:28,114
As promised,
I brought the Eight-Tails.

1006
01:20:28,865 --> 01:20:32,494
You did well. I had faith
that you could do it.

1007
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:37,707
Where are you going?

1008
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:40,460
First, I'm going to tend
to my wounds.

1009
01:20:40,985 --> 01:20:41,986
Then...

1010
01:20:43,613 --> 01:20:44,740
I'm going to the Hidden Leaf.

1011
01:20:52,703 --> 01:20:54,871
I'm going to ask
one important question...

1012
01:20:55,725 --> 01:20:59,437
After learning about Itachi's life,
there is a chance

1013
01:20:59,479 --> 01:21:02,065
that you will carry out his wish
and protect the Hidden Leaf.

1014
01:21:02,987 --> 01:21:06,073
Tell me the truth.
What are your intentions?

1015
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:13,702
Itachi showed me how a man
would give his life to protect his village.

1016
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:17,581
But for me, the sadness
of losing Itachi

1017
01:21:17,814 --> 01:21:20,483
impacts me more deeply
than how he lived...

1018
01:21:21,042 --> 01:21:22,586
Unbearably more.

1019
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:26,965
The peace that Itachi sacrificed
himself for isn't appealing to me.

1020
01:21:27,616 --> 01:21:29,367
Now that I know the truth,

1021
01:21:29,509 --> 01:21:32,804
following in Itachi's steps to
protect the Hidden Leaf

1022
01:21:33,145 --> 01:21:35,314
is the last thing I would do.

1023
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:39,769
Most of all, I will never forgive
the three elders.

1024
01:21:40,186 --> 01:21:43,523
And I believe that everyone in
the Hidden Leaf enjoying the peace

1025
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:45,942
gained in exchange for
Itachi's life is guilty too.

1026
01:21:47,527 --> 01:21:50,113
I thought you were only going
to kill the elders?

1027
01:21:50,864 --> 01:21:54,910
No...I wish to slaughter
the entire Leaf Village by myself.

1028
01:21:55,493 --> 01:21:57,370
I was just feigning in front of Taka.

1029
01:21:58,335 --> 01:21:59,837
Is that the truth?

1030
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:04,085
After knowing just what Itachi
went through to protect the village...

1031
01:22:04,127 --> 01:22:06,838
Instead of carrying on his wish,
you'd destroy the village?

1032
01:22:07,207 --> 01:22:08,917
Are you serious?

1033
01:22:10,383 --> 01:22:12,010
You said so yourself.

1034
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:15,013
The reason why Itachi couldn't
bring himself to kill me was...

1035
01:22:15,546 --> 01:22:19,634
he cherished my life more
than the village.

1036
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:22,520
I feel the same way.

1037
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:26,566
Itachi's life is more precious
to me than the village.

1038
01:22:27,809 --> 01:22:28,976
That's all.

1039
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:33,448
They shunned the Uchiha clan.

1040
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:35,700
They forced my brother to
kill his own parents!

1041
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:38,703
The elders who cast him out
and sealed his death!

1042
01:22:39,537 --> 01:22:42,415
And the rest of the Hidden Leaf
who abide by the Senju clan!

1043
01:22:42,734 --> 01:22:44,694
They're nothing but scum!

1044
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:47,420
They are all objects of
my vengeance!

1045
01:22:51,466 --> 01:22:55,512
If you want to ridicule me as a brat
swayed by his emotions, go ahead.

1046
01:22:56,388 --> 01:22:59,599
Carrying on Itachi's wish are
merely pretty words.

1047
01:23:00,394 --> 01:23:03,105
The foolish sputtering of those
who don't know hatred.

1048
01:23:03,881 --> 01:23:07,176
If anyone criticizes my way of life,

1049
01:23:08,069 --> 01:23:11,614
I'll kill every single one
of their loved ones!

1050
01:23:12,990 --> 01:23:15,284
Then they might understand a little...

1051
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:22,205
