1
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:15,306
I treated your wounds.

2
00:00:26,145 --> 00:00:27,689
You won.

3
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:40,682
But you've sustained quite
a bit of damage as well.

4
00:00:41,983 --> 00:00:44,194
Try not to force yourself up.

5
00:00:56,531 --> 00:00:58,032
We've met once before.

6
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,269
The last time, it was as enemies.

7
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,814
Don't worry about Deidara's death...

8
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,275
I am not your enemy.

9
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:14,908
I brought you here in order to
tell you something.

10
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:22,310
You're not interested at all, I see...

11
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:27,212
Maybe if I put it another way,
you'll want to listen?

12
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,465
It is about Itachi Uchiha.

13
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:36,846
Yes...You think you know
about your brother,

14
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:38,331
but you know nothing.

15
00:01:42,203 --> 00:01:45,873
Oh, all right...
Let's start with introductions.

16
00:01:46,782 --> 00:01:51,287
Like you, I am a survivor
of the Uchiha Clan...

17
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,243
And the one who knows
the truth about Itachi Uchiha.

18
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,365
It can't be!

19
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,995
What was that just now?

20
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:03,892
The Amaterasu,
which Itachi implanted inside you.

21
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:19,908
How like Itachi. He surprises you
even after he's dead.

22
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,285
To think he planned things this far...

23
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,621
What are you talking about?

24
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:30,376
In order to kill me,
he placed a jutsu into you...

25
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:35,131
Or rather should I say;
in order to keep me away from you...

26
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:40,720
He probably set his Amaterasu
to self-activate

27
00:03:40,862 --> 00:03:44,824
when you look into my Sharingan.

28
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:52,139
<i>Even Itachi didn't know
everything about me...</i>

29
00:03:52,686 --> 00:03:55,023
<i>Otherwise I would be dead right now.</i>

30
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,821
So this was his fail-safe plan...

31
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,157
Although it didn't work on me.

32
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:04,787
So...what's this all about?

33
00:04:05,338 --> 00:04:09,008
Before he died, Itachi must've done
something to you.

34
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,758
At the end...for your sake,

35
00:04:18,783 --> 00:04:21,837
he transferred his own
ocular powers to you.

36
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:27,863
What are you saying?
Just...what are you trying to say?

37
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,270
Why would Itachi do
something like that?!

38
00:04:30,946 --> 00:04:32,448
Don't you get it?

39
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:40,113
In order to...protect you.

40
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,959
Protect?

41
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,661
Did you say protect?!

42
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,262
I'll say it once more...

43
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,280
You think you know about your brother,
but you know nothing.

44
00:04:54,868 --> 00:04:59,247
If you continue speaking
such nonsense, I'll kill you!

45
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:03,386
You're not making this easy, are you?

46
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,847
I suppose that's natural though...

47
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,851
Suddenly being told such a story
by a stranger like me.

48
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:14,506
But what I tell you is the truth.

49
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:18,860
Itachi did mention it, did he not?
About his accomplice that night.

50
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:25,462
I am that Madara Uchiha.

51
00:05:30,168 --> 00:05:32,253
I know everything about Itachi.

52
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:36,502
I suppose Itachi died
without realizing that.

53
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:41,341
Shut up!
Such things don't matter anymore!

54
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,343
Just get out of my sight!

55
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:47,764
No, you will listen.
You need to hear this.

56
00:05:48,546 --> 00:05:50,340
It's your obligation!

57
00:05:51,797 --> 00:05:53,465
For the sake of the ninja world...

58
00:05:53,869 --> 00:05:55,496
For the sake of
the Hidden Leaf Village...

59
00:05:55,811 --> 00:05:58,105
And for your sake...

60
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:02,343
Your brother risked everything.
You will know how Itachi Uchiha lived!

61
00:06:08,696 --> 00:06:09,822
Do you know why?

62
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:14,749
Why Itachi implanted Amaterasu
into your eye?

63
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,255
Itachi was determined to make sure
that you and I would not meet.

64
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,758
You will understand why,
as well as everything else,

65
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:24,909
when you hear me out.

66
00:06:28,898 --> 00:06:31,192
Those who knew the truth about Itachi

67
00:06:31,217 --> 00:06:33,970
were Danzo of the Hidden Leaf,
the Third Hokage,

68
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:38,606
and his advisors Homura and Koharu.
Just those four.

69
00:06:39,894 --> 00:06:44,356
The Third Hokage died...
and now, there are only three aging folk.

70
00:06:46,163 --> 00:06:51,293
Still, those three will probably
never reveal the abominable truth.

71
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,480
The truth about Itachi will fade
into darkness forever.

72
00:06:55,505 --> 00:06:58,299
And that is what Itachi wished.

73
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,676
However, I know the truth
about Itachi too.

74
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,709
As I said earlier...
Itachi died without realizing that.

75
00:07:13,996 --> 00:07:15,998
However, he wanted to
make doubly sure.

76
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:19,147
It seems Itachi did not trust me.

77
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:23,276
So just in case I did know the truth,

78
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:26,513
he planned to silence me
with the Amaterasu.

79
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:30,908
He probably anticipated I would show
my Sharingan

80
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:32,601
in order to speak to you.

81
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,122
What is this?

82
00:07:38,737 --> 00:07:40,697
What is this guy saying?

83
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,673
Protect me?

84
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,216
Protect?!

85
00:07:48,145 --> 00:07:50,230
The truth?

86
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:55,516
Think back.

87
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:02,023
Think carefully and
remember about Itachi.

88
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,289
About your kind brother.

89
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,925
No, he...

90
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,261
He tried to kill me!

91
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,347
He tried to take my eyes...

92
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,103
<i>Who would do such a thing?!</i>

93
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,149
<i>Foolish little brother...</i>

94
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,984
<i>Mangekyo Sharingan!</i>

95
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,585
Calm down!

96
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,214
Breathe slowly.

97
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:09,809
Don't touch me!

98
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:21,062
<i>Even if you do hate me...</i>

99
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,938
<i>That's what big brothers are for.</i>

100
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,904
<i>Sorry, Sasuke...Another time.</i>

101
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:54,677
You're awake...

102
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,347
Sorry, but I took the liberty
of tying you up.

103
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:01,559
Since you weren't gonna stay still
and listen to me.

104
00:10:02,627 --> 00:10:05,963
He...Itachi was my enemy.

105
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:10,985
He killed our parents...
He killed everyone in the clan.

106
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,905
He was a rogue ninja...
A member of the Akatsuki...

107
00:10:16,107 --> 00:10:18,610
He was despicable.

108
00:10:19,742 --> 00:10:21,076
He was my target.

109
00:10:21,885 --> 00:10:23,345
It's true...

110
00:10:23,487 --> 00:10:27,032
that he annihilated
the Uchiha clan that night.

111
00:10:27,318 --> 00:10:29,111
And he deserted the Hidden Leaf.

112
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:31,797
Then...

113
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,584
And that is what he was ordered
to do by the Hidden Leaf.

114
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:42,266
That is the beginning of
the truth about Itachi.

115
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,644
It was his mission?

116
00:10:45,684 --> 00:10:46,685
Yes.

117
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:50,983
That night, Itachi killed his personal
feelings and fulfilled his mission.

118
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,199
It seems you've calmed down a bit.

119
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,409
What are you talking about?!

120
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,497
In order to talk about Itachi,

121
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:08,501
I must take you back to the early days
when Hidden Leaf Village was founded.

122
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,463
Itachi sacrificed himself.

123
00:11:13,308 --> 00:11:15,393
This is fate that has continued
since ages past.

124
00:11:16,554 --> 00:11:17,972
He was sacrificed for it.

125
00:11:18,527 --> 00:11:23,657
A huge problem rooted since the time
Hidden Leaf Village was founded.

126
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,686
That is what determined Itachi's life.

127
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:32,876
It's a long story,
but everything I tell you is the truth.

128
00:11:33,707 --> 00:11:36,043
On what basis should I believe you?

129
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,489
You're untrustworthy.

130
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:42,009
There's nothing I can show you
as proof.

131
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,496
And it's up to you whether
you believe me or not.

132
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:49,291
But you will hear me out until I finish.

133
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,547
Fine...So talk.

134
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,428
It all started more
than 80 years ago.

135
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:09,270
The world was in turmoil.
It was the age of war.

136
00:12:10,874 --> 00:12:15,713
Nations battled for power and
to increase their territories.

137
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,654
During this age of war,

138
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:22,891
ninja consisted of individual clans
serving as armed units.

139
00:12:23,315 --> 00:12:28,070
They were hired by various nations
to participate in the fighting.

140
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:36,378
And among the many ninja clans,
two were feared as the strongest.

141
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,593
One was us, the Uchiha clan.

142
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,888
And the other was known
as the Forest's Senju Clan.

143
00:12:45,113 --> 00:12:48,700
We of the Uchiha clan possessed
exceptional chakra and the Sharingan.

144
00:12:48,867 --> 00:12:53,788
Excelling in all types of warfare,
we became known as a battle clan.

145
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:58,819
And I was born into the Uchiha clan,

146
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:02,072
possessing chakra that
was especially powerful.

147
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:06,643
Perhaps the fact that I've lived
this long is proof of that.

148
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,706
Back in those days,
all I did was battle.

149
00:13:10,973 --> 00:13:12,892
In an age defined by power,

150
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:16,253
I sought to become ever stronger

151
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,964
and killed my friends and
even my younger brother.

152
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,675
Why you...!

153
00:13:22,161 --> 00:13:26,284
As a result, I came into possession
of the perfect Mangekyo Sharingan,

154
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:28,687
and became the leader of the Uchiha.

155
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:34,313
And using that power,
I fought the Senju clan countless times.

156
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:40,277
It was inevitable that I face Hashirama,
the leader of the Senju clan.

157
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:46,325
"Wood Style" Hashirama Senju,
the future first Hokage.

158
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,286
The one who stood at
the top of the ninja world...

159
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,914
And the one I respected most.

160
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,706
If the Senju moved,
so did the Uchiha.

161
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:59,630
Our clan was probably the only clan
able to compete with them.

162
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:04,134
If a nation hired the Senju, the
opposing nation would hire the Uchiha.

163
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,761
We were like rivals.

164
00:14:06,694 --> 00:14:08,527
The more I went up against Hashirama,

165
00:14:08,552 --> 00:14:10,805
the more my name became known
as well.

166
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,727
To heighten your reputation...

167
00:14:14,044 --> 00:14:16,839
You took your younger brother's eyes
just for that?!

168
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,233
I did take them.

169
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:25,155
But I needed power in order
to protect the Uchiha.

170
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,283
Protect?

171
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:32,162
Yes. As the Uchiha name spread,
its enemies increased.

172
00:14:33,637 --> 00:14:36,473
It was a necessary sacrifice
to protect the clan

173
00:14:36,498 --> 00:14:41,044
during the fierce fighting with the Senju,
and the other clans.

174
00:14:42,676 --> 00:14:44,386
It was not for my fame.

175
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,221
My younger brother was
in total agreement

176
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,932
and offered his eyes to me.

177
00:14:56,337 --> 00:15:01,675
But one day,
the Senju clan offered a truce.

178
00:15:03,635 --> 00:15:05,595
And the Uchiha accepted it.

179
00:15:06,423 --> 00:15:09,718
Everyone, in both clans,
had grown weary of the fighting

180
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:11,077
that had dragged on for so long.

181
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,871
They had enough.

182
00:15:15,753 --> 00:15:17,046
But I...

183
00:15:17,071 --> 00:15:20,199
I was the only one who opposed it.

184
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:25,007
Where has all the hate gone?!

185
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,886
For what purpose had my brother
sacrificed himself?!

186
00:15:35,771 --> 00:15:38,983
The Uchiha and Senju are
like oil and water.

187
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,649
I couldn't help fearing that in time,

188
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:45,511
the Uchiha clan would come to
be oppressed by the Senju clan.

189
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:54,330
However...everyone in the Uchiha clan
wanted a truce.

190
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:59,625
As their leader, I had no choice
but to go along with their wishes.

191
00:16:02,748 --> 00:16:07,789
Shortly thereafter, the ninja alliance
signed a pact with the Land of Fire,

192
00:16:07,814 --> 00:16:10,066
which had sought dominion
over the territories.

193
00:16:10,694 --> 00:16:15,198
The secure one nation, one village system
was formed

194
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:18,908
and became the Land of Fire and
the Village Hidden in the Leaves.

195
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:24,483
Other countries adopted
the one nation, one village system.

196
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:28,353
And subsequently,
the fires of war were extinguished.

197
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,739
Momentary peace.

198
00:16:31,762 --> 00:16:33,639
But due to a certain incident,

199
00:16:33,664 --> 00:16:35,792
the Hidden Leaf Village quickly
descended into turmoil.

200
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,706
A certain incident?

201
00:16:39,214 --> 00:16:43,635
A fight...for the First Hokage's seat.

202
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:49,008
As you know, the first to occupy
that seat was Hashirama Senju.

203
00:16:50,152 --> 00:16:52,946
The Land of Fire and
the entire clan chose Hashirama.

204
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:58,392
It was inevitable that the Uchiha's
hold on the reins of power would loosen.

205
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:04,314
I decided that the Uchiha
should take leadership...

206
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:08,193
That we should confront Hashirama...

207
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:13,323
But no one, not even from
the Uchiha clan, supported me.

208
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,745
My subordinates, who did not wish
to light the fires of war,

209
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,815
were unsympathetic and betrayed me.

210
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:26,805
I was accused of acting
out of greed and self-interest.

211
00:17:26,902 --> 00:17:28,070
Not only that...

212
00:17:28,284 --> 00:17:31,162
They scorned me as
a selfish brother

213
00:17:31,187 --> 00:17:33,773
who stole his younger brother's eyes
in order to save his own.

214
00:17:34,808 --> 00:17:38,103
What brother would willfully
hurt his younger brother?!

215
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:43,008
I just...I just wanted to
protect the Uchiha!

216
00:17:45,927 --> 00:17:47,470
I left the village.

217
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,210
Everyone betrayed me.

218
00:17:51,181 --> 00:17:56,520
I became an avenger and declared
war on the Hidden Leaf Village.

219
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,796
And I lost...

220
00:18:10,277 --> 00:18:13,614
At that place which became known
as the Final Valley.

221
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,970
I was said...to have died there.

222
00:18:18,588 --> 00:18:21,049
Even Hashirama believed it.

223
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:27,089
And everyone forgot about me...
History forgot about me.

224
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,345
Hashirama's younger brother
who became the Second Hokage

225
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,956
was determined that there would
never be a traitor like me again.

226
00:18:34,205 --> 00:18:38,585
So, as proof of his trust, he granted
the Uchiha a special position...

227
00:18:40,434 --> 00:18:42,895
And he created
the Hidden Leaf Police Force.

228
00:18:43,912 --> 00:18:45,831
But the truth is...

229
00:18:46,448 --> 00:18:49,119
This was to further distance the Uchiha
from the reins of government.

230
00:18:49,144 --> 00:18:52,773
Furthermore, it was a way to keep
a close eye on the entire clan.

231
00:18:54,161 --> 00:18:56,789
There were Uchiha members
who realized this...

232
00:18:57,619 --> 00:19:00,789
Members who wanted to carry
on my rebellion.

233
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,477
But...it was too late.

234
00:19:06,288 --> 00:19:07,706
Time passed...

235
00:19:08,108 --> 00:19:10,110
The Senju clan solidified
its hold on power

236
00:19:10,135 --> 00:19:13,931
and the Uchiha fell to
becoming Senju dogs.

237
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,489
And what I predicted came to pass.

238
00:19:18,146 --> 00:19:22,108
A certain other incident sealed
Uchiha's figurative demise.

239
00:19:26,496 --> 00:19:27,497
Yes...

240
00:19:28,384 --> 00:19:32,222
The attack of the Nine-Tailed Fox Demon
16 years ago.

241
00:19:36,693 --> 00:19:38,111
What do you mean?

242
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:42,179
The Nine-Tails can only be tamed
and controlled

243
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,099
by the ocular powers of the Uchiha.

244
00:19:45,075 --> 00:19:48,036
The higher-ups of Hidden Leaf Village
perceived the Uchiha

245
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,856
to be behind this attack.

246
00:19:52,239 --> 00:19:54,950
That was a natural occurrence,
a natural calamity.

247
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,862
The Uchiha had nothing to do with it.

248
00:19:57,901 --> 00:20:01,238
Yet suspicion fell on them...

249
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:06,038
That the Uchiha had revolted
and sought to take power.

250
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,959
As a result,
the Uchiha was put under

251
00:20:10,984 --> 00:20:13,069
the strict surveillance of
the ANBU Black Ops,

252
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:17,090
and they were forced to relocate
to the outskirts of the village.

253
00:20:17,678 --> 00:20:20,222
They became totally estranged.

254
00:20:21,729 --> 00:20:25,649
The Third Hokage was the only one
to voice opposition to our treatment.

255
00:20:26,098 --> 00:20:27,599
But Danzo of the ANBU Black Ops

256
00:20:27,624 --> 00:20:30,418
and the rest of the councilors
would not listen.

257
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:35,250
In the end,
the Uchiha clan was not trusted.

258
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:37,581
And the discrimination began...

259
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:49,190
Their distrust bred hatred and eventually,
their suspicions became reality.

260
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:56,380
The Uchiha clan plotted
a coup d'état to take over the village...

261
00:20:58,485 --> 00:21:03,740
The higher-ups in Hidden Leaf Village
planted a spy within the Uchiha clan.

262
00:21:03,765 --> 00:21:05,684
That spy was your older brother...

263
00:21:07,652 --> 00:21:10,572
From that moment,
Itachi's suffering began.

264
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,898
Despite being an Uchiha,
you were kept in the dark.

265
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,734
Because you were still young.

266
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,238
But it's all true...

267
00:21:23,978 --> 00:21:28,942
Your father, Fugaku,
was the mastermind behind the plot.

268
00:21:31,113 --> 00:21:33,741
And your brother, Itachi,
was ordered by your father

269
00:21:33,766 --> 00:21:35,852
to spy on the ANBU Black Ops.

270
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:43,051
Itachi...You also serve as
the Uchiha clan's pipeline

271
00:21:43,076 --> 00:21:44,911
to the Village nerve center.

272
00:21:46,042 --> 00:21:47,627
You know that, don't you?

273
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:51,811
However...it was actually the opposite.

274
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:56,381
Itachi was working for the village,
feeding them information about the Uchiha.

275
00:21:56,908 --> 00:21:59,494
He was what they call
a double agent.

276
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:04,772
You can't even imagine
what a heavy burden that is to bear.

277
00:22:05,311 --> 00:22:08,690
Why?! Why did Itachi betray the Uchiha?

278
00:22:10,388 --> 00:22:12,224
It may be hard for you
to understand,

279
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:14,251
not having witnessed the horrors of war.

280
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,507
The Third Great Ninja War...

281
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,298
When Itachi was merely
four years old,

282
00:22:21,323 --> 00:22:23,450
he witnessed the deaths
of many people.

283
00:22:25,064 --> 00:22:27,567
He was too young to experience war.

284
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,057
War is hell...

285
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:35,979
That trauma made Itachi
a pacifist who hated war.

286
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:40,060
He was a man who put
the village's safety first,

287
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:43,195
and who strove to preserve peace.

288
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,601
Instead of being bound
by obligation to his clan,

289
00:22:47,626 --> 00:22:49,544
he was a ninja who loved his village.

290
00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:52,652
And the village higher-ups
preyed on that trait.

291
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,583
They assigned him to
a top-secret mission.

292
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:58,835
An eye for an eye...

293
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,922
For them to oppose the Uchiha,
they would need the Sharingan.

294
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,591
Yes.

295
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,453
The mission was...

296
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:14,387
The total annihilation of
the Uchiha clan.

297
00:23:18,467 --> 00:23:24,181
I can't even begin to imagine
what he went through emotionally.

298
00:23:26,221 --> 00:23:29,516
Itachi was forced to make
a terrible choice.

299
00:23:29,957 --> 00:23:33,497
The impossible choice of killing
one's own brethren.

300
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,913
But a civil war started by the likes
of the Uchiha would shake

301
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,546
the very foundations of Hidden Leaf Village
and the Land of Fire.

302
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:46,434
Other nations would waste no time
in seizing the opportunity to attack.

303
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:50,889
It could even trigger
a Fourth Great Ninja War...

304
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,937
The Uchiha clan's self-interest would
involve innocent people

305
00:23:54,962 --> 00:23:58,049
who had nothing to do with
the ninja world.

306
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,914
And countless people would die
once again.

307
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,663
If you were Itachi,
what would you have done?

308
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,117
So Itachi made up his mind.

309
00:24:12,757 --> 00:24:15,927
He himself would bring
the curtain down on his clan.

310
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,875
He did not hate the Uchiha
nor did he betray them.

311
00:24:20,185 --> 00:24:21,728
It was inevitable.

312
00:24:22,633 --> 00:24:27,013
The discrimination by the village...
and the object of their antagonism...

313
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,483
He shouldered the blame all by himself.

314
00:24:30,508 --> 00:24:35,304
No one can ever question Itachi's decision
and the sacrifice he made.

315
00:24:37,116 --> 00:24:40,953
To be truthful, back then,
even I anticipated war.

316
00:24:42,168 --> 00:24:45,755
I was bitter towards Senju's
Hidden Leaf Village as well as the Uchiha.

317
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,030
But Itachi was even aware of that.

318
00:24:50,462 --> 00:24:53,173
He alone was aware
of my existence.

319
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:58,330
Itachi sought to contact me
and made certain conditions.

320
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:02,709
In exchange for guiding me
in my vendetta against the Uchiha,

321
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:05,111
I was not to lay a hand on the village.

322
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:09,466
He would help me kill our brethren...

323
00:25:10,157 --> 00:25:13,910
But the Third Hokage tried
a different hand.

324
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:18,653
He tried to approach the Uchiha
for a compromise.

325
00:25:20,987 --> 00:25:24,198
But time ran out,
and his efforts failed.

326
00:25:25,537 --> 00:25:27,998
Leading to that night.

327
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:32,823
It was a mission.

328
00:25:33,618 --> 00:25:36,081
To be the sole perpetrator
of his clan's slaughter

329
00:25:36,106 --> 00:25:38,691
and become a rogue ninja
with his reputation in tatters.

330
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,456
All of that was his mission.

331
00:25:42,528 --> 00:25:45,156
And Itachi completely fulfilled
his duty...

332
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:49,089
With one exception...

333
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:54,094
He could not bring himself...
to kill his younger brother.

334
00:25:55,611 --> 00:25:58,990
After that, Itachi appealed
to the Third Hokage

335
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:02,519
to protect you from Danzo
and the higher-ups.

336
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:05,564
Then he threatened Danzo
and left the village.

337
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,233
If he laid a hand on Sasuke,

338
00:26:08,258 --> 00:26:11,970
he would leak every detail about
the village to unallied nations.

339
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:15,615
Above all else,
he was concerned about you.

340
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,786
And yet he couldn't tell you
the full truth.

341
00:26:20,762 --> 00:26:23,014
He had no choice
but to say the things he did.

342
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:30,755
By making revenge your goal,
he hoped to make you strong.

343
00:26:32,288 --> 00:26:36,250
The Uchiha is a proud clan
of the Hidden Leaf.

344
00:26:36,687 --> 00:26:38,898
He wanted you to keep
believing that.

345
00:26:39,937 --> 00:26:43,315
He beseeched the Hokage that
you never learn the truth.

346
00:26:43,411 --> 00:26:44,829
And from the moment
he left the village,

347
00:26:44,854 --> 00:26:48,650
he was resolved to fighting you,
and dying.

348
00:26:49,489 --> 00:26:53,452
So that he could instill in you
a new power.

349
00:26:55,403 --> 00:26:57,322
That is Itachi's truth.

350
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,853
No, you're lying.

351
00:27:03,472 --> 00:27:06,002
They must be lies.

352
00:27:09,277 --> 00:27:10,612
That's nonsense...

353
00:27:11,767 --> 00:27:14,937
He almost killed me several times!

354
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:20,055
If Itachi wished it, he would have.
Without a doubt.

355
00:27:20,552 --> 00:27:25,890
He even used the Mangekyo Sharingan
to try to kill me!

356
00:27:25,947 --> 00:27:28,699
Your battle was part of his plan.

357
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:33,276
Itachi needed to pressure you
in that fight.

358
00:27:34,963 --> 00:27:36,631
The reason for that...

359
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,908
Well, you probably realized it too,
haven't you?

360
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:42,619
He freed you of the curse mark.

361
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,330
And the death of someone
closest to you...

362
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:49,709
It was a battle to awaken
your Mangekyo.

363
00:27:50,311 --> 00:27:53,997
It was a battle that Itachi planned
entirely for your sake.

364
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:58,677
He pretended to be after
your eyes until the very end.

365
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,848
It's starting to sink in, I see...

366
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,389
You are lying.

367
00:28:10,211 --> 00:28:12,964
The one who made the Nine-Tails attack
the village was you, Madara!

368
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,063
Itachi said so.

369
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:17,669
You framed the Uchiha!

370
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:21,157
And you teamed up with Itachi
to toy with the clan!

371
00:28:21,601 --> 00:28:23,770
Itachi was lying
when he told you that.

372
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:29,290
Itachi feared that you would
somehow learn the truth.

373
00:28:30,533 --> 00:28:33,452
He wanted to make absolutely certain
there was no chance of that.

374
00:28:33,488 --> 00:28:36,616
He lied to make sure
you would not trust me...

375
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:40,176
Not only that,
he implanted Amaterasu in your eyes.

376
00:28:40,717 --> 00:28:42,859
As if I'd believe you!

377
00:28:43,135 --> 00:28:45,346
He...Itachi was evil!

378
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:49,227
He's a criminal who killed his clan
and joined Akatsuki!

379
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:54,607
Itachi took sole responsibility for
an unspeakable crime

380
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,067
and left the village.

381
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,283
Then he found a way to join Akatsuki
and watched over

382
00:28:58,308 --> 00:29:01,144
an organization that was dangerous
to the village from the inside.

383
00:29:04,603 --> 00:29:07,063
He was always thinking
about Hidden Leaf Village.

384
00:29:08,157 --> 00:29:10,493
And he thought of you...

385
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:17,297
When the Third Hokage,
who had promised to protect you, died...

386
00:29:17,725 --> 00:29:20,388
Itachi made an appearance
in Hidden Leaf Village.

387
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:27,015
It was to tell Danzo and
the other superiors that "I am alive."

388
00:29:28,636 --> 00:29:29,933
You were foremost in his thoughts--

389
00:29:29,958 --> 00:29:33,128
Stop! Lies! They're all lies...

390
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:36,609
You're still alive, aren't you?

391
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:46,335
Your eyes did not perceive
a single thing about Itachi.

392
00:29:47,305 --> 00:29:51,309
You were not able to see through
the illusion Itachi created at all.

393
00:29:51,906 --> 00:29:56,202
Itachi killed his friends, his superiors...

394
00:29:56,270 --> 00:30:00,019
He killed his lover,
his father and his mother.

395
00:30:01,706 --> 00:30:04,959
But he could not
kill...his little brother.

396
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,389
He cried tears of blood and

397
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,340
killed every shred of feeling
he had inside him,

398
00:30:10,365 --> 00:30:13,994
then he killed his brethren
for the sake of his village.

399
00:30:15,486 --> 00:30:18,364
But he just couldn't kill you.

400
00:30:20,191 --> 00:30:22,151
Do you understand what that means?

401
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:34,958
To him, your life...
was more precious than the village.

402
00:30:38,281 --> 00:30:40,075
Until the moment of his death...

403
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,144
No, even in death, it was all for you.

404
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,973
To pass on a new power...

405
00:30:46,467 --> 00:30:50,555
By making you defeat him,
he had avenged the Uchiha clan.

406
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:54,227
In order to raise and make you
the hero of Hidden Leaf Village.

407
00:30:55,308 --> 00:30:59,265
His body was ravaged by illness
and he knew he was near death.

408
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,834
Even if he had to rely on drugs
to prolong his life...

409
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:06,656
For the sake of
his beloved little brother...

410
00:31:11,124 --> 00:31:15,420
He had to fight you...
and die in your presence.

411
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:28,887
<i>For the peace of Hidden Leaf Village,
and most of all, for Sasuke Uchiha.</i>

412
00:31:29,126 --> 00:31:34,548
<i>He wanted to die
as a criminal and a traitor.</i>

413
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,770
<i>He accepted disgrace
in the place of honor,</i>

414
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:40,189
<i>and hate in the place of love.</i>

415
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:43,693
<i>And despite that, Itachi died
with a smile on his face.</i>

416
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:49,157
<i>He entrusted the Uchiha name to you,
his younger brother,</i>

417
00:31:49,361 --> 00:31:52,364
<i>deceiving you to the very end.</i>

418
00:31:59,891 --> 00:32:01,017
<i>I'm home.</i>

419
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,799
Welcome home, Big Brother!

420
00:32:06,983 --> 00:32:09,026
Play with me, Big Brother!

421
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,846
Huh? What'll we play?!

422
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,056
Sasuke!

423
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:16,684
Your brother has
Academy homework to do.

424
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,436
You can play after he's done.

425
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,229
Huh?

426
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,986
That's okay.
I can do my homework later.

427
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,571
It's easy anyway.

428
00:32:28,596 --> 00:32:29,465
Goodness...

429
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:35,203
<i>Where could Big Brother be hiding?</i>

430
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,001
Found you, Big Brother.

431
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,963
You're pretty sharp, Sasuke.

432
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,416
However...too bad.

433
00:32:47,441 --> 00:32:49,443
Ah! No fair!

434
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,178
Say, Father...

435
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:52,929
Hmm?

436
00:32:52,954 --> 00:32:55,332
Brother and I were playing
hide-and-seek today,

437
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:58,184
but Big Brother used Clone Jutsu
to run away.

438
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,061
That's not fair, is it?

439
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:03,481
Hmm... You're able to do
the Clone Jutsu already?

440
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:08,945
Big Brother, teach me
the Clone Jutsu too, after dinner!

441
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:10,488
Homework!

442
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,911
Sorry, Sasuke.
Let's do it some other time.

443
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,956
Sasuke. It's time to go.

444
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:24,669
You said that you would teach me
a new shuriken jutsu.

445
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:28,881
I have an important mission tomorrow
that I must prepare for.

446
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,633
You're a liar...

447
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:42,854
Sorry, Sasuke.
Maybe some other time.

448
00:33:46,123 --> 00:33:47,541
Big Brother, watch this!

449
00:33:49,384 --> 00:33:51,261
Hey! Don't be reckless...

450
00:33:57,523 --> 00:33:58,565
Big Brother...

451
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:01,956
Will you train with me again?

452
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,374
Yeah...

453
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,919
But I'm assigned to missions
and starting tomorrow,

454
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:08,838
you will be attending
the Ninja Academy.

455
00:34:10,008 --> 00:34:12,927
We won't have much time
to spend together.

456
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:16,804
That's okay.

457
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,182
As long as you can stay with me
once in a while.

458
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,855
But, we only have each other
as siblings.

459
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:29,650
Even if it's only as an obstacle
for you to overcome.

460
00:34:31,293 --> 00:34:32,378
Big Brother...

461
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:38,160
Can you help me with
shuriken training today?

462
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:44,499
I'm busy.
You should ask Father to teach you.

463
00:34:44,857 --> 00:34:48,695
But you're better than Father
when it comes to shuriken jutsu.

464
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,630
Even a kid like me can see that.

465
00:34:56,324 --> 00:34:57,325
Oww.

466
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:01,057
Sorry, Sasuke...Some other time.

467
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:05,311
<i>Even if it's only as an obstacle
for you to overcome...</i>

468
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,121
<i>I'm always going to be there for you.</i>

469
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,610
<i>Even if you do hate me...</i>

470
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,488
<i>That's what big brothers are for.</i>

471
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,563
Sorry, Sasuke...

472
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,857
This is it.

473
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,761
We are no longer "Hebi."

474
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:26,309
From this day on,
our team will be "Taka."

475
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:30,354
Taka has only one goal.

476
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,231
We...

477
00:36:38,094 --> 00:36:39,595
will destroy the Hidden Leaf.

478
00:38:13,976 --> 00:38:15,436
What are you doing?

479
00:38:15,603 --> 00:38:18,231
The preparations are already complete.

480
00:38:19,168 --> 00:38:23,172
When I look upon the full moon,
it takes me back to that night.

481
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:25,887
As well as...

482
00:38:27,189 --> 00:38:29,399
the memories I've been trying to forget.

483
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:32,983
Now I can finally recall things
about Itachi...

484
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:36,498
He was crying at that moment.

485
00:38:37,791 --> 00:38:39,668
I thought I had imagined it.

486
00:38:42,546 --> 00:38:44,089
I didn't realize...

487
00:38:46,717 --> 00:38:50,012
It seems what you told me was true.

488
00:38:53,933 --> 00:38:55,059
So what will you do?

489
00:38:55,307 --> 00:38:57,726
Are you going to transplant Itachi's eyes?

490
00:38:59,188 --> 00:39:00,189
No...

491
00:39:01,523 --> 00:39:05,444
What Itachi wanted to see,
and what I will see hereafter,

492
00:39:05,566 --> 00:39:07,359
will be completely different.

493
00:39:08,238 --> 00:39:10,616
I can't do as Itachi wished me to do.

494
00:39:12,076 --> 00:39:15,663
I will restore the Uchiha clan
in my own way.

495
00:39:20,214 --> 00:39:23,984
Umm...I need to talk to you,
Kisame Senpai.

496
00:39:25,022 --> 00:39:28,692
First Zetsu,
now you come bothering me?

497
00:39:29,009 --> 00:39:31,470
I actually thought you were dead.

498
00:39:32,304 --> 00:39:35,015
It turns out that you will be
the last to know.

499
00:39:35,556 --> 00:39:39,059
I'm sorry that I had to deceive you,
the person closest to me.

500
00:39:39,561 --> 00:39:40,562
Hmm?

501
00:39:47,156 --> 00:39:50,034
So that's how it was.

502
00:39:50,698 --> 00:39:54,618
I never would have guessed
that Tobi was you.

503
00:39:55,335 --> 00:39:57,420
But I'm relieved...

504
00:39:57,699 --> 00:40:01,203
If you're the one pulling the strings,
that makes it easier for me...

505
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:05,379
Former Lord Mizukage...
I mean, Madara.

506
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:08,122
I shall continue to count on you, Kisame.

507
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,177
The same goes for me.

508
00:40:15,514 --> 00:40:17,516
<i>Itachi is out...</i>

509
00:40:19,351 --> 00:40:21,603
<i>And now, his little brother joins.</i>

510
00:40:21,645 --> 00:40:23,981
<i>What an interesting turn of events.</i>

511
00:40:25,232 --> 00:40:28,277
We, Taka, will destroy the Hidden Leaf.

512
00:40:29,972 --> 00:40:33,809
You say that, but how do you intend
to go about it?

513
00:40:34,722 --> 00:40:36,390
We're going to kill the Elders.

514
00:40:36,983 --> 00:40:40,070
The others are not
our immediate concern.

515
00:40:40,247 --> 00:40:43,208
If you aim high,
the ones below will shield them.

516
00:40:43,235 --> 00:40:45,821
It won't be that easy.

517
00:40:46,462 --> 00:40:50,758
You so-called "Taka" don't have
enough strength for that.

518
00:40:51,842 --> 00:40:53,135
Kisame Senpai...

519
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:56,016
You shouldn't underestimate us.

520
00:40:56,638 --> 00:40:59,892
We still haven't settled that
last game of ours.

521
00:41:08,785 --> 00:41:11,705
Sasuke! You haven't trained them well.

522
00:41:12,232 --> 00:41:14,276
<i>He stopped it with just his arm...!</i>

523
00:41:16,564 --> 00:41:20,617
Suigetsu! Are you stupid?
This isn't the place to...

524
00:41:20,642 --> 00:41:23,377
My objective is his Shark Skin Sword!

525
00:41:23,402 --> 00:41:26,989
I've been hanging with Sasuke only
so I could get that!

526
00:41:28,924 --> 00:41:31,510
Sasuke...What'll you do?

527
00:41:31,709 --> 00:41:32,877
All right...

528
00:41:33,316 --> 00:41:35,318
Go for it if you want to, Suigetsu.

529
00:41:36,019 --> 00:41:39,147
You probably can't beat him
yet anyway.

530
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,123
<i>Yet, huh?</i>

531
00:41:42,518 --> 00:41:44,937
Oh...thanks a lot, Sasuke.

532
00:41:45,062 --> 00:41:46,396
Just hold tight.

533
00:41:46,522 --> 00:41:49,733
I'll treat you to some tasty shark's fin
soon enough.

534
00:41:52,002 --> 00:41:54,004
The Akatsuki is also low on manpower.

535
00:41:54,432 --> 00:41:56,726
I'd like to avoid unnecessary skirmishes.

536
00:41:57,188 --> 00:42:00,775
Humph. Then you shouldn't
criticize others, you guys.

537
00:42:01,328 --> 00:42:03,622
We share common interests.

538
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:07,417
From here on, Taka will work together
with the Akatsuki.

539
00:42:08,148 --> 00:42:11,109
And what's in it for us?

540
00:42:12,157 --> 00:42:13,409
We'll give you a Tailed Beast.

541
00:42:14,341 --> 00:42:15,342
Tailed Beast?

542
00:42:15,939 --> 00:42:17,482
You don't know about them?

543
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:20,764
I know! It's like the Nine-Tails,

544
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,875
with chakra physically manifesting
as tails, they're mon-

545
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,247
In other words?

546
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:27,748
They're chakra monsters.

547
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:31,233
Originally, the First Hokage collected
several of them

548
00:42:31,258 --> 00:42:33,051
and kept them under his control.

549
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:36,321
Each time a Great Ninja War threatened,

550
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:40,386
the Hokage Hashirama used them
to maintain the power balance

551
00:42:40,566 --> 00:42:43,347
and distributed them to other lands,
starting with the five great nations,

552
00:42:43,372 --> 00:42:45,708
as proof of alliances or agreements.

553
00:42:46,165 --> 00:42:48,250
You could call them
the ultimate chakra weapons.

554
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,752
It's not a bad preposition.

555
00:42:51,837 --> 00:42:53,130
That's quite generous.

556
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:58,135
However, if you betray the Akatsuki,
you will die accordingly.

557
00:42:59,031 --> 00:42:59,820
Humph...

558
00:43:00,637 --> 00:43:03,473
There are nine Tailed Beasts
in this world.

559
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:09,295
The Akatsuki has collected six so far...
so there are three left.

560
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:13,567
The Akatsuki and Taka will split up
to hunt the remaining three.

561
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:16,570
That is our immediate goal.

562
00:43:17,756 --> 00:43:20,092
You don't have the Nine-Tails yet, right?

563
00:43:21,033 --> 00:43:22,868
Taka will capture the Eight-Tails.

564
00:43:23,327 --> 00:43:27,748
The Akatsuki will hunt the rest.
Which includes Naruto...

565
00:43:35,297 --> 00:43:36,548
<i>How did it go?</i>

566
00:43:37,007 --> 00:43:38,217
It went well...

567
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,668
<i>That's good.</i>

568
00:43:41,094 --> 00:43:45,224
Itachi is dead...
So our eyesore's finally gone.

569
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:48,084
And now,
we need no longer keep our pact

570
00:43:48,109 --> 00:43:49,735
to stay away from the Hidden Leaf.

571
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:52,105
We've waited so long...

572
00:43:52,231 --> 00:43:54,358
All so we could proceed
according to plan.

573
00:43:54,942 --> 00:43:56,068
This is fine.

574
00:43:57,486 --> 00:44:01,198
But Itachi had placed insurance
in Sasuke.

575
00:44:01,698 --> 00:44:02,741
The Amaterasu.

576
00:44:10,633 --> 00:44:15,846
Itachi believed that no one knew
the truth about him.

577
00:44:16,202 --> 00:44:17,620
So why go so far...?

578
00:44:18,282 --> 00:44:20,826
True intentions aside,

579
00:44:21,172 --> 00:44:25,259
he probably feared I would try
to recruit Sasuke.

580
00:44:25,514 --> 00:44:28,100
<i>But...who would have thought</i>

581
00:44:28,141 --> 00:44:31,645
<i>that the Akatsuki would lose so
many members to get to this point.</i>

582
00:44:32,104 --> 00:44:34,398
We had problems at every turn...

583
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:38,008
But everyone made a valuable contribution
in their own way.

584
00:44:38,946 --> 00:44:43,909
Deidara...Sasori...Hidan...Kakuzu...

585
00:44:44,799 --> 00:44:47,886
Without them,
we could not have gotten this far.

586
00:44:48,604 --> 00:44:52,733
Thanks to them, the scenario is
playing out just as I planned.

587
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:56,962
Most importantly...
I've won Sasuke over.

588
00:45:03,135 --> 00:45:05,929
So? Where is this thing called
"the Eight-Tails"?

589
00:45:06,096 --> 00:45:08,432
Don't take us lightly...

590
00:45:08,765 --> 00:45:12,436
We have no intention
of telling you a thing.

591
00:45:13,603 --> 00:45:18,608
We, the Yotsuki clan,
never betray our comrades.

592
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:19,318
That is-

593
00:45:19,343 --> 00:45:23,014
Doubt exists...in a fearful heart.

594
00:45:31,705 --> 00:45:33,874
Suigetsu, enough.

595
00:45:33,999 --> 00:45:35,584
He's under Sasuke's genjutsu.

596
00:45:35,837 --> 00:45:39,716
Shucks...I was just getting
to the fun part.

597
00:45:42,426 --> 00:45:44,720
Tell me where the Eight-Tails is.

598
00:45:45,635 --> 00:45:51,683
He is training...at Unraikyo,
Storm Cloud Ravine.

599
00:45:52,176 --> 00:45:53,802
Any distinguishing features?

600
00:45:54,911 --> 00:45:58,081
He...wields eight blades...

601
00:45:58,679 --> 00:46:04,643
And has bull horns tattooed on his...
left cheek.

602
00:46:22,798 --> 00:46:27,094
<i>Sheesh...
Those eyes of his have improved.</i>

603
00:46:27,727 --> 00:46:30,313
<i>Now he's even more difficult
to deal with.</i>

604
00:46:30,806 --> 00:46:35,353
<i>Oh wow...
Sasuke's gotten even cooler.</i>

605
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,731
<i>This is a nice place...</i>

606
00:46:40,136 --> 00:46:42,013
<i>I think I could control
my impulses here.</i>

607
00:46:42,952 --> 00:46:44,287
<i>It's calming...</i>

608
00:47:39,132 --> 00:47:41,134
You make my eyes hurt...

609
00:47:42,096 --> 00:47:43,389
Light...

610
00:47:45,098 --> 00:47:46,933
Noon already?

611
00:47:47,827 --> 00:47:51,247
Damn it, bastard! Screw you, man!

612
00:47:52,041 --> 00:47:54,585
Training from mornin',
stomach so starvin'

613
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:56,695
I'm just a rap-lovin' guy

614
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,640
and just decided on sukiyaki for lunch!

615
00:47:59,665 --> 00:48:00,833
Yay!

616
00:48:02,591 --> 00:48:03,283
Hm...?!

617
00:48:10,364 --> 00:48:12,658
Are you the Jinchuriki host
of the Eight-Tails?

618
00:48:13,033 --> 00:48:15,994
No, it's Lord Eight-Tails. Okay?

619
00:48:16,254 --> 00:48:20,049
Say, "Are you Lord Jinchuriki?" Okay?

620
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:22,334
I'm here to capture you.

621
00:48:22,584 --> 00:48:26,447
No. You have to say,
"Please allow me to capture you, sir."

622
00:48:26,472 --> 00:48:28,474
Okay? Right?

623
00:48:28,798 --> 00:48:30,300
Suigetsu, you take the right.

624
00:48:32,052 --> 00:48:33,428
Jugo, you take the left.

625
00:48:35,347 --> 00:48:37,265
Karin, get behind me.

626
00:48:42,303 --> 00:48:44,931
Hmm...Let's see.

627
00:48:46,913 --> 00:48:48,998
Right in the middle of our conversation...

628
00:48:49,194 --> 00:48:50,487
Here's some serious advice!

629
00:48:50,512 --> 00:48:51,513
You're fools!

630
00:48:51,642 --> 00:48:52,727
Fools.

631
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:58,100
We can't kill the Jinchuriki.

632
00:48:58,176 --> 00:49:01,221
Isn't that what the Akatsuki
told us, Suigetsu?

633
00:49:01,665 --> 00:49:02,749
It's all right.

634
00:49:02,774 --> 00:49:04,943
I can feel his chakra.

635
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,132
Geez, talk about a showy diversion.

636
00:49:15,534 --> 00:49:16,785
Why you...!

637
00:49:18,848 --> 00:49:22,143
The only one who gets
to dig me is me...

638
00:49:22,394 --> 00:49:26,064
So scram, you fools, or I'll blast y'all!

639
00:49:26,106 --> 00:49:27,857
You fools...Yeah!

640
00:49:32,902 --> 00:49:34,612
Suigetsu, get back.

641
00:49:37,842 --> 00:49:40,152
I'm peeking through...
And see you alive...

642
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:42,346
But y'all are so brainless!

643
00:49:43,398 --> 00:49:44,691
Stop joking around!

644
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,886
My thirst for blood is my courage...

645
00:49:46,911 --> 00:49:48,662
Making me so optimistic.

646
00:49:48,811 --> 00:49:51,272
My blades are swirlin',
but my store's a closin'.

647
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:55,041
Making for a blow-out sale
for my performance!

648
00:49:55,188 --> 00:49:56,189
Yeah...

649
00:50:18,735 --> 00:50:20,982
I've got spare power and
my appeal is glowing,

650
00:50:21,007 --> 00:50:22,003
Eight-Tails the bridge.

651
00:50:22,028 --> 00:50:25,031
Killer Bee, that's me! Ah! Yay!

652
00:50:26,166 --> 00:50:28,668
Start fighting and
you're gonna be embarrassed.

653
00:50:28,693 --> 00:50:30,778
'Cuz you'll be torn apart...

654
00:50:31,504 --> 00:50:32,505
Bit my tongue...

655
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:34,908
Wh-What's with this guy?

656
00:50:35,216 --> 00:50:38,428
He's totally crazy, but that Jugo...

657
00:50:38,841 --> 00:50:42,345
<i>He keeps dodging
my Executioner's blade...</i>

658
00:50:43,005 --> 00:50:44,382
<i>What is this guy?!</i>

659
00:50:44,702 --> 00:50:47,413
You made me bite my tongue...Fools!

660
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,429
Are you all right?!

661
00:50:57,739 --> 00:50:58,740
Yeah...

662
00:51:02,332 --> 00:51:03,458
I'll go.

663
00:51:27,495 --> 00:51:30,957
Who the heck are you all?
Fools...You fools!

664
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,951
This guy's getting on my nerves!

665
00:51:34,043 --> 00:51:38,214
Who are you?
Why would you capture me? Huh?

666
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:41,157
We don't owe you an explanation.

667
00:51:41,533 --> 00:51:47,455
A guy who talks in weird verses...
is such a pain to deal with.

668
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:50,511
It's to obtain power
as quickly as possible.

669
00:51:51,292 --> 00:51:52,627
If you don't like it, leave.

670
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:53,566
Tsk...

671
00:51:54,471 --> 00:51:56,431
<i>That's your prerogative...</i>

672
00:51:57,211 --> 00:51:59,213
I also want to confirm whether

673
00:51:59,238 --> 00:52:02,867
the Akatsuki's verbal promise is
true or false and get it over with.

674
00:52:06,614 --> 00:52:11,458
Either way, we're the ones who
are going to use the Akatsuki.

675
00:52:11,862 --> 00:52:14,323
Keep that in mind.

676
00:52:14,794 --> 00:52:16,087
<i>The Akatsuki?</i>

677
00:52:17,554 --> 00:52:18,638
That goes without question.

678
00:52:19,028 --> 00:52:21,948
<i>Y-You are so cool, Sasuke!</i>

679
00:52:22,323 --> 00:52:25,827
<i>I knew he wouldn't let himself
be used as a pawn.</i>

680
00:52:26,583 --> 00:52:31,713
Well then, let's get to it and
silence this irritating rapper.

681
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:33,777
I intend to.

682
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,003
It's not irritating...

683
00:52:35,044 --> 00:52:37,922
It's cool rhythms and rhymes.
You fool! Ah! Yeah!!

684
00:52:39,048 --> 00:52:41,510
He's really...irritating!

685
00:52:41,535 --> 00:52:43,370
He's got zero rapping talent!

686
00:52:43,395 --> 00:52:45,355
What?! You fool! You jerk!

687
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:46,423
Will you shut up?!

688
00:53:50,578 --> 00:53:52,247
I'm feeling good right now.

689
00:53:52,272 --> 00:53:53,816
Just came up with
the greatest rhyme.

690
00:53:53,841 --> 00:53:54,842
Thank you.

691
00:53:56,626 --> 00:53:59,921
That's why I'll play with you...
You foolish baby!

692
00:54:09,848 --> 00:54:12,892
I'll give you a taste of my hook.

693
00:55:17,837 --> 00:55:19,589
What?! He countered it?!

694
00:55:22,211 --> 00:55:25,173
<i>He can stream his chakra too?!</i>

695
00:55:28,538 --> 00:55:31,249
Float...Float like a butterfly...!

696
00:55:36,674 --> 00:55:39,301
Eight-Tails! Sting like a bee!

697
00:55:49,681 --> 00:55:50,807
Sasuke!

698
00:55:53,709 --> 00:55:56,712
And this is the finishing sting!

699
00:56:10,093 --> 00:56:13,262
<i>He also uses...
Lightning Style, which is my weakness.</i>

700
00:56:23,472 --> 00:56:24,515
Sasuke!

701
00:56:44,482 --> 00:56:45,483
Sasuke!

702
00:56:50,218 --> 00:56:51,219
This is bad...

703
00:56:52,423 --> 00:56:53,716
Here, Sasuke...

704
00:56:53,767 --> 00:56:55,352
Hurry up and bite me!

705
00:56:55,927 --> 00:56:56,969
Do it now!

706
00:57:18,828 --> 00:57:20,682
<i>He funneled the Lightning Style
through his body</i>

707
00:57:20,707 --> 00:57:22,709
<i>and shifted the course of my attack.</i>

708
00:57:23,474 --> 00:57:25,977
<i>He avoided a fatal injury...</i>

709
00:57:26,256 --> 00:57:28,425
<i>And...that woman possesses
the ability</i>

710
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:30,994
<i>to heal others by letting them
suck her chakra.</i>

711
00:57:37,238 --> 00:57:39,198
Thanks, Karin.

712
00:57:39,682 --> 00:57:40,474
Sure...

713
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:42,652
Sasuke! Let's do this together!

714
00:57:43,461 --> 00:57:46,214
The fact is this guy is super strong.

715
00:57:46,667 --> 00:57:50,004
We should go at him as if
we are trying to kill him, instead of not.

716
00:57:50,256 --> 00:57:52,592
That way we can probably take him
down without killing him.

717
00:57:58,991 --> 00:58:01,786
Looks like this battle is gonna drag on...

718
00:58:02,306 --> 00:58:03,641
Check it out, yo!

719
00:58:19,168 --> 00:58:20,294
Got you!

720
00:58:20,554 --> 00:58:22,348
Sasuke, now! Just do the both of us!

721
00:58:24,569 --> 00:58:25,570
<i>Chidori!</i>

722
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:47,763
<i>Gone! Where is he?</i>

723
00:58:51,035 --> 00:58:53,454
So weak, yet so persistent...

724
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:56,665
I'm done playing,
now go home for some drinking! Yeah!

725
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,373
- Karin!
- I know...

726
00:59:04,445 --> 00:59:05,529
Over there!

727
00:59:06,509 --> 00:59:09,512
<i>That woman's also a sensory-type, eh?</i>

728
00:59:14,225 --> 00:59:15,351
Can't be helped...

729
00:59:15,539 --> 00:59:16,623
Going with the eighth tail.

730
00:59:24,871 --> 00:59:26,038
<i>Here it comes...</i>

731
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:28,124
<i>It's the same as back then.</i>

732
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:41,679
<i>Hmm...He's the first to dodge
my Eight-Tails form</i>

733
00:59:41,721 --> 00:59:42,972
<i>since my brother.</i>

734
00:59:47,226 --> 00:59:48,978
Damn, he's going after the others!

735
00:59:49,594 --> 00:59:51,888
First, you guys will be torn apart!

736
01:00:09,916 --> 01:00:10,917
Are you all right?

737
01:00:11,836 --> 01:00:13,629
Yeah...more or less...

738
01:00:19,483 --> 01:00:22,069
<i>He definitely has speed and power.</i>

739
01:00:22,136 --> 01:00:24,055
<i>But he only moves in
a linear fashion.</i>

740
01:00:24,096 --> 01:00:26,307
<i>My eyes should be able to
make them out.</i>

741
01:00:26,678 --> 01:00:30,765
Karin! Read his chakra and
predict his movements!

742
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:34,106
Stay on him and keep me informed
of his location at all times!

743
01:00:35,459 --> 01:00:37,670
That's if you can really keep up!

744
01:00:42,996 --> 01:00:46,625
<i>Those eyes...The Sharingan!
Is this genjutsu?</i>

745
01:00:47,245 --> 01:00:49,080
<i>I can't move my body.</i>

746
01:01:00,509 --> 01:01:01,928
Lariat!

747
01:01:09,087 --> 01:01:10,380
Sasuke!

748
01:01:17,608 --> 01:01:18,609
Wha--?!

749
01:01:18,776 --> 01:01:20,152
What is this?

750
01:01:20,442 --> 01:01:24,196
His neck and chest portion have
been blown off, organs and all.

751
01:01:29,939 --> 01:01:31,649
He's beyond our...

752
01:01:33,708 --> 01:01:36,502
<i>He is like my reincarnation.</i>

753
01:01:39,005 --> 01:01:40,214
Hang in there!

754
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:42,781
Karin, it's all right. I'll do it.

755
01:01:43,175 --> 01:01:45,386
The chakra you have now
can't deal with it.

756
01:01:45,511 --> 01:01:46,804
What do you intend to do?

757
01:01:47,077 --> 01:01:51,206
I'll distribute my body and chakra to
Sasuke by merging with him.

758
01:01:51,726 --> 01:01:55,646
Since his body was compatible with
my curse mark, it should work.

759
01:02:00,905 --> 01:02:02,273
In order to release the genjutsu,

760
01:02:02,298 --> 01:02:06,510
I need a partner to disturb
my chakra and awaken me.

761
01:02:07,113 --> 01:02:10,116
My partner is
the Eight-Tails inside me.

762
01:02:10,536 --> 01:02:13,039
A genjutsu has no effect on
the Jinchuriki host,

763
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:14,623
which controls a Tailed Beast.

764
01:02:16,792 --> 01:02:20,004
Your illusions I obliterate,
then you all I shall annihilate.

765
01:02:20,046 --> 01:02:23,758
My true form of the Jinchuriki...

766
01:02:25,645 --> 01:02:28,064
<i>It's a monster, so watch it now,</i>

767
01:02:28,089 --> 01:02:31,092
<i>Host Transformation, yeah...</i>

768
01:02:46,864 --> 01:02:49,617
<i>Eight-Tails will pee your pants,
you lil' ants!</i>

769
01:02:55,581 --> 01:02:59,126
<i>Such chakra...
Is this even possible?</i>

770
01:02:59,487 --> 01:03:00,697
That's the Eight-Tails?

771
01:03:01,379 --> 01:03:05,466
<i>An ox-octopus monster...
That's his true form?</i>

772
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:10,990
<i>To spear my foes,
my glorious longhorns!</i>

773
01:03:14,688 --> 01:03:16,357
<i>His chakra is off the scale...</i>

774
01:03:16,685 --> 01:03:17,895
<i>We'll die if we stay here!</i>

775
01:03:18,229 --> 01:03:19,730
Jugo, are you done yet?!

776
01:03:27,988 --> 01:03:29,990
<i>Thank goodness...Sasuke...</i>

777
01:03:30,783 --> 01:03:33,536
You're conscious.
Come on, get up!

778
01:03:33,869 --> 01:03:35,579
All right, Jugo...Huh?!

779
01:03:36,053 --> 01:03:37,596
<i>He turned into a child?! Why?!</i>

780
01:03:37,957 --> 01:03:38,999
Jugo...

781
01:03:40,314 --> 01:03:42,149
I won't let you die...

782
01:03:42,427 --> 01:03:44,346
You're a memento of Kimimaro.

783
01:03:44,964 --> 01:03:47,341
Come on! Hurry! We gotta run!

784
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:57,017
<i>A Water-Style ninja...I knew it.</i>

785
01:03:57,309 --> 01:03:59,019
<i>You have the advantage
of the terrain!</i>

786
01:04:00,448 --> 01:04:01,825
I'll take over from here!

787
01:04:02,565 --> 01:04:04,024
Run while you can!

788
01:04:07,987 --> 01:04:08,863
Suigetsu...

789
01:04:08,904 --> 01:04:09,905
Let's go, Sasuke.

790
01:04:13,033 --> 01:04:14,827
<i>Heh. Who would've thought...</i>

791
01:04:14,869 --> 01:04:17,955
<i>that I'd end up sacrificing myself
to save their hides this often?</i>

792
01:04:21,917 --> 01:04:26,213
<i>As if I'd let you get away after
what you've done, you fool, you jerk!</i>

793
01:04:32,595 --> 01:04:33,929
Th-That really doesn't look good.

794
01:05:01,999 --> 01:05:04,210
Could that be Lord Killer Bee's?!

795
01:05:04,251 --> 01:05:06,003
Wh-What is it, Senpai?!

796
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:07,963
- Let's go!
- Yes, sir!

797
01:05:12,927 --> 01:05:14,428
Th-That's...!

798
01:05:19,433 --> 01:05:20,726
Lord Killer Bee...

799
01:05:21,227 --> 01:05:22,978
Why has he transformed into
the Eight-Tails?!

800
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:25,731
And after all that lecturing
from Lord Raikage...

801
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:28,901
Look closely!
He's battling someone!

802
01:05:30,361 --> 01:05:31,487
Those robes...

803
01:05:32,404 --> 01:05:33,781
Are they the Akatsuki?

804
01:05:33,989 --> 01:05:35,950
The ones who kidnapped Yugito?

805
01:05:38,639 --> 01:05:40,767
Suigetsu is wasted...Damn it!

806
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:43,910
We can't get away...What'll we do?!

807
01:06:05,388 --> 01:06:06,389
He's coming!

808
01:06:12,611 --> 01:06:13,821
<i>Amaterasu!</i>

809
01:06:25,249 --> 01:06:28,252
<i>S-So those are the inextinguishable
black flames Sasuke spoke of!</i>

810
01:06:31,922 --> 01:06:33,966
<i>A-Awesome!</i>

811
01:07:09,043 --> 01:07:10,252
Karin, run!

812
01:07:17,259 --> 01:07:18,886
Damn! The black flames!

813
01:07:19,219 --> 01:07:20,471
It's too late for Karin.

814
01:07:20,971 --> 01:07:24,224
We need to get away before
we get caught too!

815
01:07:24,391 --> 01:07:26,018
- Wait, Jugo.
- No!

816
01:07:31,315 --> 01:07:32,608
<i>Karin!</i>

817
01:07:51,877 --> 01:07:53,837
Jugo! Get Karin! Hurry!

818
01:08:01,887 --> 01:08:03,722
The black flames are extinguished...

819
01:08:04,098 --> 01:08:05,557
What's going on, Sasuke?

820
01:08:05,974 --> 01:08:10,104
<i>I was able to extinguish
the black flames of Amaterasu.</i>

821
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:15,025
<i>Are these the visual powers
of my Mangekyo Sharingan?!</i>

822
01:08:16,780 --> 01:08:17,948
<i>In which case...</i>

823
01:08:34,865 --> 01:08:37,785
The Eight-Tails...
It seems he's barely alive.

824
01:08:37,923 --> 01:08:40,884
Then...we managed to take down
the Eight-Tails without killing him.

825
01:08:40,926 --> 01:08:42,302
Let's grab him and go.

826
01:08:44,947 --> 01:08:47,658
No way...
Lord Killer Bee has been defeated?

827
01:08:47,735 --> 01:08:49,278
I-It must be some mistake...

828
01:08:49,768 --> 01:08:50,853
Shall we rescue him?

829
01:08:51,036 --> 01:08:53,622
They're Akatsuki members.
Don't be hasty.

830
01:08:54,076 --> 01:08:55,411
Huh?! That's...

831
01:08:55,524 --> 01:08:56,525
What is it?!

832
01:08:57,528 --> 01:08:58,863
The Uchiha crest!

833
01:08:59,153 --> 01:09:00,154
Uchiha?

834
01:09:00,434 --> 01:09:04,897
Rather than taking action ourselves,
we'd better get word to Lord Raikage!

835
01:09:05,458 --> 01:09:07,710
If he hears what happened
to his younger brother...

836
01:09:07,995 --> 01:09:11,039
Knowing Lord Raikage,
he won't be pleased at all.

837
01:09:21,675 --> 01:09:23,635
You seem quite affected, physically.

838
01:09:24,166 --> 01:09:26,447
Especially since, in addition to
losing Orochimaru's curse mark,

839
01:09:26,472 --> 01:09:28,932
you haven't quite healed from
your battle against Itachi.

840
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:30,492
Yeah...

841
01:09:30,517 --> 01:09:33,771
Though I really didn't expect
we'd have such a fight on our hands.

842
01:09:35,773 --> 01:09:37,232
But now...

843
01:11:10,638 --> 01:11:11,681
What?!

844
01:11:11,896 --> 01:11:14,107
Killer Bee was taken?!

845
01:11:14,434 --> 01:11:16,604
A member of the Hidden Leaf...
from the Uchiha clan

846
01:11:16,629 --> 01:11:18,047
was among the assailants.

847
01:11:18,367 --> 01:11:20,332
My partner is tailing them right now.

848
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:23,839
Lord Raikage, what are your orders?

849
01:11:24,287 --> 01:11:26,129
The Akatsuki won't get away
with this!

850
01:11:26,154 --> 01:11:27,447
The Akatsuki...!

851
01:11:30,512 --> 01:11:33,432
Just you wait, my brother!
