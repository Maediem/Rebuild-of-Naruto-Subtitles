1
00:00:01,292 --> 00:00:02,794
Is that it?

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:08,425
You didn’t kill all of them…
How naïve.

3
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:11,803
There are others I’d rather kill.

4
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:19,561
Unless you become heartless,
you will not defeat Itachi.

5
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:27,819
When I stand before him, I’ll be
heartless, whether I want to be or not.

6
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,287
<i>Not even a tiny spurt of blood…</i>

7
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,080
<i>When I watch this boy…</i>

8
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:41,708
<i>I look back to the time
I was called a genius…</i>

9
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:44,027
<i>and think how ridiculous that was.</i>

10
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:52,177
<i>Very soon...so very soon,
he will be mine…!</i>

11
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:41,911
What is this?

12
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:45,039
Ah! How lucky of you to find this.

13
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,917
It's the skin of a white snake.

14
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:50,578
I've never...seen anything
like it before.

15
00:02:52,152 --> 00:02:53,987
Actually, neither have I.

16
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:58,052
It's a rare item that
you almost never see.

17
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,054
Why is it white?

18
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:03,050
Well, I don't really know.

19
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,768
No one really cares about
such things.

20
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,688
But from times past,

21
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,608
the white snake has been
a symbol of good luck and renewal.

22
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,528
Good luck and renewal...

23
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,661
It must be some sort of karma
for you to find it here.

24
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:28,208
Perhaps your parents are
now reborn somewhere.

25
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:33,129
Maybe someday...
you'll meet them when you're grown up.

26
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,548
When would that be...?

27
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:39,135
Who knows? I couldn't say.

28
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,614
<i>Nawaki...sure is eager.</i>

29
00:04:25,535 --> 00:04:28,871
We're at war...after all.

30
00:04:33,868 --> 00:04:35,744
<i>Tsunade's team has been...?</i>

31
00:04:40,486 --> 00:04:43,156
Stop! Stop! Stop!

32
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:44,349
I said, stop!

33
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:46,587
That's enough! He's dead!

34
00:04:51,044 --> 00:04:55,882
<i>Humans...are such fragile beings.</i>

35
00:04:58,634 --> 00:05:04,431
<i>Power that was not used in a lifetime
rests inside the human body.</i>

36
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,140
<i>If we could release that power...</i>

37
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,808
Orochimaru Sensei!

38
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,202
What is this?

39
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,521
An amulet.

40
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,898
An amulet...? This...?

41
00:05:19,457 --> 00:05:25,797
It's a very rare amulet for
good luck and renewal.

42
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,405
Renewal? With this...?

43
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,622
But...Orochimaru Sensei,

44
00:05:31,647 --> 00:05:33,691
no matter how earnest you are
about your research,

45
00:05:33,716 --> 00:05:36,343
you can't bring back the dead,
can you?

46
00:05:37,246 --> 00:05:41,417
Yes...Bringing the dead
back to life is difficult.

47
00:05:42,193 --> 00:05:46,239
But, I've grasped a clue
about regeneration.

48
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:49,673
By activating their bodies,

49
00:05:49,698 --> 00:05:52,367
humans can become immensely
more powerful

50
00:05:52,392 --> 00:05:56,063
and heighten their regenerative powers too.

51
00:05:57,214 --> 00:06:02,094
I will share that power
with you some day, as well.

52
00:06:02,453 --> 00:06:05,748
Yes! Thank you very much,
Orochimaru Sensei!

53
00:06:07,445 --> 00:06:11,574
<i>The Body Activating Jutsu
called the Curse Mark...</i>

54
00:06:42,233 --> 00:06:45,319
<i>How foolish!
There's a limit to unreasonable training!</i>

55
00:07:10,786 --> 00:07:12,120
Beautiful...

56
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,601
So this is the power of the Sharingan.

57
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:19,129
No matter how many ninja try
to enter this territory...

58
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:25,403
No matter how hard they train,
they could never surpass the Uchiha.

59
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,007
<i>I understand...</i>

60
00:07:46,872 --> 00:07:50,167
<i>I understand the awesomeness
of this jutsu...</i>

61
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:56,131
<i>But, it would take at least one month
to master this forbidden jutsu...</i>

62
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:08,070
<i>How many years would it take
to master all the jutsu that are here...?</i>

63
00:08:09,327 --> 00:08:12,372
<i>It's impossible to grasp all the jutsu</i>

64
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,745
<i>within the limited time
of a human lifespan...</i>

65
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:21,309
<i>There would be a limit even if I could
extend my life via a Reanimation Jutsu...</i>

66
00:08:22,643 --> 00:08:25,813
<i>Once I die, everything would be lost...</i>

67
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,178
<i>In order to grasp every jutsu,
I would have to...</i>

68
00:08:38,327 --> 00:08:41,747
Orochimaru! So it was you,
just as I suspected...

69
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,733
Tell me! What were you doing here?

70
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,989
You probably couldn't understand...

71
00:08:52,835 --> 00:08:57,464
You who puts the village
before your own reason.

72
00:08:58,297 --> 00:09:01,967
To me, the lifespan of
the human body is too short.

73
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,003
Even if I were to be called a Hokage,

74
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:09,642
once I die,
everything would end there.

75
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:13,219
The jutsu you're experimenting with...
It can't be...?!

76
00:09:13,976 --> 00:09:18,689
That very one...
the Immortality Jutsu!

77
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:22,962
Can't you reconsider Orochimaru?

78
00:09:23,053 --> 00:09:24,012
Out of the question!

79
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,525
<i>How stupid can you be?!</i>

80
00:09:29,785 --> 00:09:31,119
<i>I'm so close...</i>

81
00:09:31,384 --> 00:09:34,846
<i>So close with my research.</i>

82
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,705
<i>I will have everything.</i>

83
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:45,793
<i>My vessel is neither this body,
nor the Leaf!</i>

84
00:09:47,081 --> 00:09:51,710
<i>To that end, I will use that organization
and anything else!</i>

85
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:06,856
<i>You destroyed the Uchiha.
What brings you to the Akatsuki?</i>

86
00:10:16,334 --> 00:10:21,464
One who possesses the precious Sharingan
appears before me...

87
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:25,916
How lucky I am...

88
00:10:26,922 --> 00:10:30,008
I will have your body!

89
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:40,355
Could it be... that I...
am under a Paralysis Genjutsu...

90
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,977
What visual prowess...

91
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,104
Marvelous...

92
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,420
Orochimaru...

93
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:17,760
Any jutsu you use will have
no effect before these eyes.

94
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:21,736
Lord Orochimaru!

95
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,772
What are you doing, Kabuto...?!

96
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,943
Are you all right, Lord Orochimaru?

97
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:40,507
I'm fine...
That body will be mine shortly.

98
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:45,538
I will be reanimated soon.
I feel great...

99
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,168
You've reached your limit.

100
00:11:51,858 --> 00:11:55,320
In your condition, if I don't administer
a rank 10 medication, your body will...

101
00:11:58,007 --> 00:11:59,508
I will change medications.

102
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,935
It will just take a minute.

103
00:12:31,869 --> 00:12:34,205
<i>The nature of this chakra...</i>

104
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:38,174
<i>But, I've never seen
this change in chakra form before.</i>

105
00:12:39,273 --> 00:12:40,858
Who is it?!

106
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,283
You came...just as I thought you would.

107
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,621
I have nothing more to learn from you.

108
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,791
Even here before you...

109
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,377
I think I can become heartless.

110
00:13:29,815 --> 00:13:32,985
Orochimaru, you are weaker than me.

111
00:13:34,111 --> 00:13:38,240
There's no longer any need for me
to give you my body.

112
00:13:39,158 --> 00:13:42,703
You have some nerve...
you're still an Uchiha fledgling!

113
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:47,500
If I hadn't been a fledgling,
you would've had no chance at me, right?

114
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,418
You...

115
00:13:50,938 --> 00:13:55,359
Itachi didn't work out...
That's why you came after me, a fledgling.

116
00:13:56,684 --> 00:14:00,563
Isn't that right?
You who they called the Genius Sannin.

117
00:14:02,658 --> 00:14:07,079
But you turned out to be what they call
on the streets, "just an ordinary prodigy."

118
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:10,802
You couldn't even live up to
the Uchiha name, much less surpass it.

119
00:14:11,774 --> 00:14:16,487
Even the best prodigy is only ordinary
against the Uchiha name.

120
00:14:17,492 --> 00:14:19,603
What you did...

121
00:14:20,157 --> 00:14:23,035
disgustingly trying to approach
the powers of the Uchiha

122
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,146
by drowning yourself in drugs and
trying to overcome your body...

123
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:30,459
It seems so shameless and comical to me,
who possesses that name.

124
00:14:31,602 --> 00:14:34,229
And what's more,
I don't like the way you do things.

125
00:14:36,573 --> 00:14:41,841
You continued to toy with others for
your own stupid and selfish reasons...

126
00:14:45,669 --> 00:14:48,463
<i>Why...Brother?</i>

127
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:53,016
<i>To measure my own abilities.</i>

128
00:14:53,274 --> 00:14:55,651
<i>Measure your own abilities...?</i>

129
00:14:55,786 --> 00:14:57,205
<i>Is that all?</i>

130
00:14:58,154 --> 00:15:03,451
<i>Is that the only reason...
you killed everyone?!</i>

131
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:06,178
<i>That's what's important.</i>

132
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,786
You make me sick!

133
00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:25,139
A snake with white scales...
so that is your true form...

134
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:28,577
You conducted experiment
after experiment

135
00:15:28,602 --> 00:15:30,604
so that you could move
from body to body...

136
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,797
and that's how you ended up?

137
00:15:33,325 --> 00:15:39,331
<i>Now, Sasuke...
Give me your body!</i>

138
00:16:10,184 --> 00:16:16,398
A snake that slithers on the ground
can only dream of flying through the air.

139
00:16:16,883 --> 00:16:21,241
You wanted it so badly that
you went after the fledgling in the nest...

140
00:16:21,654 --> 00:16:24,031
But you became targeted
as the prey instead...

141
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:38,420
By the eyes of a hawk
soaring high above in the sky.

142
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:41,958
<i>Sasuke!</i>

143
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,141
You've come.

144
00:16:52,613 --> 00:16:55,074
Now, let's go...

145
00:16:59,522 --> 00:17:04,110
<i>My future lies in this child!</i>

146
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:19,473
It's over...That was too quick.

147
00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:31,845
<i>Looks like it's beginning
to take effect...</i>

148
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:37,179
<i>The body fluid of the giant white snake
skin vaporizes upon contact with the air</i>

149
00:17:37,204 --> 00:17:39,248
<i>and becomes an anesthetic.</i>

150
00:17:39,983 --> 00:17:41,734
<i>I am immortal.</i>

151
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:46,329
<i>The likes of your jutsu cannot kill me...!</i>

152
00:17:46,673 --> 00:17:47,800
<i>Now then...</i>

153
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,286
<i>I shall have you now!</i>

154
00:18:01,462 --> 00:18:02,630
<i>What is this?</i>

155
00:18:03,213 --> 00:18:07,468
<i>This is...a different
space inside my body.</i>

156
00:18:07,885 --> 00:18:11,430
<i>Here, the Transference
Ritual will be held...</i>

157
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:17,394
<i>We'll begin now.</i>

158
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:38,937
<i>What visual prowess...Marvelous...</i>

159
00:18:40,588 --> 00:18:44,175
<i>This is almost like...that time...</i>

160
00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:49,927
<i>Those eyes...</i>

161
00:18:52,638 --> 00:18:56,767
<i>Those eyes will be mine at last...!</i>

162
00:18:57,681 --> 00:18:59,683
<i>He won't last with only the medicine...</i>

163
00:19:00,521 --> 00:19:04,233
<i>He'll have to do the Transference Ritual
as soon as today...</i>

164
00:19:07,574 --> 00:19:08,394
<i>But...</i>

165
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:12,449
<i>It's hard to believe that
Sasuke would consent willingly...</i>

166
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:25,087
<i>Well, even Sasuke
can't resist that ritual...</i>

167
00:19:46,692 --> 00:19:49,236
<i>That is the cast-off skin
of the giant snake...</i>

168
00:19:49,445 --> 00:19:52,573
<i>Does that mean the ritual
is already done?</i>

169
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,745
<i>What's going on?</i>

170
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,832
Kabuto, is that you?

171
00:20:16,691 --> 00:20:18,068
Which one...

172
00:20:19,892 --> 00:20:21,477
are you now?

173
00:20:29,905 --> 00:20:31,253
Which one do you think?

174
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:50,529
<i>This is the Transference Ritual!</i>

175
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:54,003
<i>He's showing me the
memories of the ritual!</i>

176
00:20:56,624 --> 00:20:59,943
<i>The ritual between the two
will be settled right now!</i>

177
00:21:25,436 --> 00:21:26,336
<i>What the?</i>

178
00:21:30,595 --> 00:21:32,195
<i>This...can't be!</i>

179
00:21:32,227 --> 00:21:36,512
<i>This is a place I created.
This is impossible!</i>

180
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,140
<i>Impossible!</i>

181
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:40,164
<i>It can't be...</i>

182
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,892
<i>This is my only...</i>

183
00:21:47,493 --> 00:21:48,793
<i>Orochimaru...</i>

184
00:21:49,507 --> 00:21:53,694
<i>Any jutsu you use will have
no effect before these eyes.</i>

185
00:21:58,157 --> 00:22:01,057
<i>You should have
realized that by now.</i>

186
00:22:03,528 --> 00:22:04,928
<i>How hideous...</i>

187
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,940
<i>Sasuke's will is eroding this space!</i>

188
00:22:13,186 --> 00:22:16,615
<i>I'm not going to let this happen!</i>

189
00:22:17,304 --> 00:22:19,720
<i>I am the immortal Orochimaru!</i>

190
00:22:20,611 --> 00:22:23,411
<i>Not here!</i>

191
00:22:24,607 --> 00:22:27,980
<i>I won't let this happen here!</i>

192
00:22:28,704 --> 00:22:32,132
<i>I am the one to unravel
the order of this world!</i>

193
00:22:32,738 --> 00:22:36,405
<i>Everything...will be mine!</i>

194
00:22:41,745 --> 00:22:43,538
Lord Orochimaru is dead.

195
00:22:44,664 --> 00:22:47,125
No...It's almost as if...

196
00:22:48,627 --> 00:22:52,714
I took over all that he was.

197
00:23:20,617 --> 00:23:22,577
I knew it was you...

198
00:23:23,244 --> 00:23:27,540
The fact that you're here must mean
you killed Orochimaru.

199
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:29,376
Yeah.

200
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,563
But never mind that.
Let's get you out of here.

201
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:48,770
Free at last. Thank you, Sasuke.

202
00:23:49,769 --> 00:23:52,730
Suigetsu, you're the first.

203
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:54,734
Come with me.

204
00:23:55,235 --> 00:23:59,698
Me, first? There are others then?

205
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:03,609
Two others. I'm taking Jugo
from the northern hideout

206
00:24:03,743 --> 00:24:05,954
and Karin from the southern hideout.

207
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,998
Are you sure about that?

208
00:24:09,082 --> 00:24:10,083
What is it?

209
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:14,170
It's nothing...
Just that I don't like them.

210
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:21,344
I can't get along with them...
At least, that's what I think.

211
00:24:22,971 --> 00:24:24,889
Sure, you picked me,

212
00:24:24,931 --> 00:24:28,727
but I wonder about choosing
those two, Sasuke.

213
00:24:29,686 --> 00:24:32,564
Enough with the rambling.
Put on your clothes.

214
00:24:33,231 --> 00:24:34,232
We're going.

215
00:24:35,692 --> 00:24:38,194
Ordering me around like a big shot, eh?

216
00:24:41,364 --> 00:24:44,784
Let me clarify the relationship
between you and me...

217
00:24:46,494 --> 00:24:47,579
All right?

218
00:24:50,206 --> 00:24:54,210
Sorry, but you chose to rescue me.

219
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:58,381
I never said anything about following you.

220
00:24:59,257 --> 00:25:03,428
Just because you defeated Orochimaru
doesn't make you better than me.

221
00:25:04,304 --> 00:25:05,930
Everyone was after him.

222
00:25:06,973 --> 00:25:08,725
You were Orochimaru's pet,

223
00:25:08,725 --> 00:25:11,811
so you weren't imprisoned
and you stayed by his side.

224
00:25:12,896 --> 00:25:16,441
You had more chances to kill him
than the rest of us.

225
00:25:23,323 --> 00:25:25,825
Gotcha...Just kidding.

226
00:25:27,243 --> 00:25:32,332
But I let you go just now,
so that makes us even.

227
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:37,712
I'm free at last,
so I'm going to do as I please.

228
00:25:39,553 --> 00:25:40,554
I see.

229
00:25:41,424 --> 00:25:42,509
That's unfortunate.

230
00:25:47,276 --> 00:25:48,444
By the way...

231
00:25:49,095 --> 00:25:50,638
It was your team, wasn't it?

232
00:25:53,937 --> 00:25:57,649
The team that brought down
my great predecessor, Zabuza Momochi.

233
00:26:01,955 --> 00:26:06,334
Whatever happened to his blade...
the Executioner's Blade?

234
00:26:08,952 --> 00:26:10,703
Let's do this.

235
00:26:11,226 --> 00:26:16,439
If you tell me where the blade is,
and I take possession of it,

236
00:26:16,887 --> 00:26:18,556
then I'll be willing to help you.

237
00:26:24,092 --> 00:26:25,260
Put some clothes on.

238
00:26:32,058 --> 00:26:33,476
Is that the regular report?

239
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,561
Yeah...

240
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,729
A fog is forming.

241
00:26:37,397 --> 00:26:38,731
According to the unit
we're taking over for,

242
00:26:38,731 --> 00:26:41,025
it's apparently created by
the Three-Tails.

243
00:26:41,526 --> 00:26:43,570
It induces hallucinations, so be careful.

244
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,592
That's news to me, hmm...

245
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,910
You! That costume...

246
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:52,680
Dam--!

247
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,466
Humph...

248
00:27:02,672 --> 00:27:05,758
Oh wow! Deidara Senpai,
that was awesome!

249
00:27:05,967 --> 00:27:08,011
That's the last of the lookouts.

250
00:27:11,128 --> 00:27:12,421
H-H-Hey, Senpai!

251
00:27:12,765 --> 00:27:15,101
Weren't you listening to the story
about the hallucinations?

252
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,270
Who do you think you're speaking to?

253
00:27:17,395 --> 00:27:19,397
Don't underestimate my art.

254
00:27:23,905 --> 00:27:26,741
Sheesh, he's got a short temper...

255
00:27:28,985 --> 00:27:33,614
That's a huge lake to find
the Three-Tails in.

256
00:27:35,288 --> 00:27:37,832
It'd be faster if it appeared on its own.

257
00:27:52,263 --> 00:27:57,477
Oh! On closer inspection,
it looks something like a huge turtle.

258
00:27:57,518 --> 00:27:58,853
A powerful one...

259
00:27:59,967 --> 00:28:01,218
So that's the Three-Tails...

260
00:28:01,594 --> 00:28:05,181
I think I'll leave it for you to handle,
Deidara Senpai.

261
00:28:05,533 --> 00:28:09,496
Tobi, you formally became
a member of Akatsuki, right?

262
00:28:09,993 --> 00:28:12,245
You take care of the rest, hmm!

263
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:14,035
No way...

264
00:28:24,671 --> 00:28:26,381
It's coming!

265
00:28:27,578 --> 00:28:32,124
If it's a water creature,
shouldn't we have let Kisame handle it?!

266
00:28:32,402 --> 00:28:34,946
I'd say they assigned
the wrong person for the job!

267
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:58,955
Pitiful, I'd say.

268
00:29:17,307 --> 00:29:18,308
Now!

269
00:29:30,278 --> 00:29:32,155
The Great Naruto Bridge?

270
00:29:32,405 --> 00:29:33,948
What a weird name...

271
00:29:37,327 --> 00:29:40,580
Say, was the great Zabuza Senpai strong?

272
00:29:41,956 --> 00:29:43,291
What's the matter, Sasuke?

273
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:47,553
Nothing. Let's go.

274
00:29:51,341 --> 00:29:55,178
I did it! Banzai! Banzaai!

275
00:29:55,582 --> 00:30:00,045
Deidara, did you see my jutsu?!
Just one time, and bam!

276
00:30:00,516 --> 00:30:03,920
You can understand why
I was given this important assignment

277
00:30:03,945 --> 00:30:07,448
right after formally becoming a member
of Akatsuki, can't you?!

278
00:30:08,012 --> 00:30:11,682
No...It was probably my clay bomb
doing its artistic work.

279
00:30:12,028 --> 00:30:14,906
You have my artistry to thank, hmm.

280
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:18,948
Don't get so carried away that
you forgot that I lent you a hand!

281
00:30:19,441 --> 00:30:23,946
If you're a member of Akatsuki,
don't talk so much and act more cool.

282
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:28,002
In other words, "cool = art"!

283
00:30:29,963 --> 00:30:35,763
Listen, art is a passionate moment
coming from cool emotions--!

284
00:30:35,788 --> 00:30:37,873
Senpai, you talk a lot.

285
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,601
I was joking...!

286
00:30:46,999 --> 00:30:50,503
As long as I have this blade,
I won't even lose to you...maybe.

287
00:30:52,318 --> 00:30:55,154
So? Which way do we go? Oh wait...

288
00:30:55,495 --> 00:30:59,624
The nearest route, right?
That would be your answer.

289
00:31:00,376 --> 00:31:02,211
I'm starting to figure you out...

290
00:31:04,361 --> 00:31:06,989
Right, the nearest route.

291
00:31:10,211 --> 00:31:11,462
Listen, Tobi.

292
00:31:11,691 --> 00:31:13,192
You shouldn't press your luck!

293
00:31:14,781 --> 00:31:18,118
The Three-Tails was just weak
because it didn't have a Jinchuriki host.

294
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:21,338
It didn't have a mind to control its power.

295
00:31:28,969 --> 00:31:29,970
Hey, Tobi.

296
00:31:30,231 --> 00:31:33,109
You don't have to be so cool
as to stop talking altogether.

297
00:31:33,327 --> 00:31:34,495
At least answer me...

298
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:35,800
Hmm?!

299
00:31:36,736 --> 00:31:40,865
Oh that's the spot...

300
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:43,168
Oh my...

301
00:31:46,062 --> 00:31:49,357
This is the perfect wake up
for you, I'd say. You bastard!

302
00:31:56,899 --> 00:31:59,026
Just because Orochimaru
is dead doesn't mean

303
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:00,970
I'll let you have your way!

304
00:32:03,097 --> 00:32:06,559
<i>The feeling of this chakra...
I-It can't be...</i>

305
00:32:11,867 --> 00:32:13,660
Can I ask you something?

306
00:32:13,833 --> 00:32:14,622
What is it?

307
00:32:15,193 --> 00:32:17,111
Why are you gathering men?

308
00:32:17,945 --> 00:32:19,864
I have a goal...

309
00:32:20,281 --> 00:32:24,243
And I have a better chance of
achieving it with a small platoon.

310
00:32:25,286 --> 00:32:29,585
Ever since I approached Orochimaru,
this moment is all I've thought about,

311
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:32,321
and I've been pre-selecting
highly skilled ninja.

312
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,655
Oh...?

313
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:40,426
So...why would you choose Karin?

314
00:32:40,818 --> 00:32:44,363
Unlike me,
she's a follower of Orochimaru...

315
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:48,350
After claiming to be
under Orochimaru's orders,

316
00:32:48,438 --> 00:32:51,149
she tinkered with
my body countless times.

317
00:32:51,622 --> 00:32:54,625
Besides, her personality turns me off.

318
00:32:55,354 --> 00:32:59,817
Granted, there were other strong ninja
I could have swayed.

319
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:05,127
But she has a special power
no one else possesses.

320
00:33:05,535 --> 00:33:08,371
Well...I'll admit that.

321
00:33:35,508 --> 00:33:37,427
You have one too.

322
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,852
That one is more suitable.

323
00:33:45,662 --> 00:33:47,497
Open sesame!

324
00:34:08,539 --> 00:34:11,626
So it's you, after all...Sasuke.

325
00:34:14,842 --> 00:34:20,139
The fact that you're here alone
must mean that the rumors were true.

326
00:34:21,193 --> 00:34:23,946
Geez, that's mean. I'm here too.

327
00:34:24,728 --> 00:34:26,814
And? What brings you here?

328
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,162
Sasuke has something
to discuss with you.

329
00:34:31,492 --> 00:34:35,251
We can't stand out here and talk,
so take us inside, will you?

330
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:38,753
It's been so long since I've walked...
I'm exhausted.

331
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:42,006
What do you want to talk about?

332
00:34:42,886 --> 00:34:47,307
I said let's not stand out here, Karin.

333
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:51,015
Although I know
you're totally ignoring me.

334
00:34:51,086 --> 00:34:51,806
Humph!

335
00:34:53,807 --> 00:34:55,309
You disgust me.

336
00:34:55,436 --> 00:34:57,021
What'd you say?

337
00:34:57,813 --> 00:35:01,400
Cut it out, Karin. Take us inside.

338
00:35:04,017 --> 00:35:05,561
Fine.

339
00:35:15,998 --> 00:35:19,210
Karin, follow me. I need you.

340
00:35:19,513 --> 00:35:24,601
Huh?! Why would I follow you?
I'm under orders to oversee this place!

341
00:35:25,341 --> 00:35:27,134
Orochimaru is already gone.

342
00:35:27,394 --> 00:35:29,521
What about the prisoners here?

343
00:35:30,219 --> 00:35:34,807
Suigetsu...Release everyone
who is held prisoner here.

344
00:35:34,961 --> 00:35:35,663
Wha--?!

345
00:35:36,143 --> 00:35:40,189
Geez...You always
order people around.

346
00:35:41,482 --> 00:35:43,275
You can't just come here
and take over!

347
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:45,986
You don't know what it took
to keep things in order here...

348
00:35:46,028 --> 00:35:49,699
Without prisoners,
there won't be any need for a warden.

349
00:35:50,741 --> 00:35:54,203
I'll say it once more.
Come with me, Karin.

350
00:35:58,165 --> 00:36:01,544
Well, anyway,
I'll go and release the prisoners.

351
00:36:04,354 --> 00:36:06,565
I refuse! Besides...

352
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,592
I'm under no obligation to follow you!

353
00:36:13,344 --> 00:36:14,470
Too bad...

354
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:19,103
Since you seem dead set against it,
I'll just ask someone else.

355
00:36:28,028 --> 00:36:29,447
I knew it!

356
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:33,576
The rumors that Sasuke Uchiha
brought down Orochimaru were true!

357
00:36:33,909 --> 00:36:35,411
Yeah, it's true.

358
00:36:35,837 --> 00:36:37,839
What'll happen to those of us in here?

359
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,288
Of course, you're free to go.

360
00:36:41,208 --> 00:36:42,668
A-Are you sure?!

361
00:36:43,544 --> 00:36:49,800
Yeah...I was once imprisoned too.
But as you can see, I'm free.

362
00:36:54,080 --> 00:37:00,378
I'm going to unlock the cells.
Before that, I have one favor to ask.

363
00:37:00,827 --> 00:37:02,912
What is it?! Ask us anything!

364
00:37:03,516 --> 00:37:04,364
Well...

365
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:10,321
The one who defeated Orochimaru
and gave us our freedom is Sasuke.

366
00:37:10,946 --> 00:37:13,282
When you're out,
spread the word to everyone...

367
00:37:13,908 --> 00:37:18,788
A man has appeared who will
bring peace and tranquility to this world.

368
00:37:21,763 --> 00:37:22,603
I'm coming.

369
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:44,087
Since you're so adamant...

370
00:37:45,107 --> 00:37:46,775
I'll go with you.

371
00:37:47,784 --> 00:37:52,038
What's this?
That was a quick change of heart.

372
00:37:52,595 --> 00:37:54,681
After thinking it over,

373
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:56,958
I realized I'm tired of
guarding this place.

374
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:08,574
It's locked from the inside...

375
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:11,144
That woman!

376
00:38:13,476 --> 00:38:14,728
That's Suigetsu.

377
00:38:15,553 --> 00:38:19,723
Let's forget about that nuisance,
okay, Sasuke?

378
00:38:19,821 --> 00:38:22,366
You...Don't get so close.

379
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:26,391
Look...what's wrong with
just you and me?

380
00:38:26,779 --> 00:38:29,256
We don't need a guy like...Suigetsu.

381
00:38:37,991 --> 00:38:40,244
Hope my blade isn't chipped...

382
00:38:41,029 --> 00:38:45,075
Let's go, Sasuke.
Karin turned you down, didn't she?

383
00:38:45,755 --> 00:38:48,508
No. It seems she's coming.

384
00:38:48,792 --> 00:38:50,961
Wh-Who said I'm coming?!

385
00:38:50,986 --> 00:38:55,490
I just...I just happened to be
going in the same direction.

386
00:38:55,515 --> 00:38:59,311
That's all, nothing else...!

387
00:38:59,975 --> 00:39:04,647
Oh, how nice.
Then we can travel together partway.

388
00:39:05,156 --> 00:39:07,074
Yeah, just part of the way!

389
00:39:11,209 --> 00:39:13,795
All right...Next is Jugo.

390
00:39:14,122 --> 00:39:16,625
What? You're going to see Jugo?

391
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:20,646
That shouldn't concern you since
you're just coming with us part of the way.

392
00:39:20,671 --> 00:39:23,382
Sure, I could care less,
but what's wrong with asking?

393
00:39:23,407 --> 00:39:24,908
Wanna make something of it,
you jerk?!

394
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:26,953
Let's go!

395
00:39:27,357 --> 00:39:29,067
Y-Yeah...

396
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:32,629
We have to walk again?

397
00:39:33,547 --> 00:39:35,215
I'm exhausted.

398
00:39:36,133 --> 00:39:39,606
Humph...We're going to
the northern hideout now.

399
00:39:39,631 --> 00:39:42,134
At this rate, you'll be killed
the moment we get there.

400
00:39:42,477 --> 00:39:46,446
I only know it through maps...
but is the place really that bad?

401
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:50,222
The northern hideout
is no ordinary hideout.

402
00:39:52,896 --> 00:39:54,314
That place...

403
00:39:54,443 --> 00:39:56,362
is where human experiments
are conducted.

404
00:39:56,946 --> 00:40:02,201
And the unmanageable monsters that
result are kept locked up there.

405
00:40:03,911 --> 00:40:04,995
A male...

406
00:40:05,747 --> 00:40:09,375
No, a female.

407
00:40:10,532 --> 00:40:13,952
No, I'll kill a male next, after all.

408
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:17,999
I see.

409
00:40:19,077 --> 00:40:20,912
It's already begun...

410
00:40:32,481 --> 00:40:34,900
Say, aren't you tired?

411
00:40:35,526 --> 00:40:37,361
How about a short break?

412
00:40:37,444 --> 00:40:39,697
You're already taking a break!

413
00:40:39,889 --> 00:40:42,267
You are so hopeless!

414
00:40:42,377 --> 00:40:44,713
We've still got a ways to go 'til
we get to the northern hideout!

415
00:40:44,827 --> 00:40:47,287
My destination is different
from yours.

416
00:40:47,746 --> 00:40:51,166
No need to bother with me.
Just go on ahead.

417
00:40:51,291 --> 00:40:54,169
I remembered that I too have business
at the northern hideout!

418
00:40:54,194 --> 00:40:56,446
So I'm going to take care of that first!

419
00:40:58,507 --> 00:41:01,427
I don't know what your goals are...

420
00:41:01,672 --> 00:41:04,809
But you want me to join your team
despite knowing about Jugo?

421
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:09,796
I know him a little.
We fought each other once.

422
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:14,106
He had an unusual ability
and was quite formidable.

423
00:41:14,606 --> 00:41:17,175
But I couldn't figure out
what he was thinking,

424
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,868
and I didn't really like him.

425
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:22,990
I understand he sought out
Orochimaru.

426
00:41:23,907 --> 00:41:25,576
He's got to be crazy.

427
00:41:28,037 --> 00:41:29,955
According to rumors,

428
00:41:29,997 --> 00:41:33,375
Jugo usually has that
unusual impulse well under control.

429
00:41:33,917 --> 00:41:36,336
But when he loses it,
he transforms into a ruthless killer.

430
00:41:36,336 --> 00:41:39,006
His personality and appearance
change completely.

431
00:41:40,775 --> 00:41:44,529
In other words, he's a maniac
who loves to kill people.

432
00:41:44,689 --> 00:41:49,444
But to Orochimaru,
Jugo's ability was enticing.

433
00:41:49,992 --> 00:41:52,161
He invented an enzyme,
based on Jugo's body fluids,

434
00:41:52,186 --> 00:41:56,315
which induced the same condition
in other shinobi.

435
00:41:57,399 --> 00:41:58,942
You guys know it too, right?

436
00:42:03,982 --> 00:42:07,402
That's...the Curse Mark.

437
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:10,245
Jugo is the one and only
original carrier.

438
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:15,584
I'm getting out of here!
I'll kill anyone who tries to stop me!

439
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:18,504
Who's...next?

440
00:42:21,632 --> 00:42:24,676
Say, can we rest a bit?

441
00:42:24,831 --> 00:42:28,167
Suigetsu! You keep stopping to rest!

442
00:42:28,472 --> 00:42:29,973
We're almost at the hideout!

443
00:42:30,188 --> 00:42:33,483
Is it the sword?
Is it too heavy for you?

444
00:42:33,852 --> 00:42:35,938
Then leave it, damn it!

445
00:42:36,318 --> 00:42:38,362
Tell him, Sasuke!

446
00:42:43,529 --> 00:42:44,344
What's wrong?

447
00:42:44,822 --> 00:42:46,824
Where's the guy who's on watch?

448
00:42:47,032 --> 00:42:47,624
Huh?

449
00:42:49,201 --> 00:42:52,037
You're right...That's strange.

450
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:53,771
Hey...

451
00:43:09,768 --> 00:43:12,688
He's from the northern hideout.
He's still breathing.

452
00:43:13,055 --> 00:43:14,202
What happened?

453
00:43:16,228 --> 00:43:19,273
Y-You're...Sasuke Uchiha...

454
00:43:20,232 --> 00:43:21,441
Help me...

455
00:43:22,109 --> 00:43:23,610
What happened?

456
00:43:24,111 --> 00:43:26,256
I-It all started...

457
00:43:26,281 --> 00:43:29,868
with the rumors that
Orochimaru was dead.

458
00:43:31,552 --> 00:43:34,013
The prisoners went wild...

459
00:43:34,746 --> 00:43:35,998
At this rate...

460
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:41,628
Oh dear...He died.

461
00:43:53,557 --> 00:43:55,350
You're...

462
00:43:55,726 --> 00:43:57,269
What is that?

463
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:00,814
He's already in the
"Curse Mark Second State."

464
00:44:13,704 --> 00:44:15,331
The northern hideout is over there.

465
00:44:15,829 --> 00:44:17,748
Let's go and see Jugo.

466
00:44:20,334 --> 00:44:23,629
Huh? Hey! Wait, Sasuke!

467
00:44:29,718 --> 00:44:30,719
A male...

468
00:44:32,054 --> 00:44:34,848
The next one I kill
will be a guy, after all...

469
00:44:36,278 --> 00:44:38,154
The guards have all been killed...

470
00:44:39,263 --> 00:44:41,265
and the prisoners have escaped.

471
00:44:41,691 --> 00:44:44,569
Then there's no way
we can tell which one is Jugo...

472
00:44:45,108 --> 00:44:46,109
Eh, Sasuke?

473
00:44:46,276 --> 00:44:49,613
Karin, is Jugo among them?

474
00:44:50,072 --> 00:44:53,617
Cripes, what a pain!
Just wait a bit!

475
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:06,922
Nope, he's not.

476
00:45:07,256 --> 00:45:10,092
Well then, I can fight without
worrying who they are.

477
00:45:11,093 --> 00:45:12,636
Just avoid killing them.

478
00:45:15,681 --> 00:45:18,308
You're from the Hidden Leaf,
after all...

479
00:45:18,642 --> 00:45:21,436
You should've killed that
guy back there too, you know.

480
00:45:21,812 --> 00:45:23,105
So naïve...

481
00:45:24,606 --> 00:45:25,607
Let's go.

482
00:45:31,196 --> 00:45:32,614
All right, decided.

483
00:45:33,657 --> 00:45:36,868
If the next one who comes
through that door is a woman,

484
00:45:38,249 --> 00:45:39,959
I'll kill her.

485
00:45:49,715 --> 00:45:53,176
You're strong...You're...

486
00:45:59,391 --> 00:46:00,392
The keys!

487
00:46:01,018 --> 00:46:02,311
I found them!

488
00:46:09,212 --> 00:46:12,632
Karin, which way?
Lead the way.

489
00:46:13,046 --> 00:46:16,466
Sasuke!
Why're you ordering me around, huh?!

490
00:46:16,909 --> 00:46:19,787
Can you just hurry and check?

491
00:46:20,102 --> 00:46:22,646
That's the ability you
pride yourself on, right?

492
00:46:25,459 --> 00:46:26,543
That way!

493
00:46:39,969 --> 00:46:40,970
What is it?

494
00:46:41,725 --> 00:46:43,393
Actually, it's this way.

495
00:46:43,935 --> 00:46:45,312
Let's go, Sasuke!

496
00:46:45,742 --> 00:46:48,995
Why did you lie? Suigetsu went...

497
00:46:49,191 --> 00:46:51,318
Suigetsu has a big mouth,
that's why I don't like him.

498
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:53,229
Let's go!

499
00:46:54,225 --> 00:46:56,644
Let go...I can walk on my own.

500
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:04,897
So...the Curse Mark really does transform
the body into such an ugly shape...

501
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:09,337
Sasuke, does your Curse Mark
do the same to you?

502
00:47:10,295 --> 00:47:13,215
Sasuke...Are you listening...?

503
00:47:18,924 --> 00:47:20,801
That witch...!

504
00:47:25,185 --> 00:47:26,269
Here?

505
00:47:26,686 --> 00:47:28,897
Yeah, Jugo's inside.

506
00:47:35,404 --> 00:47:36,405
There...

507
00:47:40,613 --> 00:47:42,740
Now then, which will it be?

508
00:47:43,002 --> 00:47:45,088
All right! I'm gonna open it!

509
00:47:52,879 --> 00:47:56,925
I'll go in first. Karin, stay back.

510
00:47:57,217 --> 00:47:58,802
S-Sure!

511
00:48:00,935 --> 00:48:01,679
No...

512
00:48:04,391 --> 00:48:08,854
It's gotta be a guy.
If it's a guy, I'll kill him.

513
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:13,417
Bingo! I'm gonna kill!

514
00:48:14,985 --> 00:48:15,986
He's coming!

515
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,290
It's not over yet!

516
00:48:44,931 --> 00:48:46,600
<i>Sasuke's chakra...</i>

517
00:48:57,819 --> 00:48:58,904
...changed!

518
00:49:04,409 --> 00:49:06,786
Not another copy of me...!

519
00:49:07,266 --> 00:49:11,270
But you're quite a guy to be able to do
a Partial Transformation!

520
00:49:14,794 --> 00:49:16,963
You're good at controlling
your Curse Mark!

521
00:49:17,506 --> 00:49:21,510
He's strong! Haven't seen a copycat
this good since Kimimaro.

522
00:49:25,805 --> 00:49:27,557
I have no intention of fighting.

523
00:49:30,018 --> 00:49:33,188
I only wish to talk to you, Jugo.

524
00:49:34,397 --> 00:49:35,440
Talk...?!

525
00:49:36,066 --> 00:49:38,693
I'm getting you out of here.

526
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:40,779
Get me out of here?!

527
00:49:44,157 --> 00:49:47,410
Are you crazy?! Without him...

528
00:49:48,161 --> 00:49:49,538
Without him...

529
00:49:50,372 --> 00:49:54,584
I can't...leave this place.

530
00:49:59,589 --> 00:50:00,590
What?!

531
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:06,763
You're using a different technique
than before, Jugo. It's solid.

532
00:50:06,788 --> 00:50:08,081
Stop it, Suigetsu.

533
00:50:08,576 --> 00:50:09,869
That's right!

534
00:50:09,894 --> 00:50:13,064
You're Suigetsu. I remember now.

535
00:50:13,752 --> 00:50:15,379
We didn't come here to fight.

536
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,180
Let me talk to him.

537
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:20,364
I doubt that anything
you say will get through to him.

538
00:50:20,819 --> 00:50:23,113
You just have to take him by force!

539
00:50:28,936 --> 00:50:30,104
Stop it, both of you!

540
00:50:30,453 --> 00:50:32,581
<i>Keep going! Just kill each other off!</i>

541
00:50:36,251 --> 00:50:38,878
Do you both...want me to kill you?

542
00:50:56,772 --> 00:50:59,900
<i>Just now...that was real bloodthirst.</i>

543
00:51:00,733 --> 00:51:03,903
<i>Y-You're irresistible...Sasuke...</i>

544
00:51:23,175 --> 00:51:26,262
H-Hurry up and lock me in!

545
00:51:26,732 --> 00:51:30,402
Jugo...I only came to free you.

546
00:51:31,222 --> 00:51:32,599
Come with me.

547
00:51:33,058 --> 00:51:34,684
He's too scared.

548
00:51:34,917 --> 00:51:37,419
No...That's not it.

549
00:51:40,482 --> 00:51:43,693
I don't want to kill anymore people.

550
00:51:43,718 --> 00:51:47,472
I don't want to go outside...
Leave me alone!

551
00:51:47,697 --> 00:51:51,284
What is this?
Talk about split personality...

552
00:51:51,451 --> 00:51:57,040
I told you so...
Jugo has this uncontrollable urge to kill.

553
00:51:57,883 --> 00:51:59,950
He's unable to suppress the urge

554
00:52:00,752 --> 00:52:03,088
even though he really doesn't want
to kill people.

555
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:07,373
I don't know when
I'll kill someone again.

556
00:52:07,632 --> 00:52:09,467
So just put the lock on!

557
00:52:10,191 --> 00:52:12,860
See, this guy is dangerous, Sasuke.

558
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:17,600
I can't even walk in front of him
without getting nervous.

559
00:52:18,287 --> 00:52:22,236
What's with you guys?!
Just leave me alone!

560
00:52:30,499 --> 00:52:32,084
Orochimaru is dead.

561
00:52:33,198 --> 00:52:35,033
And this hideout has been destroyed.

562
00:52:35,548 --> 00:52:37,383
If you stay here, you'll die as well.

563
00:52:37,751 --> 00:52:42,298
That's fine with me...
I don't want to kill anyone ever again!

564
00:52:43,382 --> 00:52:47,052
Don't worry...
I will become your cage.

565
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:50,258
I will stop you.

566
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:54,161
What can you do?

567
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:58,268
The only one who can make
these urges stop is Kimimaro.

568
00:52:59,626 --> 00:53:02,545
Without Kimimaro, I won't leave!

569
00:53:04,393 --> 00:53:07,855
Kimimaro? You mean
of the Kaguya clan...?

570
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:13,107
Yeah...Jugo and Kimimaro were
especially favored by Orochimaru.

571
00:53:13,706 --> 00:53:16,375
They were kept together in this hideout
for human experiments

572
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,818
for a long time.

573
00:53:18,921 --> 00:53:20,798
Plus, Kimimaro was strong...

574
00:53:21,397 --> 00:53:24,025
Jugo was valuable for
human experiments

575
00:53:24,133 --> 00:53:28,345
and Kimimaro was the only one able to
stop Jugo's rampages without hurting him.

576
00:53:29,257 --> 00:53:32,469
But I thought that guy was already...

577
00:53:33,152 --> 00:53:33,945
Yeah...

578
00:53:34,095 --> 00:53:37,098
Jugo...Kimimaro died for my sake.

579
00:53:38,268 --> 00:53:39,394
He's no longer here.

580
00:53:43,315 --> 00:53:45,109
Died for your sake?!

581
00:53:46,981 --> 00:53:48,441
Then you're...

582
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:52,186
Sasuke Uchiha...?

583
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:53,781
Yes.

584
00:53:54,977 --> 00:53:55,978
Sasuke...

585
00:53:57,298 --> 00:53:58,340
Uchiha...

586
00:53:59,075 --> 00:54:01,744
Why are you being sent out?
You're sick!

587
00:54:02,226 --> 00:54:03,936
This has never happened before...

588
00:54:04,334 --> 00:54:05,794
Sasuke Uchiha...

589
00:54:07,049 --> 00:54:10,636
The man who is taking my place
as Lord Orochimaru's vessel...

590
00:54:11,533 --> 00:54:13,827
It's to bring him in.

591
00:54:14,213 --> 00:54:16,465
Is he worth going that far?

592
00:54:17,341 --> 00:54:19,594
If you take me out of the running
as a vessel,

593
00:54:19,619 --> 00:54:22,372
then there is no one else.

594
00:54:23,571 --> 00:54:26,282
He is like my reincarnation.

595
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:29,975
I will risk my life to bring him here.

596
00:54:31,156 --> 00:54:33,950
I'm grateful to you, Jugo.

597
00:54:34,989 --> 00:54:37,742
Your power made me much stronger.

598
00:54:38,931 --> 00:54:42,101
Well Jugo...I'll be back again.

599
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:55,329
<i>Is that how it is...Kimimaro.</i>

600
00:55:09,249 --> 00:55:12,705
<i>That's pretty heavy food
to have in the morning.</i>

601
00:55:13,714 --> 00:55:18,594
Sakura, today's our day off.
How come you're up so early?

602
00:55:19,617 --> 00:55:21,160
It's already noon.

603
00:55:21,911 --> 00:55:23,121
Well, never mind.

604
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:27,324
Just wash up quickly and get dressed.
I'll be waiting.

605
00:55:27,876 --> 00:55:29,229
Huh? Is it a date?

606
00:55:29,277 --> 00:55:31,737
Idiot! Lady Tsunade has summoned us!

607
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:33,840
You're late!

608
00:55:34,007 --> 00:55:36,134
What took you two so long?! Cripes!

609
00:55:38,086 --> 00:55:40,338
What's wrong, Granny Tsunade?

610
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:42,704
Don't you have something
to talk about?

611
00:55:43,933 --> 00:55:44,934
Well...

612
00:55:45,476 --> 00:55:49,814
There's certain information that is
being spread throughout the region...

613
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,311
It's about that.

614
00:55:52,887 --> 00:55:54,013
Information?

615
00:55:54,465 --> 00:55:56,592
What? What about?

616
00:56:00,224 --> 00:56:01,934
Orochimaru is dead.

617
00:56:05,027 --> 00:56:07,738
It seems Sasuke Uchiha killed him.

618
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:18,472
Is...

619
00:56:19,093 --> 00:56:22,180
Is that...true?

620
00:56:23,156 --> 00:56:28,786
There's no mistake about it.
I heard it from a reliable source.

621
00:56:34,442 --> 00:56:36,569
Then...

622
00:56:39,917 --> 00:56:43,421
Heh! After all, there's no way
he'd get killed by Orochimaru!

623
00:56:43,785 --> 00:56:48,498
That means Sasuke will be coming back
to the Hidden Leaf! Right?

624
00:56:56,403 --> 00:56:59,239
That doesn't seem to be the case...

625
00:57:01,961 --> 00:57:03,003
Now...

626
00:57:03,179 --> 00:57:05,556
I have all the members I had in mind.

627
00:57:06,794 --> 00:57:09,046
So I will tell you my goal.

628
00:57:13,629 --> 00:57:17,799
My goal is to kill Itachi Uchiha
of the Akatsuki.

629
00:57:18,316 --> 00:57:19,859
Thought so...

630
00:57:22,101 --> 00:57:25,271
<i>Itachi Uchiha...?
But that's his brother!</i>

631
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:28,226
And I want to borrow
your strength for that.

632
00:57:28,901 --> 00:57:30,694
Naturally, I won't force you.

633
00:57:31,242 --> 00:57:34,370
Karin...You said you had business
to take care of.

634
00:57:34,985 --> 00:57:35,986
What will you do?

635
00:57:36,321 --> 00:57:41,618
W-Well...On second thought,
it's not that urgent...

636
00:57:41,729 --> 00:57:44,815
Karin...Be honest with yourself.

637
00:57:45,509 --> 00:57:49,305
Isn't being with Sasuke
all you really want?

638
00:57:49,436 --> 00:57:54,316
Th-That's not true!
Whoever said such a thing?

639
00:57:54,439 --> 00:57:55,154
That's...! I...!!

640
00:57:55,492 --> 00:57:57,161
See, I hit it right on the mark.

641
00:57:57,414 --> 00:58:00,751
That's why you're speechless.
So obvious.

642
00:58:01,312 --> 00:58:02,980
I know all about it...

643
00:58:03,152 --> 00:58:05,446
Long ago...
you had a crush on Sasuke...

644
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:10,177
Suigetsu, don't get Karin so worked up...

645
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:12,768
I thought I told you to be cooperative.

646
00:58:13,928 --> 00:58:17,890
All right...Sorry, Karin.

647
00:58:18,414 --> 00:58:20,457
But as much as you hate it...

648
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,803
I'm sticking to Sasuke like glue.

649
00:58:24,565 --> 00:58:29,320
At least until I possess one
of the Seven Hidden Mist Blades...

650
00:58:29,361 --> 00:58:33,741
Kisame Hoshigaki's
Great Shark Fin sword.

651
00:58:34,461 --> 00:58:37,547
So you're just sword collecting?
How lame...

652
00:58:39,468 --> 00:58:40,510
Suigetsu...

653
00:58:40,943 --> 00:58:44,113
I know. Jugo, what about you?

654
00:58:45,239 --> 00:58:48,910
Kimimaro used to say that
you were his reincarnation, Sasuke...

655
00:58:48,951 --> 00:58:50,703
And he bet his life to protect you.

656
00:58:52,322 --> 00:58:56,772
So I want to see with my own eyes
just how great of a ninja you are.

657
00:59:00,256 --> 00:59:01,299
Then it's all set!

658
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,379
What's the matter with him?

659
00:59:08,594 --> 00:59:12,590
Orochimaru is dead,
so why isn't he returning to the village?

660
00:59:13,073 --> 00:59:15,618
Sasuke is possessed by
the desire for revenge.

661
00:59:16,401 --> 00:59:21,181
He intends to approach the Akatsuki
in order to kill his older brother Itachi.

662
00:59:22,026 --> 00:59:25,696
That guy!
Is he still...? Dammit!

663
00:59:29,494 --> 00:59:31,997
From this point on, we move together.

664
00:59:32,495 --> 00:59:36,541
And henceforth,
we will call ourselves...Hebi.

665
00:59:36,932 --> 00:59:39,143
Well, let's get going.

666
00:59:39,643 --> 00:59:42,521
Operation "Track Akatsuki"
is still ongoing, right?

667
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:43,693
Yes...

668
00:59:44,049 --> 00:59:48,886
If we hunt down that
Akatsuki member first

669
00:59:49,072 --> 00:59:50,822
we'll definitely run into
Sasuke eventually!

670
00:59:50,847 --> 00:59:53,057
Hebi has but one objective...

671
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:55,351
In other words, our target is...

672
00:59:55,602 --> 00:59:56,645
Itachi...

673
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:57,827
Uchiha!

674
01:00:36,477 --> 01:00:37,728
<i>Corrosion Style:</i>

675
01:00:37,810 --> 01:00:39,735
<i>Scorching Rocks Jutsu!</i>

676
01:00:48,033 --> 01:00:51,244
This isn't a case of
mistaken identity I take it…

677
01:00:52,387 --> 01:00:55,515
My weaknesses have already been
carefully researched.

678
01:00:57,464 --> 01:00:59,675
So now, how will you deal with this?

679
01:01:03,044 --> 01:01:04,712
He turned his body into lava?!

680
01:01:05,296 --> 01:01:08,382
He's trickier than I thought.

681
01:01:09,083 --> 01:01:11,919
<i>Water Style:
Giant Exploding Water Shock Wave.</i>

682
01:01:19,435 --> 01:01:21,562
He's not all talk either.

683
01:01:21,938 --> 01:01:26,045
I wish you'd just allow yourself
to be captured without all this fuss.

684
01:01:28,819 --> 01:01:30,529
What a pain.

685
01:01:43,477 --> 01:01:44,478
You're back.

686
01:01:44,935 --> 01:01:47,897
Yeah, but having to bring him back
without killing him,

687
01:01:48,062 --> 01:01:49,855
was quite a bother.

688
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:02,136
It's starting to rain.

689
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:03,788
Looks like it'll storm.

690
01:02:04,873 --> 01:02:07,125
Let's take cover under a tree,

691
01:02:07,503 --> 01:02:09,380
or we'll catch a cold.

692
01:02:09,691 --> 01:02:11,985
Leader is waiting for word that
we've captured him.

693
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:14,799
Immediately thereafter,

694
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:17,927
the sealing of the Three-Tails
and Four-Tails is to occur simultaneously.

695
01:02:18,519 --> 01:02:21,564
So we make him wait a little.

696
01:02:21,806 --> 01:02:26,936
Once the sealing begins,
we'll be working for quite some time.

697
01:02:33,473 --> 01:02:34,808
He seems near death.

698
01:02:35,397 --> 01:02:36,940
You must handle the elderly
with care.

699
01:02:37,488 --> 01:02:40,825
You say that because
you don't know him.

700
01:02:41,075 --> 01:02:44,328
This Jinchuriki who uses the
Corrosion Style Jutsu of the Four-Tails

701
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:46,288
isn't what you think.

702
01:02:46,916 --> 01:02:49,168
You didn't fight him yourself,

703
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:51,919
so you wouldn't understand
what I went through.

704
01:02:57,061 --> 01:03:01,774
But, I was the one who asked
to go alone.

705
01:03:02,266 --> 01:03:06,312
Say, want me to beat
your assignment half-dead too?

706
01:03:07,032 --> 01:03:09,368
Don't get so excited, Kisame.

707
01:03:10,039 --> 01:03:12,207
Well, I'm a bit tired, you see.

708
01:03:12,423 --> 01:03:16,052
I wish we could catch all
the Tailed Beasts already.

709
01:03:16,679 --> 01:03:21,017
Don't be so impatient...
It's going to take some time.

710
01:03:21,835 --> 01:03:26,006
I wonder about that.
There's just a few more, right?

711
01:03:26,715 --> 01:03:30,469
And it's been decided that
the Nine-Tails will be sealed last...

712
01:03:30,956 --> 01:03:33,041
Otherwise, the balance
will be disrupted,

713
01:03:33,066 --> 01:03:34,901
and the sealing statue
will be pulverized...

714
01:03:34,926 --> 01:03:37,011
That's what Leader said...

715
01:03:37,865 --> 01:03:40,868
After all, the Jinchuriki need
to be captured alive.

716
01:03:41,387 --> 01:03:45,683
So I say just catch them quickly
and leave them tied up.

717
01:03:46,328 --> 01:03:51,250
Humph...Fine with me,
but remember that Deidara failed.

718
01:03:52,171 --> 01:03:55,549
If he's going to be sealed last, it's
no big deal if we capture him last.

719
01:03:56,933 --> 01:03:59,478
And besides, Akatsuki is becoming
too conspicuous lately.

720
01:04:00,429 --> 01:04:03,140
If we capture the Nine-Tails' Jinchuriki
too soon,

721
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,186
the Hidden Leaf will become
even more of a nuisance.

722
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:08,601
Heh...You really think so?

723
01:04:09,438 --> 01:04:13,734
The Hidden Leaf Village has
very strong links with other villages.

724
01:04:14,389 --> 01:04:17,601
If they begin to collaborate,
it will be difficult for us to act.

725
01:04:18,422 --> 01:04:21,133
It will be wiser to collect up
to the Eight-Tails

726
01:04:21,158 --> 01:04:22,910
with as little commotion as possible.

727
01:04:23,282 --> 01:04:26,994
I see. I guess you're right.

728
01:04:29,041 --> 01:04:30,084
There's the summons.

729
01:04:30,592 --> 01:04:32,636
We've been caught dawdling.

730
01:04:38,884 --> 01:04:39,969
<i>You're late...</i>

731
01:04:40,553 --> 01:04:44,223
<i>We had just finished catching
the Jinchuruki when you contacted us.</i>

732
01:04:44,265 --> 01:04:46,142
<i>We tied him up good to
make sure he didn't escape.</i>

733
01:04:46,142 --> 01:04:47,768
<i>That's what took us longer.</i>

734
01:04:47,832 --> 01:04:50,251
<i>So, what's up?</i>

735
01:04:50,622 --> 01:04:53,792
<i>I got an urgent message
I wanted to relay to you.</i>

736
01:04:56,777 --> 01:04:58,654
<i>Orochimaru has been killed.</i>

737
01:05:02,366 --> 01:05:04,535
<i>It's been ten years since
he deserted us...</i>

738
01:05:04,635 --> 01:05:07,888
<i>So we've been spared the trouble
of killing him ourselves.</i>

739
01:05:07,913 --> 01:05:09,582
<i>I would've loved to see him die</i>

740
01:05:09,607 --> 01:05:13,333
<i>as much as I would've loved to
see the Zombie Combo die.</i>

741
01:05:13,627 --> 01:05:15,504
<i>Hidan and Kakuzu were
our comrades.</i>

742
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:17,465
<i>Don't say such things.</i>

743
01:05:17,682 --> 01:05:21,895
<i>Sorry...Back then,
they were done in by...</i>

744
01:05:22,028 --> 01:05:24,155
<i>The Hidden Leaf.</i>

745
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:27,930
<i>The squad with Kakashi and
the Nine-Tails' Jinchuriki.</i>

746
01:05:28,267 --> 01:05:33,355
<i>They're strong, that team.
Even Deidara got his butt kicked.</i>

747
01:05:33,635 --> 01:05:34,636
<i>Tobi!!</i>

748
01:05:34,773 --> 01:05:39,737
<i>Say one more word and my patience
will run out! It will!</i>

749
01:05:40,310 --> 01:05:45,284
<i>It takes self-control to be patient...</i>

750
01:05:45,326 --> 01:05:48,829
<i>And your fuse is too short for that.</i>

751
01:05:49,067 --> 01:05:51,236
<i>Why you--! Tobi! You!</i>

752
01:05:51,624 --> 01:05:55,461
<i>Pipe down, Deidara. Tobi's right.</i>

753
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:58,461
<i>You got chewed out!</i>

754
01:05:58,486 --> 01:06:03,115
<i>But Tobi, you always talk too much.
Respect your superiors.</i>

755
01:06:03,427 --> 01:06:05,346
<i>Okay! Sorry!</i>

756
01:06:05,803 --> 01:06:09,515
<i>And we're supposed to get
the remaining Jinchuriki with these two?</i>

757
01:06:11,936 --> 01:06:17,525
<i>But killing Orochimaru took
special skill. Who did it?</i>

758
01:06:18,276 --> 01:06:19,611
<i>Sasuke Uchiha.</i>

759
01:06:21,529 --> 01:06:24,573
<i>I was gonna be the one to
bring Orochimaru down.</i>

760
01:06:25,916 --> 01:06:27,792
<i>Hmm...He's good.</i>

761
01:06:27,846 --> 01:06:30,163
<i>I'd expect nothing less from
your kid brother, Itachi.</i>

762
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:32,930
<i>He's gathering members...</i>

763
01:06:33,142 --> 01:06:35,353
<i>Really troublesome ninja at that.</i>

764
01:06:35,876 --> 01:06:37,002
<i>What do you mean?</i>

765
01:06:37,670 --> 01:06:39,463
<i>You know them well too...</i>

766
01:06:39,713 --> 01:06:43,008
<i>One of the Hozuki Brothers
of the Hidden Mist...</i>

767
01:06:43,241 --> 01:06:46,453
<i>You mean, Suigetsu?
That brings back memories.</i>

768
01:06:47,346 --> 01:06:49,306
<i>And also, Bipolar Jugo.</i>

769
01:06:49,852 --> 01:06:52,563
<i>So be on your guard,
Itachi and Kisame...</i>

770
01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:55,062
<i>I dare say they're targeting you two.</i>

771
01:06:57,356 --> 01:07:01,360
<i>And the rest of you should keep
Sasuke Uchiha in mind.</i>

772
01:07:01,902 --> 01:07:04,406
<i>After getting information
about Itachi and Kisame,</i>

773
01:07:04,431 --> 01:07:06,725
<i>they may just come after Akatsuki.</i>

774
01:07:07,324 --> 01:07:09,535
<i>Kisame, what kind of guy is he...?</i>

775
01:07:09,636 --> 01:07:11,722
<i>This Suigetsu...hmm?</i>

776
01:07:12,413 --> 01:07:14,040
<i>It happened ten years ago...</i>

777
01:07:14,132 --> 01:07:16,801
<i>He had such a cute smile.</i>

778
01:07:17,316 --> 01:07:20,719
<i>A child prodigy who's been called the
reincarnation of the demonic Zabuza.</i>

779
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:23,663
Are you a river child
who got stranded on land?!

780
01:07:24,004 --> 01:07:27,049
Quit stopping to drink water so often!

781
01:07:27,575 --> 01:07:31,704
<i>Hmm...They seem like an interesting lot.</i>

782
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:38,314
<i>Hey, don't get too interested.
And just leave me out of it!</i>

783
01:07:38,698 --> 01:07:40,825
<i>Never mind that already.
Itachi, Kisame...</i>

784
01:07:41,177 --> 01:07:43,205
<i>hurry up and get the Four-Tails.</i>

785
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:45,482
<i>We'll seal him at the same time
as the Three-Tails!</i>

786
01:07:46,261 --> 01:07:47,387
<i>Understood.</i>

787
01:07:53,579 --> 01:07:57,958
Cripes, and I thought
we'd get to rest a bit.

788
01:07:58,014 --> 01:08:00,142
We have no choice. Let's hurry.

789
01:08:04,891 --> 01:08:06,434
We target the member of Akatsuki

790
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:09,887
with whom we have
the highest chance of meeting Sasuke.

791
01:08:10,763 --> 01:08:12,598
Well, I can see the logic in that.

792
01:08:13,932 --> 01:08:17,394
Itachi Uchiha...What shall we do?

793
01:08:18,354 --> 01:08:21,440
If we're able to take just one of
the Akatsuki into custody,

794
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:26,028
Ibiki can get information about
Itachi out of him.

795
01:08:26,779 --> 01:08:28,906
I've already issued an order to
all teams to capture

796
01:08:28,947 --> 01:08:31,909
a member of Akatsuki
if the opportunity presents itself,

797
01:08:32,109 --> 01:08:34,570
and to transport him here.

798
01:08:34,995 --> 01:08:37,790
That will probably be very difficult.

799
01:08:39,557 --> 01:08:40,641
Kakashi Sensei...

800
01:08:41,085 --> 01:08:44,713
We won't be able to make them
talk so easily.

801
01:08:45,418 --> 01:08:48,254
Even those we've already encountered
were far too dangerous

802
01:08:48,279 --> 01:08:52,658
and we couldn't even think about
taking them into custody.

803
01:08:53,013 --> 01:08:55,140
Then what're we gonna do?!

804
01:08:55,516 --> 01:08:57,559
Well, until we come across Itachi,

805
01:08:57,601 --> 01:08:59,478
I don't think we have any choice
but to be very patient and search.

806
01:08:59,978 --> 01:09:03,315
Well then...
Say we find Itachi. What next?

807
01:09:04,107 --> 01:09:05,484
About that...

808
01:09:06,578 --> 01:09:10,206
I have an idea.
Can you spare some time?

809
01:09:24,044 --> 01:09:26,296
This is a big one.

810
01:09:26,972 --> 01:09:27,973
<i>So you've come...</i>

811
01:09:29,508 --> 01:09:33,429
<i>All right, we'll begin the sealing
starting with the Three-Tails.</i>

812
01:09:57,536 --> 01:10:00,247
<i>All right! Assemble.</i>

813
01:10:09,006 --> 01:10:10,257
<i>Let's begin.</i>

814
01:10:28,942 --> 01:10:29,943
We're here.

815
01:10:30,277 --> 01:10:32,780
What a creepy-looking place.

816
01:10:33,743 --> 01:10:34,786
Let's go.

817
01:10:38,869 --> 01:10:41,371
A hideout in an old ruin like this...

818
01:10:41,872 --> 01:10:42,998
It's news to me.

819
01:10:44,208 --> 01:10:45,959
Orochimaru has nothing to do with this.

820
01:10:46,502 --> 01:10:49,004
My clan used this as a weapons store.

821
01:10:49,572 --> 01:10:51,699
We'll prepare for the battle
that will be fought here.

822
01:10:53,915 --> 01:10:56,793
The passageways look so similar,
it's easy to get lost in here.

823
01:10:57,429 --> 01:11:01,391
But what a depressing place.
It stifles my breath.

824
01:11:01,558 --> 01:11:03,727
Sorry if it's depressing here.

825
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:06,099
Huh?

826
01:11:06,855 --> 01:11:09,733
It's been a long time,
Denka and Hina.

827
01:11:10,275 --> 01:11:12,486
It's young Sasuke, after all...

828
01:11:12,911 --> 01:11:14,871
What's your business here?

829
01:11:15,697 --> 01:11:18,867
Weapons and medicine...
and various other things.

830
01:11:19,284 --> 01:11:20,869
We're preparing for battle.

831
01:11:21,261 --> 01:11:22,345
This is...

832
01:11:22,704 --> 01:11:24,957
Oh, a talking raccoon dog?

833
01:11:24,957 --> 01:11:26,542
Hey, come over here.

834
01:11:26,973 --> 01:11:27,829
Yikes...

835
01:11:28,189 --> 01:11:31,234
They're ninja cats.
Don't approach them carelessly.

836
01:11:31,755 --> 01:11:33,173
They'll tear you apart.

837
01:11:33,590 --> 01:11:36,426
You should warn us about stuff
like that from the beginning.

838
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:38,887
Did you bring us a present?

839
01:11:39,304 --> 01:11:41,390
Here...a bottle of catnip.

840
01:11:43,058 --> 01:11:45,060
Thank you.

841
01:11:45,561 --> 01:11:48,146
Follow me. I'll take you to Granny Cat.

842
01:11:52,083 --> 01:11:53,876
I owe you, Granny Cat.

843
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:58,031
It's been so long since we've met,
but you're in such a hurry.

844
01:11:59,157 --> 01:12:01,451
Yeah. I have something important to do.

845
01:12:03,954 --> 01:12:07,374
You're not a ninja cat, right?
There, there.

846
01:12:07,583 --> 01:12:10,460
No, stop. Even this one is too small.

847
01:12:11,282 --> 01:12:12,015
Sorry.

848
01:12:14,256 --> 01:12:17,759
So you're going to see Itachi,
after all?

849
01:12:20,846 --> 01:12:24,600
I've known you both since
you were little,

850
01:12:25,305 --> 01:12:28,012
but little did I imagine
it would come to this...

851
01:12:28,395 --> 01:12:30,981
You two are all that's left
of the Uchiha Clan...

852
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,859
And now, you'll have to
fight to the death.

853
01:12:34,610 --> 01:12:37,571
I'm going. Thanks for everything.

854
01:12:41,533 --> 01:12:45,621
Granny, don't we have something bigger
for him to wear?

855
01:12:46,538 --> 01:12:48,040
In that box over there!

856
01:12:48,242 --> 01:12:50,244
Nothing fits.

857
01:12:50,542 --> 01:12:52,878
Then just wrap that curtain
around him!

858
01:12:53,253 --> 01:12:55,422
I don't run a clothing store!

859
01:12:56,089 --> 01:12:59,509
Granny! What a rude thing to say,
considering he paid us!

860
01:13:03,606 --> 01:13:04,221
Fine.

861
01:13:10,785 --> 01:13:14,080
<i>Cripes, sealing the Tailed Beast
is such a pain!</i>

862
01:13:14,229 --> 01:13:16,565
<i>And there's more to go after this, right?</i>

863
01:13:16,688 --> 01:13:18,356
<i>Just thinking about it frazzles me.</i>

864
01:13:18,608 --> 01:13:21,778
<i>Now then...which way? Hmm...</i>

865
01:13:22,019 --> 01:13:25,522
<i>Umm...Excuse me, Senpai,
"which way" what?</i>

866
01:13:25,547 --> 01:13:27,432
<i>What do you mean?</i>

867
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:28,945
<i>What do you think?!</i>

868
01:13:29,233 --> 01:13:31,902
<i>Do we go for the Nine-Tails' Jinchuriki
whose team is led by Kakashi...</i>

869
01:13:31,927 --> 01:13:34,137
<i>or Sasuke Uchiha...?</i>

870
01:13:36,171 --> 01:13:39,095
<i>Hey, we shouldn't mess with either one!</i>

871
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,456
<i>Our assignment is over!</i>

872
01:13:41,783 --> 01:13:44,925
<i>And furthermore,
Sasuke's not even a Tailed Beast!</i>

873
01:13:45,222 --> 01:13:46,556
<i>Are you kidding...?!</i>

874
01:13:47,349 --> 01:13:50,519
<i>The Nine-Tails' Jinchuriki owes me one
for punching me.</i>

875
01:13:50,810 --> 01:13:53,904
<i>And Kakashi got my right arm...</i>

876
01:13:54,717 --> 01:13:56,385
<i>Then there's Sasuke Uchiha...</i>

877
01:13:56,410 --> 01:14:00,706
<i>I can't forgive him 'cuz he killed
Orochimaru, whom I planned to kill.</i>

878
01:14:01,196 --> 01:14:02,781
<i>Geez...</i>

879
01:14:02,823 --> 01:14:05,993
<i>Once he sets his mind to something,
he just won't listen.</i>

880
01:14:06,702 --> 01:14:08,078
<i>Did you say something?</i>

881
01:14:08,203 --> 01:14:09,413
<i>No.</i>

882
01:14:09,771 --> 01:14:11,815
<i>Humph. We're going, Tobi.</i>

883
01:14:13,709 --> 01:14:18,672
Oh dear...That Deidara has gotten
all worked up

884
01:14:18,672 --> 01:14:21,883
about going after your little brother.

885
01:14:22,384 --> 01:14:24,428
Is that okay with you, Itachi?

886
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:42,821
Let's go!

887
01:14:51,318 --> 01:14:53,320
I see. You've given it
quite a bit of thought.

888
01:14:55,876 --> 01:14:58,712
Okay, I'm issuing the order
for a mission

889
01:14:58,754 --> 01:15:00,839
to locate and detain Itachi Uchiha!

890
01:15:01,506 --> 01:15:04,259
All of you, be extremely careful
and carry out your duties!

891
01:15:04,634 --> 01:15:05,677
- Right!
- Right!

892
01:15:11,099 --> 01:15:13,602
Using this as the central point,

893
01:15:13,643 --> 01:15:15,812
we'll search all four directions
for five kilometers.

894
01:15:16,855 --> 01:15:18,106
If we find nothing,

895
01:15:18,481 --> 01:15:22,485
then we'll move the central point and
spread out five kilometers from there.

896
01:15:22,944 --> 01:15:25,238
And...we'll keep repeating this strategy.

897
01:15:25,572 --> 01:15:30,243
Five kilometers...
Our wireless radio will be out of range!

898
01:15:30,452 --> 01:15:33,872
And if we're separated,
it'll be dangerous!

899
01:15:34,081 --> 01:15:37,334
The rules state that all patrols must
be done by two-man cells.

900
01:15:37,421 --> 01:15:39,214
- If we encounter the enemy--!
- Sakura...

901
01:15:39,419 --> 01:15:40,545
Don't get so worried.

902
01:15:48,646 --> 01:15:52,108
Our voices which travel even farther
than the wireless radios,

903
01:15:52,599 --> 01:15:55,811
and our noses that can instantly
sniff out danger, will protect you.

904
01:15:56,228 --> 01:15:57,229
Pakkun!

905
01:15:57,854 --> 01:16:01,024
All right, let me explain
the patrol team formation.

906
01:16:01,942 --> 01:16:05,320
This time, two ninja hounds will
be assigned to each member.

907
01:16:05,695 --> 01:16:07,948
Two dogs...? Huh? But...

908
01:16:08,824 --> 01:16:11,201
Get along, all of you.

909
01:16:12,452 --> 01:16:14,204
Hello, Sakura.

910
01:16:14,538 --> 01:16:17,374
You're such a snappy female
as usual.

911
01:16:19,584 --> 01:16:21,670
I'm partnering with Shino.

912
01:16:22,003 --> 01:16:24,422
Ugh...You stink of insects.

913
01:16:25,507 --> 01:16:26,508
You stink like a dog.

914
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:28,301
Hello.

915
01:16:28,474 --> 01:16:30,685
Let's work together...

916
01:16:31,096 --> 01:16:33,932
In peace and harmony...
Hehehe!

917
01:16:34,891 --> 01:16:37,644
<i>I wonder if...
I can become friends with dogs?</i>

918
01:16:38,228 --> 01:16:39,604
What about me?

919
01:16:40,188 --> 01:16:42,232
Naruto, you're the Jinchuriki
they're targeting.

920
01:16:42,899 --> 01:16:44,985
Just in case you're attacked,

921
01:16:45,026 --> 01:16:48,029
you'll be with Yamato and
Sensory-Scout Hinata.

922
01:16:48,446 --> 01:16:50,699
And Big Bark Bull.

923
01:16:52,909 --> 01:16:55,328
L-Let's work together, Naruto.

924
01:16:55,787 --> 01:16:56,788
Right!

925
01:16:57,247 --> 01:17:00,709
And being ninja-hound users,
Kiba and I will each have one dog.

926
01:17:01,239 --> 01:17:03,282
So we're all set!

927
01:17:04,212 --> 01:17:05,213
Listen up, everyone.

928
01:17:05,547 --> 01:17:09,050
Above all, you will track
Itachi and Sasuke's scents.

929
01:17:09,263 --> 01:17:11,974
If you find either one of them,

930
01:17:12,095 --> 01:17:15,390
verify their location,
then return to this spot.

931
01:17:16,141 --> 01:17:18,518
Especially you, Naruto.
Don't go running off ahead of us.

932
01:17:19,227 --> 01:17:20,687
I know.

933
01:17:21,521 --> 01:17:23,440
All right then, let's head out.

934
01:17:25,885 --> 01:17:26,886
Scatter!

935
01:17:32,578 --> 01:17:34,247
I'm going.

936
01:17:34,895 --> 01:17:37,981
Itachi Uchiha, eh?
I hope we can find him.

937
01:17:41,458 --> 01:17:42,459
All right!

938
01:17:42,792 --> 01:17:44,544
Sa-su-ke!

939
01:17:44,817 --> 01:17:47,653
I'm staying with you!

940
01:17:47,729 --> 01:17:49,356
You too. Get going.

941
01:17:52,390 --> 01:17:53,391
Drat!

942
01:18:05,690 --> 01:18:07,484
It's completely healed...

943
01:18:07,692 --> 01:18:08,401
Yeah.

944
01:18:08,485 --> 01:18:10,779
And? Which one are we going for?

945
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:12,197
Sasuke or the Nine-Tails...?

946
01:18:12,989 --> 01:18:16,034
Well now, which will it be...?

947
01:18:17,659 --> 01:18:21,329
W-W-Wait, D-Deidara Senpai!

948
01:18:21,514 --> 01:18:23,516
Wait up!

949
01:18:35,074 --> 01:18:36,492
Who are you?!

950
01:18:41,397 --> 01:18:43,482
I guess underlings don't matter.

951
01:18:52,831 --> 01:18:53,957
Go and check.

952
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:55,240
Yes.

953
01:19:00,955 --> 01:19:02,873
Huh? Who are you?!

954
01:19:12,042 --> 01:19:16,088
You're that Akatsuki...
What's his name?

955
01:19:16,419 --> 01:19:20,256
Kaku...Kakuta...Kakusa...Kakushi...

956
01:19:20,399 --> 01:19:21,984
K-Kakuzu...

957
01:19:22,191 --> 01:19:23,859
Yes, that's the one.

958
01:19:23,968 --> 01:19:28,097
You're that Kakuzu's henchman-
his bookkeeper, right?

959
01:19:29,531 --> 01:19:31,575
I'll tell you anything
you want to know.

960
01:19:32,068 --> 01:19:33,820
J-Just please don't kill me...

961
01:19:34,801 --> 01:19:36,970
That's the way...Keep talking.

962
01:19:49,614 --> 01:19:50,782
Let me ask you guys...

963
01:20:00,077 --> 01:20:03,038
Akamaru! Don't lose to
the other ninja hounds!

964
01:20:03,477 --> 01:20:07,147
We'll be the first to detect Sasuke
and Itachi's scents!

965
01:20:10,315 --> 01:20:11,649
You're too slow, Shino!

966
01:20:11,674 --> 01:20:13,301
Don't dawdle!

967
01:20:14,194 --> 01:20:15,653
<i>I don't like them...</i>

968
01:20:17,148 --> 01:20:18,983
Let's go! Pochi! Tama!

969
01:20:19,450 --> 01:20:20,451
Pochi...?

970
01:20:20,740 --> 01:20:21,991
Tama?!

971
01:20:22,697 --> 01:20:25,199
Don't give me silly nicknames!

972
01:20:47,405 --> 01:20:48,572
<i>Sasuke...</i>

973
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:52,881
What's the matter?!

974
01:20:53,949 --> 01:20:56,743
I caught a whiff of
Sasuke Uchiha's scent...

975
01:20:57,345 --> 01:20:58,346
What?!

976
01:21:07,747 --> 01:21:08,498
Well?

977
01:21:08,687 --> 01:21:12,816
The smell is faint,
but it's steadily getting closer.

978
01:21:18,813 --> 01:21:19,856
He's near.

979
01:21:23,179 --> 01:21:26,391
Sakura, do you see Sasuke around?

980
01:21:38,185 --> 01:21:41,229
This isn't good.
The smell is going farther away.

981
01:21:52,584 --> 01:21:54,043
I found it, Tobi!

982
01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:54,919
Yeah!

983
01:21:55,211 --> 01:21:57,130
No kidding?! That was fast!

984
01:21:57,213 --> 01:22:00,216
And? Which one is it?
The Nine-Tails or Sasuke?

985
01:22:01,092 --> 01:22:04,637
What an opportunity.
We're going together, Tobi.

986
01:22:05,013 --> 01:22:06,431
So...Which one?

987
01:22:07,891 --> 01:22:08,933
Just follow me!

988
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:10,101
Yes.

989
01:22:34,125 --> 01:22:37,712
Naruto...Hinata...
You understand, right?

990
01:22:38,213 --> 01:22:38,922
Yes.

991
01:22:39,088 --> 01:22:40,089
Yeah...

992
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:46,763
You're...!

993
01:22:53,895 --> 01:22:56,397
Show yourself...
Who are you?

994
01:23:03,905 --> 01:23:05,907
You found me, after all...

995
01:23:06,324 --> 01:23:07,617
Kabuto Yakushi...

996
01:23:08,117 --> 01:23:11,037
You've got guts approaching us
by yourself.

997
01:23:11,829 --> 01:23:14,624
I wanted to have a chat
with Naruto.

998
01:23:14,791 --> 01:23:17,627
You're not getting away this time.
We're taking you in.

999
01:23:18,211 --> 01:23:22,423
Hey! Kabuto! You would know!
Where is Sasuke?!

1000
01:23:23,925 --> 01:23:26,177
Humph! Still can't get over Sasuke, eh...?

1001
01:23:26,886 --> 01:23:30,265
Is it true that Sasuke
killed Orochimaru?!

1002
01:23:31,432 --> 01:23:33,851
Yeah...It's true.

1003
01:23:36,145 --> 01:23:41,109
More importantly,
I brought you a present today.

1004
01:23:42,068 --> 01:23:43,194
What's that?

1005
01:23:43,987 --> 01:23:48,866
Information our organization
has gathered regarding Akatsuki.

1006
01:23:49,367 --> 01:23:50,577
What of it?

1007
01:23:51,369 --> 01:23:53,580
It's yours. You can have it.

1008
01:23:55,373 --> 01:23:57,166
Now that Orochimaru is dead...

1009
01:23:57,468 --> 01:24:00,095
you're trying to negotiate with us?

1010
01:24:00,670 --> 01:24:05,133
Nope...I don't think it's as easy
as negotiating with something like this...

1011
01:24:05,174 --> 01:24:06,593
Especially with the Leaf Village.

1012
01:24:06,801 --> 01:24:07,927
Then why?

1013
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:12,932
Unlike Orochimaru,
Akatsuki isn't after you.

1014
01:24:13,808 --> 01:24:18,021
It's a simple gift to Naruto.
A token of my gratitude.

1015
01:24:18,438 --> 01:24:20,523
Plus, Akatsuki is pursuing you.

1016
01:24:21,149 --> 01:24:22,150
Gratitude...?

1017
01:24:22,692 --> 01:24:25,862
After Lord Orochimaru died,

1018
01:24:26,487 --> 01:24:29,449
I lost sense of who I was.

1019
01:24:30,074 --> 01:24:32,910
I never knew my parents
or my homeland.

1020
01:24:33,202 --> 01:24:36,289
The enemy found me and
from the time I was little,

1021
01:24:36,314 --> 01:24:39,525
I moved around the lands
and villages as a spy.

1022
01:24:39,876 --> 01:24:43,797
Lands and villages didn't
mean much to me.

1023
01:24:44,214 --> 01:24:46,758
That is, until I began serving
Lord Orochimaru...

1024
01:24:47,508 --> 01:24:50,219
But now, he's gone too.

1025
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:58,545
Just who am I?
The agony of not having an identity...

1026
01:24:58,570 --> 01:25:01,447
You can understand,
can't you, Naruto?

1027
01:25:01,916 --> 01:25:04,071
Like I'd understand
anything you say!

1028
01:25:05,234 --> 01:25:07,403
Humph...I wonder about that.

1029
01:25:08,363 --> 01:25:12,575
Are you Naruto Uzumaki?
Or are you the Nine-Tails?

1030
01:25:12,909 --> 01:25:15,995
In the past, you were shunned...
regarded with loathing.

1031
01:25:16,037 --> 01:25:19,374
You must have questioned yourself
about who you really are.

1032
01:25:21,018 --> 01:25:24,564
However, you had faith
in your strength

1033
01:25:24,794 --> 01:25:27,398
and told yourself that
you were Naruto Uzumaki...

1034
01:25:27,423 --> 01:25:30,802
and you boldly overcame
their views about the Nine-Tails.

1035
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:35,765
What does he intend...
to do with Naruto?

1036
01:25:36,057 --> 01:25:37,725
I can't figure out his intentions...

1037
01:25:38,184 --> 01:25:42,980
And that's why you are sure
of your identity

1038
01:25:43,272 --> 01:25:45,942
and you found friends
who accept you.

1039
01:25:46,484 --> 01:25:50,655
But instead of overcoming
Lord Orochimaru,

1040
01:25:50,697 --> 01:25:53,491
I desperately clung to his power.

1041
01:25:54,033 --> 01:25:57,120
I'm really able to understand
how you feel now.

1042
01:25:57,745 --> 01:26:03,418
You made me realize...
that I want to be like you.

1043
01:26:04,585 --> 01:26:06,087
So now...

1044
01:26:11,884 --> 01:26:15,263
I'm going to surpass Lord Orochimaru
whom I absorbed,

1045
01:26:15,304 --> 01:26:17,682
and discover a new, stronger self.

1046
01:26:24,617 --> 01:26:26,827
I'll find my new self...

1047
01:26:27,442 --> 01:26:29,318
and you have given me
a hint to finding it.

1048
01:26:29,569 --> 01:26:32,405
That's why I'm grateful...Naruto.

1049
01:26:33,994 --> 01:26:36,663
Lord Orochimaru is
the symbol of reincarnation.

1050
01:26:36,909 --> 01:26:40,747
He continues to live on inside me,
as an existence that I must overcome.

1051
01:26:41,497 --> 01:26:42,749
Took...into your body?

1052
01:26:43,044 --> 01:26:43,939
Well...

1053
01:26:44,542 --> 01:26:47,086
It was just a small segment
of Lord Orochimaru's corpse

1054
01:26:47,111 --> 01:26:48,571
after Sasuke killed him...

1055
01:26:48,629 --> 01:26:52,008
which I transplanted into my own body.

1056
01:26:54,135 --> 01:26:57,638
But, his life-force is amazing.

1057
01:26:58,473 --> 01:27:03,269
It's now steadily trying to
take over my body...this thing.

1058
01:27:04,353 --> 01:27:05,646
That's ridiculous...

1059
01:27:06,826 --> 01:27:08,661
<i>What is that?</i>

1060
01:27:09,443 --> 01:27:10,271
<i>Byakugan!</i>

1061
01:27:11,819 --> 01:27:14,572
<i>One-third of his body has
already been taken over.</i>

1062
01:27:16,073 --> 01:27:20,119
But I've been fiercely resisting
this takeover!

1063
01:27:21,162 --> 01:27:25,583
I can feel this part of me that's trying
to overcome Lord Orochimaru!

1064
01:27:30,605 --> 01:27:32,857
Well, give it everything you've got!

1065
01:27:32,882 --> 01:27:34,675
In a jail cell in Leaf Village!

1066
01:27:38,554 --> 01:27:39,555
<i>Wood Style!</i>

1067
01:27:40,598 --> 01:27:42,225
All right! Gotcha!

1068
01:27:42,433 --> 01:27:43,434
Behind you!

1069
01:27:47,647 --> 01:27:48,815
Dammit...

1070
01:27:50,674 --> 01:27:55,637
When I'm able to fully control
Lord Orochimaru's power,

1071
01:27:56,197 --> 01:27:58,533
I will fight you again, Naruto.

1072
01:27:59,857 --> 01:28:01,525
But you come later.

1073
01:28:01,781 --> 01:28:05,368
First, it'll be Sasuke who
brought down Lord Orochimaru.

1074
01:28:05,625 --> 01:28:07,669
What're you gonna do to Sasuke?!

1075
01:28:09,001 --> 01:28:10,086
Until we meet again.

1076
01:28:25,076 --> 01:28:27,954
That outfit...You're...

1077
01:28:28,271 --> 01:28:32,733
So you're Sasuke...
You really do look like Itachi!

1078
01:28:33,804 --> 01:28:34,888
S-Scary!

1079
01:28:41,325 --> 01:28:42,326
<i>Ha!</i>

1080
01:29:03,530 --> 01:29:05,865
Tobi, look how he's glaring at us!

1081
01:29:07,818 --> 01:29:09,778
Where's Itachi Uchiha?

1082
01:29:10,299 --> 01:29:11,300
Huh?

1083
01:29:13,316 --> 01:29:14,942
Tell me, and I'll let you go.

1084
01:29:25,987 --> 01:29:27,530
Sharingan...eh?

1085
01:29:28,409 --> 01:29:30,911
He really is Itachi's little brother.

1086
01:29:31,710 --> 01:29:36,172
You were only able to kill Orochimaru
thanks to your Uchiha blood.

1087
01:29:38,472 --> 01:29:42,351
You're nothing but a fool
blessed with good genes!

1088
01:29:48,951 --> 01:29:49,952
<i>He's fast!</i>

1089
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:51,251
Huh?!

1090
01:29:58,685 --> 01:30:00,144
One down.

1091
01:30:00,539 --> 01:30:03,208
So I'll ask you,
the one with the big mouth, about Itachi.

1092
01:30:04,356 --> 01:30:05,691
What're you doing, Tobi?!

1093
01:30:05,794 --> 01:30:08,171
Don't let your guard down
just because he's a kid!

1094
01:30:08,414 --> 01:30:12,543
His Teleportation jutsu is too quick.
We're no match for him!

1095
01:30:13,296 --> 01:30:14,297
<i>That guy...!</i>

1096
01:30:20,174 --> 01:30:24,261
<i>First, I'll watch his movements
with chakra level C1.</i>

1097
01:30:28,849 --> 01:30:30,643
Tobi! Stay back!

1098
01:30:44,109 --> 01:30:46,153
S-Senpai! Time out!

1099
01:30:46,779 --> 01:30:48,530
Don't do it!

1100
01:30:50,153 --> 01:30:52,030
Senpai! Behind you, behind you!

1101
01:30:57,315 --> 01:30:58,316
Ha!

1102
01:30:59,433 --> 01:31:00,684
Senpai!

1103
01:31:05,208 --> 01:31:08,879
He was strict, but a good partner...

1104
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:12,395
I shall never forget about you,
Deidara Senpai--!

1105
01:31:12,420 --> 01:31:13,588
Will you shut up?!

1106
01:31:15,696 --> 01:31:17,239
Oh, you're alive?

1107
01:31:28,696 --> 01:31:31,699
<i>The ability to produce
an explosive with his palm, huh?</i>

1108
01:31:32,687 --> 01:31:35,147
<i>I somehow managed to escape
by hiding in the bomb blast...</i>

1109
01:31:35,291 --> 01:31:39,170
<i>Good thing I kept
the chakra level at C1.</i>

1110
01:31:41,509 --> 01:31:43,678
<i>He definitely moves swiftly...</i>

1111
01:31:44,177 --> 01:31:45,887
<i>How about this then?</i>

1112
01:32:00,274 --> 01:32:02,777
I'll play with you a bit more!

1113
01:32:11,243 --> 01:32:12,787
Child's play.

1114
01:32:17,374 --> 01:32:18,375
So stupid.

1115
01:32:44,329 --> 01:32:45,580
It's not over yet!

1116
01:33:16,067 --> 01:33:18,445
I guess...it's about time.

1117
01:33:23,707 --> 01:33:24,708
No way!

1118
01:33:24,984 --> 01:33:25,985
Huh?

1119
01:33:29,488 --> 01:33:31,073
Yeah, I thought so.

1120
01:33:31,427 --> 01:33:32,428
Hey...!

1121
01:34:00,124 --> 01:34:01,166
How's that?!

1122
01:34:01,191 --> 01:34:02,401
Oh...

1123
01:34:02,525 --> 01:34:04,903
He's not much, after all...

1124
01:34:14,521 --> 01:34:15,981
I knew it!

1125
01:34:16,285 --> 01:34:17,181
Hey, Tobi!

1126
01:34:17,206 --> 01:34:19,500
Whose side are you on anyway?!

1127
01:34:20,664 --> 01:34:23,042
<i>Well, he's definitely quite skilled...</i>

1128
01:34:24,001 --> 01:34:26,670
<i>Then this calls for C2.</i>

1129
01:34:28,005 --> 01:34:30,007
Th-That's...!

1130
01:34:41,185 --> 01:34:47,066
Ta-daa! One of Senpai's signature
art pieces, the C2 Dragon!

1131
01:34:49,902 --> 01:34:51,570
Tobi, you know what to do, right?!

1132
01:34:51,862 --> 01:34:55,076
Of course, Senpai!
We're going with "that," right?!

1133
01:34:55,101 --> 01:34:58,145
Yeah! "That" is the plan...

1134
01:35:05,292 --> 01:35:08,921
<i>That huge thing becomes
an explosive too?</i>

1135
01:35:10,597 --> 01:35:11,973
I'm counting on you, Tobi!

1136
01:35:12,299 --> 01:35:13,384
Right!

1137
01:35:13,596 --> 01:35:16,932
<i>And judging from its looks,
it'll be attacking from the sky...!</i>

1138
01:35:17,638 --> 01:35:18,973
<i>This is bad.</i>

1139
01:35:19,014 --> 01:35:22,518
Here he comes!
Let's show him, Senpai...

1140
01:35:22,559 --> 01:35:24,603
The power of your pop art!

1141
01:35:24,939 --> 01:35:27,733
Pop art is dead! My art is...

1142
01:35:28,774 --> 01:35:30,901
Superflat!

1143
01:35:39,250 --> 01:35:40,251
Ha!

1144
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:47,364
<i>It's different from before...
A guided missile?</i>

1145
01:35:51,797 --> 01:35:53,048
<i>Where's the other one?</i>

1146
01:35:54,809 --> 01:35:56,519
<i>Guess I'll start off with him!</i>

1147
01:36:05,322 --> 01:36:08,116
<i>Looks like it can only reach up
to five meters, eh?</i>

1148
01:36:08,856 --> 01:36:11,608
<i>Tsk...He figured out my limit.</i>

1149
01:36:11,734 --> 01:36:13,569
That's Kakashi's trick right?!

1150
01:36:13,652 --> 01:36:17,531
I'll give you credit for the skill in
changing chakra form to extend and throw.

1151
01:36:20,617 --> 01:36:23,662
But the force of this one's different
from earlier.

1152
01:36:24,689 --> 01:36:25,815
Blow to bits!

1153
01:36:32,338 --> 01:36:33,797
<i>He really is swift.</i>

1154
01:36:35,507 --> 01:36:36,633
<i>Got him!</i>

1155
01:36:42,264 --> 01:36:43,432
<i>Did I get him...?</i>

1156
01:36:51,565 --> 01:36:54,234
<i>That's...Orochimaru's Curse Mark!</i>

1157
01:36:54,610 --> 01:36:56,653
<i>He can even grow wings?</i>

1158
01:36:57,154 --> 01:36:59,907
<i>He managed to dodge it
by flying upwards...</i>

1159
01:37:03,243 --> 01:37:07,539
Senpai! All the land mine clay is set
and ready to go!

1160
01:37:07,730 --> 01:37:10,608
Good job, Tobi! You stay back.

1161
01:37:10,959 --> 01:37:12,252
Yessir!

1162
01:37:13,420 --> 01:37:17,424
<i>Guided missile attacks from above,
and land mines from the ground!</i>

1163
01:37:17,449 --> 01:37:19,535
The key element of
the C2 coordinated assault

1164
01:37:19,676 --> 01:37:21,970
is using the land mines
to slow you down

1165
01:37:22,125 --> 01:37:24,252
and finishing you off with
a pinpoint missile attack.

1166
01:37:24,527 --> 01:37:28,364
Land mines are planted all around you!

1167
01:37:28,389 --> 01:37:30,933
Step on one and you'll set them off!

1168
01:37:31,457 --> 01:37:34,252
<i>He plans to ram the guided missile
right into me.</i>

1169
01:37:34,817 --> 01:37:39,446
<i>And it's flying just outside
my attack perimeter...</i>

1170
01:37:39,988 --> 01:37:42,032
With that wounded leg,

1171
01:37:42,074 --> 01:37:46,412
I wonder if you can dodge
my aerial attack...hmm?

1172
01:37:48,664 --> 01:37:51,041
The next one's gonna be big!

1173
01:37:53,502 --> 01:37:54,628
As if I'll let you fly away!

1174
01:37:57,923 --> 01:37:58,924
Ha!

1175
01:38:17,693 --> 01:38:20,154
That's what you get for trying to
guard yourself with wings.

1176
01:38:20,195 --> 01:38:23,282
You can't fly anymore, can you?
Not with one wing...

1177
01:38:25,659 --> 01:38:27,494
You're awesome, Deidara Senpai!

1178
01:38:27,786 --> 01:38:29,788
Well, let's settle this!

1179
01:38:42,299 --> 01:38:44,134
As if that'll hit me!

1180
01:38:47,931 --> 01:38:53,395
<i>No foothold! Fall on a land mine
and you'll lose a limb for sure!</i>

1181
01:38:55,781 --> 01:38:57,158
<i>A-A foothold?!</i>

1182
01:39:02,996 --> 01:39:03,872
What?!

1183
01:39:03,937 --> 01:39:04,979
<i>He reached me?</i>

1184
01:39:10,204 --> 01:39:11,288
Deidara's balance...!

1185
01:39:11,663 --> 01:39:14,583
<i>He purposely stuck his sword
in the ground?</i>

1186
01:39:14,833 --> 01:39:17,377
<i>He tested for the presence of land mines
and created a foothold?!</i>

1187
01:39:17,961 --> 01:39:20,464
<i>The length of the sword,
which he used as a foothold...</i>

1188
01:39:20,537 --> 01:39:22,705
<i>And that jump using his single wing...</i>

1189
01:39:24,301 --> 01:39:25,594
<i>This position?!</i>

1190
01:39:26,220 --> 01:39:30,390
<i>I see. With that attack,
he lured me directly above the sword...</i>

1191
01:39:32,559 --> 01:39:34,811
<i>The shortest distance that
a chakra sword would reach...</i>

1192
01:39:39,191 --> 01:39:40,192
Senpai!

1193
01:39:41,068 --> 01:39:42,069
<i>I can't move...!</i>

1194
01:39:44,571 --> 01:39:46,907
<i>This is bad!
Below me are the land mines...!</i>

1195
01:40:00,546 --> 01:40:03,590
Senpai!!

1196
01:40:24,987 --> 01:40:27,698
You did die by bombing, after all!

1197
01:40:27,854 --> 01:40:30,815
Deidara Senpai...you fool!

1198
01:40:33,579 --> 01:40:36,540
I keep telling you to shut up, Tobi!

1199
01:40:36,873 --> 01:40:39,668
Huh? Y-You're still alive...?

1200
01:40:41,008 --> 01:40:42,134
What a stubborn...

1201
01:40:52,222 --> 01:40:53,599
<i>Those eyes...</i>

1202
01:40:56,018 --> 01:40:57,269
<i>It's those same eyes...</i>

1203
01:41:03,846 --> 01:41:05,557
<i>Damn it!</i>

1204
01:41:13,410 --> 01:41:14,620
"Akatsuki"?

1205
01:41:14,762 --> 01:41:19,058
Like I care! Don't interfere with
my appreciation of art.

1206
01:41:19,915 --> 01:41:23,919
And I'm supposed to take
this kid as my partner...?

1207
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:29,468
He's feisty, but looks like
the type to die young.

1208
01:41:30,393 --> 01:41:34,230
It's our leader's orders...
We can use his powers.

1209
01:41:35,307 --> 01:41:39,561
You know about my power?
Just who the hell are...?

1210
01:41:40,176 --> 01:41:43,892
You're the bomb terrorist
who's been supporting

1211
01:41:43,917 --> 01:41:46,749
the anti-government factions
in various lands.

1212
01:41:47,110 --> 01:41:50,656
What purpose would that serve
a rogue ninja like you...?

1213
01:41:50,864 --> 01:41:53,742
Purpose? I have no purpose!

1214
01:41:54,182 --> 01:41:56,810
I get requests to set off explosions,
so I do.

1215
01:41:57,023 --> 01:41:58,650
With my creations!

1216
01:42:00,076 --> 01:42:01,411
Creations?

1217
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:02,521
That's right.

1218
01:42:05,170 --> 01:42:06,171
Look!

1219
01:42:06,838 --> 01:42:09,841
Well? Such refined lines,

1220
01:42:09,841 --> 01:42:12,427
and a form that pursues
two-dimensional deform.

1221
01:42:12,594 --> 01:42:14,096
This is art!

1222
01:42:14,471 --> 01:42:17,557
But that's not all there is to my art!

1223
01:42:18,058 --> 01:42:20,185
My creations flow!

1224
01:42:20,394 --> 01:42:22,896
When it has shape,
it's simply molded clay!

1225
01:42:23,832 --> 01:42:25,386
But this explodes!

1226
01:42:25,644 --> 01:42:28,355
And the explosion causes sublimation,

1227
01:42:28,402 --> 01:42:30,445
and for the first time,
the essence of my creation appears!

1228
01:42:30,445 --> 01:42:34,533
That instant of sublimation is
when I experience true art!

1229
01:42:35,075 --> 01:42:37,828
Art is an explosion!

1230
01:42:44,710 --> 01:42:45,961
How annoying...

1231
01:42:47,248 --> 01:42:48,625
Is he done?

1232
01:42:49,107 --> 01:42:50,233
Who knows...

1233
01:42:52,134 --> 01:42:55,221
Never mind...I'll do it.

1234
01:43:00,133 --> 01:43:01,634
<i>What's with his eyes...?</i>

1235
01:43:02,521 --> 01:43:03,730
You wanna fight?

1236
01:43:04,332 --> 01:43:07,752
If I win,
you will become a member of Akatsuki.

1237
01:43:09,557 --> 01:43:12,268
Don't belittle...me...or my art!

1238
01:43:12,544 --> 01:43:16,172
My ninjutsu is nothing
but noble, refined art!

1239
01:43:20,186 --> 01:43:22,063
Feel my art!

1240
01:43:24,946 --> 01:43:25,733
Ha!

1241
01:43:35,449 --> 01:43:38,077
You talked big...
but is that all you have?

1242
01:43:39,347 --> 01:43:40,766
It's over!

1243
01:43:41,624 --> 01:43:44,669
You should take a good look
at yourself.

1244
01:43:45,103 --> 01:43:45,832
Huh?

1245
01:43:50,364 --> 01:43:51,657
Wh-What?!

1246
01:43:52,235 --> 01:43:54,070
That was close.

1247
01:43:54,095 --> 01:43:56,890
A little later and
you would've blown yourself up.

1248
01:43:56,915 --> 01:44:00,669
I told you he was the type to die young.

1249
01:44:01,828 --> 01:44:04,748
A genjutsu! When?!

1250
01:44:05,251 --> 01:44:07,075
From the very beginning.

1251
01:44:07,100 --> 01:44:09,561
From the moment you looked
into Itachi's Sharingan eye,

1252
01:44:09,586 --> 01:44:12,089
you were under his genjutsu.

1253
01:44:42,775 --> 01:44:43,943
<i>Beautiful...</i>

1254
01:44:49,308 --> 01:44:52,102
<i>This is...art!</i>

1255
01:44:57,835 --> 01:45:02,048
<i>Damn! I became fascinated
by the abilities of another?</i>

1256
01:45:04,139 --> 01:45:08,435
<i>That's art? No way...</i>

1257
01:45:08,562 --> 01:45:10,188
<i>I refuse to acknowledge it!</i>

1258
01:45:13,079 --> 01:45:14,622
You lose.

1259
01:45:15,697 --> 01:45:19,451
<i>Don't mess with me!
I'm better than you!</i>

1260
01:45:21,633 --> 01:45:26,262
<i>My ability is flawless...
It's art that is unbeatable!</i>

1261
01:45:30,441 --> 01:45:34,236
<i>I'm better than you! I can't lose...!</i>

1262
01:45:41,548 --> 01:45:42,841
<i>Lose to such a...</i>

1263
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:47,392
Lose to such a...!

1264
01:45:59,161 --> 01:46:02,874
Huh?! He's eating the Detonation Clay,
which means...

1265
01:46:07,746 --> 01:46:10,457
I saved the best for last!
I'll kill you with this!

1266
01:46:11,001 --> 01:46:12,586
Tobi, get away!

1267
01:46:13,126 --> 01:46:14,961
Whoa, yikes!

1268
01:46:15,192 --> 01:46:16,986
It's the C4 Karura!

1269
01:46:29,866 --> 01:46:31,659
Hurry!!

1270
01:46:39,232 --> 01:46:43,069
<i>This was supposed to be
my trump card to kill Itachi, but...</i>

1271
01:46:47,911 --> 01:46:49,037
<i>What?!</i>

1272
01:46:51,737 --> 01:46:54,657
<i>Is this a bomb too? If so...</i>

1273
01:46:55,406 --> 01:46:58,826
<i>It's huge! If this goes off...</i>

1274
01:47:05,306 --> 01:47:07,808
What, you're just gonna run away?!

1275
01:47:12,826 --> 01:47:16,663
You really think you can escape
from my C4 Karura?!

1276
01:47:43,644 --> 01:47:44,645
<i>It misfired...?</i>

1277
01:47:52,308 --> 01:47:54,853
<i>No...That's not it.</i>

1278
01:47:56,396 --> 01:47:57,397
<i>What?!</i>

1279
01:47:57,605 --> 01:47:59,149
I win!

1280
01:48:03,928 --> 01:48:06,096
Art is an explosion!

1281
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,043
Sublimate!

1282
01:48:19,252 --> 01:48:20,295
Damn!

1283
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:23,153
This can't...be happening!

1284
01:48:28,925 --> 01:48:30,802
Now this is my greatest masterpiece!

1285
01:48:31,973 --> 01:48:32,974
There we go!

1286
01:48:35,727 --> 01:48:39,147
The C4 Karura...
Super tiny, nano-sized explosives.

1287
01:48:40,690 --> 01:48:42,817
Using the blast created from
rupturing the giant Deidara,

1288
01:48:42,859 --> 01:48:45,487
explosives too small
for the human eye to see

1289
01:48:45,528 --> 01:48:47,697
are dispersed into the atmosphere.

1290
01:48:48,597 --> 01:48:50,683
Any living being that inhales them

1291
01:48:50,825 --> 01:48:54,245
will set off explosions internally
in all parts of the body.

1292
01:48:54,829 --> 01:49:00,835
And these little explosions will
destroy the body on the cellular level...

1293
01:49:05,256 --> 01:49:06,841
A frightening jutsu...

1294
01:49:08,384 --> 01:49:10,637
I have to thank Itachi...

1295
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:19,437
I've won! I've won!

1296
01:49:19,462 --> 01:49:20,915
My art wo-!

1297
01:49:37,615 --> 01:49:39,825
It seems you've exhausted your chakra...

1298
01:49:40,875 --> 01:49:42,502
Your reaction was slow.

1299
01:49:43,064 --> 01:49:44,107
Those eyes...

1300
01:49:45,130 --> 01:49:47,257
Explosives too small for
the eye to see...

1301
01:49:47,356 --> 01:49:51,069
But my Sharingan can distinguish
a chakra by its color.

1302
01:49:52,334 --> 01:49:55,170
The mini-bombs molded with
your chakra...

1303
01:49:55,564 --> 01:49:59,610
They were as clear to me as
a cloud of smoke.

1304
01:50:00,536 --> 01:50:02,747
I could also tell that you were hovering

1305
01:50:02,772 --> 01:50:06,442
just outside the mini-bombs'
blast range.

1306
01:50:07,191 --> 01:50:10,778
So as long as I could see the explosives,
escape was easy.

1307
01:50:13,158 --> 01:50:16,327
But I saw you die from my C4...

1308
01:50:20,331 --> 01:50:22,167
That was my genjutsu.

1309
01:50:25,587 --> 01:50:28,923
So that was it, after all...

1310
01:50:31,176 --> 01:50:32,886
I avoided your vital spot.

1311
01:50:33,803 --> 01:50:35,722
Now tell me where Itachi is.

1312
01:50:37,515 --> 01:50:41,394
That's why I said...
"I have to thank Itachi."

1313
01:50:45,690 --> 01:50:48,067
A clay...clone?!

1314
01:50:48,818 --> 01:50:52,906
I anticipated your genjutsu.
You're just like Itachi!

1315
01:50:53,198 --> 01:50:56,284
I never fall for the same trick twice!

1316
01:50:57,026 --> 01:51:00,529
<i>Yes...Ever since
the day I fought Itachi...</i>

1317
01:51:01,497 --> 01:51:05,627
<i>I trained my left eye to
counter the Sharingan.</i>

1318
01:51:06,794 --> 01:51:10,381
<i>As if I'd neglect training
to counter genjutsu!</i>

1319
01:51:12,425 --> 01:51:16,429
This time, it's over for real!
Eat my C4!

1320
01:51:42,846 --> 01:51:45,307
It seems you're the one lacking chakra!

1321
01:51:45,416 --> 01:51:47,919
You don't even have
the strength left to dodge! Huh?!

1322
01:51:59,597 --> 01:52:00,640
Just as I thought...

1323
01:52:00,974 --> 01:52:05,979
Inside are the same invisible
C4 explosives.

1324
01:52:12,939 --> 01:52:15,024
Tsk! My wound hurts...

1325
01:52:15,368 --> 01:52:18,341
On top of that, I used up my chakra
with that last attack.

1326
01:52:18,366 --> 01:52:20,326
What a poor piece of work...!

1327
01:52:42,765 --> 01:52:44,600
Now what'll you do?! Hmm?

1328
01:52:56,237 --> 01:52:57,989
<i>He used what's left of
his Lightning Blade...</i>

1329
01:53:00,450 --> 01:53:04,245
Your Lightning Blades won't reach me
at this distance!

1330
01:53:08,032 --> 01:53:09,033
It's over.

1331
01:53:10,209 --> 01:53:10,971
Ha!

1332
01:53:34,067 --> 01:53:36,611
I won. I'm the winner!

1333
01:53:38,446 --> 01:53:40,656
My art triumphed!

1334
01:53:52,919 --> 01:53:53,920
Why?!

1335
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:14,763
You...

1336
01:54:15,441 --> 01:54:18,486
Don't tell me you figured it out?

1337
01:54:21,197 --> 01:54:23,282
Yeah...Quite a while back...

1338
01:54:24,075 --> 01:54:29,372
When facing the Sharingan,
it's basic to hide and form your seal.

1339
01:54:29,872 --> 01:54:32,750
No matter how fast you are,
these eyes will read them.

1340
01:54:33,828 --> 01:54:37,248
Every jutsu you've used has been
with Earth Style seals.

1341
01:54:38,256 --> 01:54:42,135
My Chidori is the Lighting Style...
Get it now?

1342
01:54:42,866 --> 01:54:45,035
So you knew, after all...

1343
01:54:46,180 --> 01:54:49,642
Then that Lightning Blade
you used was to...

1344
01:54:50,101 --> 01:54:52,395
The Earth Style is vulnerable
to the Lightning Style.

1345
01:54:52,645 --> 01:54:56,774
Your explosives won't detonate against
my Lightning Style.

1346
01:54:57,653 --> 01:54:59,322
Isn't that your weakness?

1347
01:55:00,643 --> 01:55:01,644
You...!

1348
01:55:02,947 --> 01:55:06,951
I see...The Lightning Blade earlier
was to run it through yourself...

1349
01:55:07,658 --> 01:55:10,619
and you de-triggered the C4
that had entered your body.

1350
01:55:13,709 --> 01:55:17,046
Yeah...Thanks to that,
my body's in tatters.

1351
01:55:18,079 --> 01:55:20,874
Although the correct name for
my jutsu is Chidori...

1352
01:55:22,675 --> 01:55:25,539
<i>He figured out the weakness of
my art in such a short time,</i>

1353
01:55:25,564 --> 01:55:26,857
<i>and so accurately...</i>

1354
01:55:28,008 --> 01:55:29,051
When did you realize it?

1355
01:55:29,849 --> 01:55:31,851
After that blow from the land mine.

1356
01:55:32,685 --> 01:55:36,397
Although, I've been analyzing it
from the very beginning...

1357
01:55:37,466 --> 01:55:41,511
Since I countered your first attack
with Chidori senbon.

1358
01:55:42,057 --> 01:55:46,603
Among the bombs you created,
some exploded and some didn't.

1359
01:55:48,012 --> 01:55:50,056
That's when I formulated a hypothesis.

1360
01:55:51,588 --> 01:55:52,714
Hypothesis...?

1361
01:55:54,058 --> 01:55:58,896
That time, the only one that exploded
was the one you threw

1362
01:55:59,069 --> 01:56:01,863
when you tried to evade my attack.

1363
01:56:02,557 --> 01:56:07,980
All the explosives that I countered with
my Chidori senbon didn't detonate.

1364
01:56:09,053 --> 01:56:13,307
However, it was possible that
you purposely didn't trigger them...

1365
01:56:14,603 --> 01:56:17,564
because they fell close
to your comrade.

1366
01:56:19,462 --> 01:56:22,715
In other words, you weren't sure
if they didn't detonate

1367
01:56:22,814 --> 01:56:25,400
because of your Chidori or
because I didn't make them explode.

1368
01:56:27,838 --> 01:56:32,468
I see...So that's why you tested those
two alternatives on the land mine?

1369
01:56:33,412 --> 01:56:34,580
Exactly.

1370
01:56:34,605 --> 01:56:36,858
<i>Step on one and you'll set them off!</i>

1371
01:56:37,765 --> 01:56:41,101
If they were self-triggered,
your will was not involved.

1372
01:56:41,348 --> 01:56:43,616
So I could test if my Lightning Style jutsu

1373
01:56:43,641 --> 01:56:47,437
could disarm your Earth Style bombs.

1374
01:56:50,692 --> 01:56:54,113
That's right. That time I stuck my sword
into the ground...

1375
01:56:55,035 --> 01:56:57,538
I wasn't verifying the location
of land mines.

1376
01:56:58,145 --> 01:57:00,606
I shot through them with my sword
tinged with Chidori

1377
01:57:00,631 --> 01:57:03,592
in order to confirm my theory.

1378
01:57:04,663 --> 01:57:09,418
But...how?! How could you pinpoint
the position of the landmines?!

1379
01:57:10,502 --> 01:57:12,921
This eye distinguishes chakra by its color.

1380
01:57:15,598 --> 01:57:17,266
Didn't I tell you that earlier?

1381
01:57:17,832 --> 01:57:20,042
You could see the position of
the land mines...?!

1382
01:57:22,161 --> 01:57:27,232
<i>He wasn't poking into the ground to test
where they were and where he could step?</i>

1383
01:57:28,806 --> 01:57:32,560
<i>He was checking whether
he could disarm the Detonation Clay...</i>

1384
01:57:33,465 --> 01:57:38,762
But what would you have done
if the land mines exploded?!

1385
01:57:39,389 --> 01:57:44,102
It was one or the other.
But I had another back-up plan.

1386
01:57:45,052 --> 01:57:47,180
Although I didn't have a chance
to demonstrate it...

1387
01:57:47,851 --> 01:57:51,104
<i>This guy...
He even had another jutsu...</i>

1388
01:58:03,002 --> 01:58:04,587
Where is Itachi?

1389
01:58:31,326 --> 01:58:34,788
You may try to look good,
but you're barely managing too.

1390
01:58:34,911 --> 01:58:37,747
It seems your chakra got drastically low.

1391
01:58:39,185 --> 01:58:43,565
I win. I still have
Detonation Clay to...Huh?!

1392
01:58:48,873 --> 01:58:54,671
Under these conditions,
shouldn't you be panicking a little?

1393
01:58:55,721 --> 01:58:59,016
This time, my art will kill you for sure!

1394
01:59:15,190 --> 01:59:19,736
That's what pisses me off about you!
Both of you brothers!

1395
01:59:20,093 --> 01:59:21,970
Don't pretend to be so cool!

1396
01:59:24,382 --> 01:59:28,011
Those eyes!
That overconfident eye irritates me!

1397
01:59:28,705 --> 01:59:32,834
As if it denies my art! It's unforgivable!

1398
01:59:33,343 --> 01:59:37,347
Those eyes which show absolutely
no respect for my art...

1399
01:59:37,609 --> 01:59:41,613
Those eyes that ignore my art...
are unforgivable!

1400
01:59:47,138 --> 01:59:49,182
I couldn't care less about such a thing.

1401
01:59:49,847 --> 01:59:52,266
Never mind that. Tell me where Itachi is.

1402
02:00:04,208 --> 02:00:06,001
So you've drawn back your Sharingan...

1403
02:00:06,435 --> 02:00:08,604
You really take me lightly!

1404
02:00:44,424 --> 02:00:47,177
This is my ultimate art...!

1405
02:00:47,970 --> 02:00:50,098
Now I will detonate myself.

1406
02:00:50,735 --> 02:00:51,820
<i>He's...!</i>

1407
02:00:52,934 --> 02:00:55,312
With death, I will become art.

1408
02:00:55,716 --> 02:00:58,429
This never-before-seen explosion
will leave

1409
02:00:58,454 --> 02:01:01,290
a never-before-seen scar on this land.

1410
02:01:01,463 --> 02:01:06,635
And...! My art will win
never-before-seen admiration!

1411
02:01:07,939 --> 02:01:10,108
<i>Sorry, Tobi...</i>

1412
02:01:12,835 --> 02:01:16,755
In the midst of my admiration,
you will definitely die!

1413
02:01:19,099 --> 02:01:21,518
An explosion that will cover
a ten-kilometer radius...

1414
02:01:21,606 --> 02:01:24,192
You won't be able to get away!

1415
02:01:25,160 --> 02:01:26,829
Now, tremble with fear!

1416
02:01:27,378 --> 02:01:30,047
Be in awe! Despair!

1417
02:01:31,915 --> 02:01:33,542
Scream!

1418
02:01:34,004 --> 02:01:36,048
My art is...

1419
02:01:48,227 --> 02:01:50,020
An explosion!!

1420
02:02:14,503 --> 02:02:15,588
Wha--?!

1421
02:02:19,633 --> 02:02:20,968
What is that?!

1422
02:02:33,689 --> 02:02:34,857
What the--?!

1423
02:02:39,653 --> 02:02:40,946
Kakashi, what is that?

1424
02:02:41,614 --> 02:02:44,950
This chakra...
It's that Akatsuki member...

1425
02:02:50,789 --> 02:02:52,374
Wh-What could it be?

1426
02:02:53,584 --> 02:02:54,919
Let's go check it out!

1427
02:02:55,461 --> 02:02:56,462
Right!

1428
02:03:01,508 --> 02:03:02,509
Look!

1429
02:03:05,888 --> 02:03:08,015
<i>Sasuke...It can't be...!</i>

1430
02:03:14,877 --> 02:03:17,546
<i>I can't sense Sasuke's chakra!</i>

1431
02:03:18,088 --> 02:03:20,757
That's near our rendezvous point...

1432
02:03:21,028 --> 02:03:22,154
Don't tell me he's...!

1433
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,377
Damn! It's just as I feared!

1434
02:03:29,954 --> 02:03:33,749
<i>That Deidara...
He blew himself up.</i>

1435
02:03:34,420 --> 02:03:35,963
Where's Tobi?

1436
02:03:39,088 --> 02:03:43,759
<i>Probably dead...
He was within the blast range...</i>

1437
02:03:50,557 --> 02:03:52,893
<i>Deidara is dead.</i>

1438
02:03:52,935 --> 02:03:56,021
<i>In the end, he went out with a bang.</i>

1439
02:03:56,188 --> 02:04:00,317
Oh dear.
Another member has been lost...

1440
02:04:00,442 --> 02:04:03,696
And I thought he was
pretty strong.

1441
02:04:04,613 --> 02:04:07,491
So? Which one did him in?

1442
02:04:07,878 --> 02:04:11,464
Sasuke? Or the Nine-Tails' Jinchuriki?

1443
02:04:11,620 --> 02:04:13,414
<i>It was Sasuke.</i>

1444
02:04:13,664 --> 02:04:15,124
<i>However...</i>

1445
02:04:16,834 --> 02:04:19,086
<i>It looks like Sasuke is dead too.</i>

1446
02:04:22,089 --> 02:04:24,216
Deidara took Sasuke down
with him, huh...?

1447
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:27,094
<i>You should feel grateful, Itachi.</i>

1448
02:04:27,372 --> 02:04:30,208
<i>Deidara did you a favor
and got rid of your problem.</i>

1449
02:04:30,848 --> 02:04:35,185
Hmm...I feel like
we've forgotten something...

1450
02:04:35,394 --> 02:04:37,604
<i>Looks like Tobi is dead too.</i>

1451
02:04:37,771 --> 02:04:40,983
<i>That Deidara detonated himself
without regard for his surroundings.</i>

1452
02:04:41,194 --> 02:04:43,613
Ah yes, Tobi.

1453
02:04:43,861 --> 02:04:50,659
It must've been quite a jutsu
if that chicken was unable to escape.

1454
02:04:51,232 --> 02:04:56,237
<i>No matter...
He can easily be replaced.</i>

1455
02:04:56,790 --> 02:04:58,792
<i>The loss of Deidara, however,
is unfortunate.</i>

1456
02:04:59,209 --> 02:05:01,879
I liked Tobi.

1457
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:05,674
When it came to lightening the mood
in our rather gloomy organization,

1458
02:05:05,699 --> 02:05:08,618
Tobi was quite talented.

1459
02:05:08,927 --> 02:05:10,179
<i>I'm going.</i>

1460
02:05:10,596 --> 02:05:13,557
<i>I shall mourn Deidara's death in silence.</i>

1461
02:05:17,097 --> 02:05:19,683
<i>Then I'll mourn for Tobi.</i>

1462
02:05:19,708 --> 02:05:21,626
<i>You must really be bored, huh?</i>

1463
02:05:27,863 --> 02:05:30,657
When the crest of
the snake vanishes...

1464
02:05:31,292 --> 02:05:34,546
Then...I do this...

1465
02:05:37,422 --> 02:05:40,049
Add a drop of Sasuke's blood...

1466
02:05:40,959 --> 02:05:42,044
All right.

1467
02:05:43,188 --> 02:05:44,481
<i>Summoning jutsu!</i>

1468
02:05:52,959 --> 02:05:56,129
S-So, this is Orochimaru's
Summoning jutsu...

1469
02:05:56,350 --> 02:05:57,726
Manda...

1470
02:05:58,084 --> 02:06:00,268
Even Orochimaru had trouble
controlling this guy.

1471
02:06:00,293 --> 02:06:01,627
How did Sasuke manage to...?

1472
02:06:06,201 --> 02:06:08,328
<i>I see. He used genjutsu...</i>

1473
02:06:12,923 --> 02:06:15,217
Whoa, you're a mess!

1474
02:06:16,662 --> 02:06:18,247
Who did you fight?

1475
02:06:19,063 --> 02:06:23,109
<i>You...had the nerve...</i>

1476
02:06:24,086 --> 02:06:26,547
<i>to use me...</i>

1477
02:06:26,672 --> 02:06:29,800
<i>You damned brat...</i>

1478
02:06:29,898 --> 02:06:35,403
<i>Those eyes...you controlled me...
with those eyes...</i>

1479
02:06:35,915 --> 02:06:39,960
<i>I...of all...people...</i>

1480
02:06:44,633 --> 02:06:47,219
Oh-ohh, he's dead.

1481
02:06:47,792 --> 02:06:51,128
Wasn't Manda Orochimaru's
favorite pet?

1482
02:06:51,572 --> 02:06:54,158
You ought to treat animals better...

1483
02:06:54,384 --> 02:06:57,179
And the whole manipulation
with the genjutsu...

1484
02:06:59,121 --> 02:07:03,667
There wasn't time to think.
I had no choice...

1485
02:07:04,585 --> 02:07:05,669
Found you!

1486
02:07:06,628 --> 02:07:07,963
I figured you'd be here!

1487
02:07:08,370 --> 02:07:11,581
Your chakra suddenly disappeared,
so I wondered what had happened...

1488
02:07:11,745 --> 02:07:13,205
Did you transport yourself?!

1489
02:07:13,927 --> 02:07:15,888
You hid yourself inside Manda,

1490
02:07:15,888 --> 02:07:20,392
then used the Transportation Technique
to escape into another dimension...

1491
02:07:20,767 --> 02:07:22,519
So why are you in such bad shape?

1492
02:07:23,604 --> 02:07:27,566
Just before escaping,
we both got hit by the blast wave.

1493
02:07:28,054 --> 02:07:29,514
My opponent was one of the Akatsuki.

1494
02:07:30,110 --> 02:07:32,070
He was stronger than I expected...

1495
02:07:32,571 --> 02:07:36,867
In any case, he needs time to rest.
Right, Karin?

1496
02:07:37,993 --> 02:07:40,495
Ahem! How pathetic!

1497
02:07:40,550 --> 02:07:43,053
And you call yourself the man
who killed Orochimaru?!

1498
02:07:43,919 --> 02:07:46,421
Orochimaru was already weakened
to begin with.

1499
02:07:47,133 --> 02:07:48,634
That's all there is to it.

1500
02:07:58,306 --> 02:08:00,474
It just won't stop.

1501
02:08:00,624 --> 02:08:05,045
It's strange to have this much rain
around here at this time of year.

1502
02:08:20,702 --> 02:08:23,038
You'll ruin your health.

1503
02:08:27,251 --> 02:08:33,590
I don't know what someone as cold as you
could be thinking about right now...

1504
02:08:33,709 --> 02:08:36,670
But from here,
you look as though you are crying.

1505
02:08:37,977 --> 02:08:41,314
It's too bad about your younger brother...

1506
02:08:41,640 --> 02:08:45,978
You are now the sole survivor
of the Uchiha clan.

1507
02:08:46,687 --> 02:08:47,688
No.

1508
02:08:47,813 --> 02:08:48,814
Hmm?

1509
02:08:55,195 --> 02:08:57,990
He's not dead. Also...

1510
02:08:59,199 --> 02:09:01,201
What do you mean?

1511
02:09:11,817 --> 02:09:12,985
Naruto!

1512
02:09:13,380 --> 02:09:15,924
Looks like it caught all our attention.

1513
02:09:16,425 --> 02:09:17,718
What happened?!

1514
02:09:18,218 --> 02:09:21,346
There are signs that Sasuke
was just here.

1515
02:09:22,597 --> 02:09:25,392
It's very faint,
but his scent still lingers.

1516
02:09:25,517 --> 02:09:28,854
I also detect other scents.

1517
02:09:29,479 --> 02:09:30,981
What does it mean?

1518
02:09:31,273 --> 02:09:36,028
From the damage to the terrain,
I'd say there was a battle here.

1519
02:09:36,820 --> 02:09:40,782
I knew it! One of the other scents
belongs to that fellow in town

1520
02:09:40,807 --> 02:09:42,767
on whom I detected Sasuke's scent.

1521
02:09:43,076 --> 02:09:44,077
Huh?

1522
02:09:44,453 --> 02:09:49,916
Looks like there are others
traveling alongside Sasuke.

1523
02:09:50,292 --> 02:09:51,877
He has a companion.

1524
02:09:54,421 --> 02:09:56,131
Then, back there...

1525
02:09:58,467 --> 02:10:00,886
It's probable that...

1526
02:10:01,279 --> 02:10:03,531
Sasuke has formed his unit.

1527
02:10:04,139 --> 02:10:09,686
One of the five other scents belongs
to Deidara from Akatsuki.

1528
02:10:11,063 --> 02:10:12,814
Wasn't he the one
who self-destructed

1529
02:10:12,814 --> 02:10:15,525
and was transported to another dimension
by your jutsu, Sensei?!

1530
02:10:16,318 --> 02:10:20,614
It seems he faked
his own death to escape...

1531
02:10:21,490 --> 02:10:26,620
The Akatsuki operate in two-man cells,
so there are three left.

1532
02:10:27,287 --> 02:10:29,623
Sasuke is moving with
a four-man cell.

1533
02:10:29,831 --> 02:10:32,000
Who cares how many there are.

1534
02:10:32,350 --> 02:10:34,561
Let's get moving and
trace Sasuke's scent!

1535
02:10:36,088 --> 02:10:37,547
We can't.

1536
02:10:37,943 --> 02:10:39,570
Huh? Why not?

1537
02:10:40,342 --> 02:10:42,427
The scent stops here.

1538
02:10:43,303 --> 02:10:44,554
What does that mean?!

1539
02:10:47,391 --> 02:10:48,809
Usually in a situation like this,

1540
02:10:48,850 --> 02:10:51,895
either Sasuke was blasted to bits
by the explosion...

1541
02:10:52,083 --> 02:10:56,144
or Sasuke used
the Transportation Technique to escape.

1542
02:10:56,817 --> 02:10:58,693
Transportation Technique...?

1543
02:11:05,575 --> 02:11:07,494
It's probably the latter.

1544
02:11:08,745 --> 02:11:11,581
My sense of smell is keener
than a dog's right now.

1545
02:11:11,665 --> 02:11:13,125
I've found Sasuke!

1546
02:11:13,917 --> 02:11:16,128
<i>A nose that's sharper than
the ninja hounds...?</i>

1547
02:11:16,169 --> 02:11:17,671
<i>Impressive, Kiba.</i>

1548
02:11:17,712 --> 02:11:20,006
<i>Just what I would expect
from a member of the Inuzuka clan.</i>

1549
02:11:21,091 --> 02:11:22,884
Kiba, lead the way!

1550
02:11:23,135 --> 02:11:26,054
Hah! You talked about killing Itachi...

1551
02:11:26,096 --> 02:11:28,682
You won't be able to move around
for some time in that condition!

1552
02:11:29,141 --> 02:11:33,687
We've been moving nonstop lately.
It's a good chance to rest up.

1553
02:11:33,937 --> 02:11:37,357
All you've done is rest,
you feeble punk!

1554
02:11:37,381 --> 02:11:38,507
There, finished.

1555
02:11:38,610 --> 02:11:40,779
You didn't do a thing at
the northern hideout,

1556
02:11:40,804 --> 02:11:42,306
so don't start telling me
what to do now.

1557
02:11:42,571 --> 02:11:45,740
What?! Wanna make something of it?!

1558
02:11:45,782 --> 02:11:47,659
Then let's do it!

1559
02:11:47,684 --> 02:11:49,102
Enough already!

1560
02:11:49,712 --> 02:11:54,759
Suigetsu, Karin...
Have you gathered data on Itachi?

1561
02:11:55,292 --> 02:11:58,003
You're in no shape to act so bossy!

1562
02:11:58,553 --> 02:12:01,639
I've picked up some tips
about Akatsuki,

1563
02:12:01,715 --> 02:12:04,384
but nothing specific
about Itachi himself.

1564
02:12:05,218 --> 02:12:06,553
I got zero.

1565
02:12:06,678 --> 02:12:09,306
Seems they're targeting
specific people though...

1566
02:12:10,015 --> 02:12:13,059
People with special chakra.

1567
02:12:14,144 --> 02:12:15,687
Special chakra...?

1568
02:12:16,311 --> 02:12:20,857
I did some talking to animals and
located a number of Akatsuki hideouts.

1569
02:12:20,923 --> 02:12:22,299
It seems they always sense

1570
02:12:22,324 --> 02:12:25,077
a powerful, unpleasant chakra
around each area.

1571
02:12:26,156 --> 02:12:27,866
That's what the animals have told me.

1572
02:12:28,533 --> 02:12:33,997
Wow, even simpleminded animals
can sense chakra, eh...?

1573
02:12:34,484 --> 02:12:37,070
Or maybe it's because
they're simpleminded...

1574
02:12:37,095 --> 02:12:38,846
Just like you Karin!

1575
02:12:40,736 --> 02:12:42,446
What did you say, you jerk?!

1576
02:12:51,169 --> 02:12:54,797
Suigetsu! This time,
you're not getting away with it!

1577
02:12:54,822 --> 02:12:57,325
Hey...W-Wait...hey!

1578
02:12:59,767 --> 02:13:02,145
Kill...I want to kill...

1579
02:13:02,818 --> 02:13:03,861
- Huh?
- Huh?!

1580
02:13:08,104 --> 02:13:11,124
Shoot! Jugo's killing impulse is loose!

1581
02:13:11,202 --> 02:13:12,786
Sasuke! Hurry it--!

1582
02:13:12,973 --> 02:13:14,600
Calm down, Jugo.

1583
02:13:25,496 --> 02:13:27,457
S-Sorry...

1584
02:13:54,879 --> 02:13:56,839
I'm sure of it. It's this way!

1585
02:14:03,545 --> 02:14:05,714
From his scent,
I can tell he's stopped moving.

1586
02:14:05,994 --> 02:14:08,163
It seems he's resting.

1587
02:14:08,188 --> 02:14:09,564
<i>It's our chance.</i>

1588
02:14:12,329 --> 02:14:17,000
<i>Sasuke...
Our paths have finally crossed.</i>

1589
02:14:28,757 --> 02:14:30,467
Come, Pain...

1590
02:14:31,323 --> 02:14:32,658
He's here.

1591
02:14:47,130 --> 02:14:49,341
And...what of Sasuke?

1592
02:14:49,633 --> 02:14:51,176
He's coming along nicely...

1593
02:14:51,854 --> 02:14:55,233
He was using the Sharingan's power
to his fullest...

1594
02:14:55,513 --> 02:14:57,932
His eyes will surpass Itachi's...

1595
02:14:58,808 --> 02:15:03,063
The time has come.
He must be ready as well.

1596
02:15:03,438 --> 02:15:05,398
After all, he doesn't have much time.

1597
02:15:06,441 --> 02:15:08,610
Then what about the Nine-Tails?

1598
02:15:09,152 --> 02:15:13,657
You hunt it.
As leader, failure is not an option.

1599
02:15:15,116 --> 02:15:19,621
Naruto Uzumaki...
He's no longer just a kid.

1600
02:15:20,413 --> 02:15:23,776
He has now mastered a formidable
jutsu...and has many comrades.

1601
02:15:23,833 --> 02:15:25,669
It won't be easy.

1602
02:15:26,169 --> 02:15:29,089
He even destroyed two of
Kakuzu's lives with a single blow.

1603
02:15:30,090 --> 02:15:35,137
To speak of the target as
a threat has no meaning before Pain.

1604
02:15:35,679 --> 02:15:38,348
He has never lost a battle.

1605
02:15:41,643 --> 02:15:43,853
Well, that's true.

1606
02:15:53,321 --> 02:15:54,989
We're done talking.

1607
02:15:56,282 --> 02:15:59,786
Tell the other members to hurry
with the remaining Jinchuriki.

1608
02:16:00,286 --> 02:16:01,663
I know.

1609
02:16:02,394 --> 02:16:03,771
At last...

1610
02:16:04,082 --> 02:16:07,794
We are so close to the moment
of achieving our goal...

1611
02:16:16,011 --> 02:16:20,641
Then everything shall be restored
to its rightful place...

1612
02:16:42,735 --> 02:16:45,529
The true power of the Sharingan...

1613
02:16:45,832 --> 02:16:48,376
The true power of I,
Madara Uchiha!

1614
02:17:01,639 --> 02:17:03,892
The sky is crying again...

1615
02:17:05,810 --> 02:17:08,188
Pain...Are you...?
