1
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:14,639
Aren't you being a little too laid back?

2
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:18,368
Oh, well you know, things were
pretty tense around here recently

3
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,687
with the incident in the Sand Village.

4
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,689
But now that it's been settled...

5
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:25,483
I'm suddenly overcome
with exhaustion...

6
00:00:25,705 --> 00:00:28,445
Even so, we don't know
what's going to happen next.

7
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:31,364
Only by being cautious at all times
are we able to prevent...

8
00:00:31,389 --> 00:00:34,183
You won't last if
you remain cautious at all times.

9
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,870
Come on, relax, relax!

10
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,162
Move, move, move!

11
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:53,261
Last spurt! Goal!

12
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:57,685
First place!

13
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,817
Sadly, second place!

14
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,375
- What kind of race is that?
- Beats me...

15
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,492
Hey Lee, you need to train more.

16
00:01:15,671 --> 00:01:18,966
Yes! I will try to be
first place next time.

17
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:23,041
But, there is regrettable news.

18
00:01:23,734 --> 00:01:25,903
Wh-What is it?

19
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:29,735
Lee, you are not second place.

20
00:01:30,987 --> 00:01:33,718
You are...third place!

21
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:34,969
Huh?!

22
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,050
Second place is Kakashi,
whom I am carrying!

23
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:46,481
Kakashi, you are too lucky!
You don't need to thank me.

24
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,445
I feel like I learned another
important lesson from you.

25
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,782
As usual, I can't keep up
with their craziness.

26
00:01:56,472 --> 00:01:58,785
Although we did run along after them.

27
00:01:59,463 --> 00:02:00,464
Ridiculous!

28
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,332
Okay, everyone's here, eh?!

29
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,085
Then let's go report to
Lady Tsunade right away.

30
00:02:07,358 --> 00:02:09,235
Um, Guy Sensei...

31
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:10,839
What is it?

32
00:02:11,313 --> 00:02:12,940
Kakashi Sensei is...

33
00:02:13,363 --> 00:02:14,948
Huh? Oh!

34
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:18,596
Guess it's the hospital before reporting.

35
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:04,909
It looks like Deidara was done in too...

36
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:08,906
There's no question that his cause
of death is from an explosion...

37
00:04:09,211 --> 00:04:10,379
Don't you agree, Zetsu?

38
00:04:11,082 --> 00:04:12,917
He's probably laying there dead
somewhere around there...

39
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,063
Get your hands off, you jerk...

40
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,779
Hey! He's alive!

41
00:04:26,854 --> 00:04:29,023
<i>What happened to the Jinchuriki?</i>

42
00:04:29,422 --> 00:04:31,216
I've met my quota...

43
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:33,564
Oh dear, oh my...

44
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,070
You barely made it, Deidara...

45
00:04:36,322 --> 00:04:38,557
You all right? Guess not.

46
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:43,609
Tobi, even the patience of
a saint has limits...

47
00:04:43,941 --> 00:04:47,236
Try saying something again and
I'll decide your cause of death myself...

48
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,479
No doubt it'll be death from explosion.

49
00:04:50,848 --> 00:04:52,738
<i>That's...past the limit...</i>

50
00:04:54,924 --> 00:04:56,050
Death from suffocation...

51
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,845
Oh! He's awake!

52
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,641
So I'm back here again...

53
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,519
Good job, Kakashi.

54
00:05:12,084 --> 00:05:13,085
Master...

55
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:14,939
Lady Tsunade...

56
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,944
No, Kakashi Sensei!
Don't push yourself.

57
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:25,000
I examined you earlier,
but you need to be in bed for a week.

58
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,298
It will take a few more days
until you can return to duty.

59
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,413
I guess that's how it goes...

60
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:34,863
Seems it will still take a while until
you can master the new Sharingan.

61
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:36,878
Yes...

62
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:39,902
Just rest. Try not to push yourself
for a while.

63
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:45,189
Team Guy should rest today too.
You can turn in the report later.

64
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,380
Yes!

65
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:47,898
Let's go, Shizune.

66
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,122
Yes.

67
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,808
Oh...Master!

68
00:05:57,177 --> 00:05:58,512
Is it regarding that matter?

69
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:00,090
Yes.

70
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,986
Did you tell Kakashi?

71
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:06,240
Since Kakashi Sensei has been
like that all this time, I haven't yet...

72
00:06:07,385 --> 00:06:08,386
How about Naruto?

73
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,747
I thought I should first consult you...

74
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,667
Give me the details.

75
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,409
It's what I heard from
the Akatsuki member, Sasori.

76
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,567
He said it was a reward for beating him...

77
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,561
In ten days...at Tenchi Bridge, huh...

78
00:06:31,937 --> 00:06:35,566
Four days has passed,
so it will be in six days.

79
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,565
Can you trust your source?

80
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:43,069
Considering the situation,
it's safe to say we can trust it.

81
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,655
What would you do if it were a trap?

82
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:50,660
There is a possibility that
Orochimaru is just bait,

83
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,579
and the Akatsuki will
be waiting there.

84
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,333
If it is a trap,
I'll fight with all my might!

85
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:01,462
Fight? Kakashi will be in bed
for more than a week.

86
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,298
But we only have six days left.

87
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,884
For that matter,

88
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:09,720
ever since Sasuke left,
Team Kakashi has been short on staff.

89
00:07:10,412 --> 00:07:11,413
Yes...

90
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:16,310
We can only add another member
and create a new team.

91
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,272
Lady Tsunade!

92
00:07:20,201 --> 00:07:20,868
What is it?

93
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:24,527
Then, you should send a different unit
to investigate the situation.

94
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:30,061
Even if you let Sakura go,
you should leave out Naruto!

95
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,681
Shizune...

96
00:07:35,942 --> 00:07:36,651
Yes.

97
00:07:36,771 --> 00:07:39,025
Like you, Sakura is
one of the few ninja

98
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,420
whom I can trust from
the bottom of my heart.

99
00:07:43,515 --> 00:07:47,200
I will definitely let Team Kakashi go,
mostly because Sakura is on it.

100
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,595
Wouldn't it be the same
if my team went?

101
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,514
It's not the same!

102
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:56,684
Sakura and Naruto are both
desperately trying

103
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,895
to seek out Sasuke,
their former team mate...

104
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,857
They wish to save Sasuke
more than anyone.

105
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:07,320
That strong desire will
lead the mission to success.

106
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:11,375
You and Sakura are different...

107
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:18,998
I understand, but,
for this mission, Naruto should...

108
00:08:19,086 --> 00:08:24,342
Now that he's heard this...
what would Naruto say?

109
00:08:27,483 --> 00:08:30,736
Let's search for our new team
member immediately!

110
00:08:37,787 --> 00:08:38,788
Later!

111
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:48,194
Sheesh, that impatient brat...
I wasn't done talking yet.

112
00:08:51,662 --> 00:08:54,790
<i>The child who was entrusted
with the First Hokage's necklace...</i>

113
00:08:56,285 --> 00:09:00,122
<i>Indeed, Naruto might not
be an ordinary kid.</i>

114
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:09,799
<i>Sasuke...</i>

115
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,073
I'll find two members to fill in the holes
left by Kakashi and Sasuke.

116
00:09:15,518 --> 00:09:16,978
Make sure to tell Naruto as well!

117
00:09:17,885 --> 00:09:18,886
Yes, ma'am...

118
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:33,614
Tsunade...

119
00:09:37,355 --> 00:09:41,109
I need to speak with you...
Let me see you for a moment.

120
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:50,548
Hmm, who might be good?

121
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,409
I need to think about this
very carefully.

122
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,138
It would be a pain

123
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:00,099
if I mistakenly choose someone
who would slow me down.

124
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,518
Plus, even if the person is skillful,

125
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,937
there might be a problem
with their personality,

126
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,064
and that will ruin the teamwork.

127
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,442
And Sakura is a sucker
for handsome boys,

128
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,236
so it would be dangerous
if he were too good-looking.

129
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,116
This is hard.

130
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,577
Long time no see, Naruto.

131
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,037
Huh?

132
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:25,875
Who are you?

133
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,923
Even though we haven't
seen each other for a long time,

134
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,636
you should remember
your comrade's face.

135
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:43,517
Because the one that spoke
to you will feel bad.

136
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:50,816
Oh...um...that really indirect speech...
could it be...?

137
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,861
Shino!

138
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:55,655
You finally remembered.

139
00:10:56,832 --> 00:10:59,695
If you cover up that much,
no one will know--

140
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,665
Shino, you're here early!

141
00:11:09,212 --> 00:11:10,154
Are you Kiba?

142
00:11:10,616 --> 00:11:11,825
Oh!

143
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:21,681
This smell! It is Naruto!

144
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:25,267
You knew it was me 'cause of that?

145
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,065
That dog, could it be...

146
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,692
What are you talking about?

147
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,194
Of course, it's Akamaru!

148
00:11:35,252 --> 00:11:36,420
Huh?!

149
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:39,824
Hey, did you grow?!

150
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,911
Naw, naw, naw...
Akamaru is the one that grew.

151
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:48,541
Do dogs become that big
in such a short amount of time?

152
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:53,348
Really? Since we're always together,
I can't really tell.

153
00:11:54,632 --> 00:12:00,096
Can't tell?! That Akamaru,
he used to be on your head!

154
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,138
Right, Shino?!

155
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:09,395
Seems like you noticed Kiba right away,
didn't you, Naruto?

156
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,983
<i>Oh shoot, he's upset.</i>

157
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,193
Na...

158
00:12:29,814 --> 00:12:32,191
<i>N-Naruto...</i>

159
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:40,146
<i>I heard that he came back
to the village.</i>

160
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,854
<i>Wh-What should I do?</i>

161
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:49,185
<i>I'm not ready yet since we haven't
seen each other for a while.</i>

162
00:12:49,574 --> 00:12:50,990
<i>What should I say...?</i>

163
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,802
<i>Um...Um...</i>

164
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,826
Oh, it's Hinata!

165
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,654
Why are you hiding?

166
00:13:08,495 --> 00:13:09,663
Huh?! Hinata.

167
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,543
Hey, Hinata, hey, Hinata!

168
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:18,005
Why do you always faint
after seeing Naruto?

169
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,801
Please! We need a new member!

170
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,928
You came at the wrong time,

171
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:28,599
we just got a mission and
we're waiting for Kurenai Sensei.

172
00:13:29,116 --> 00:13:33,287
Oh that's right.
Then, then...

173
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,059
Hey, Shino is...

174
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:41,028
You noticed Hinata
right away too, Naruto.

175
00:13:44,064 --> 00:13:45,649
<i>He is still sulking...</i>

176
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,994
<i>Naruto's voice...</i>

177
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:55,084
Hinata! Just shut up and
come with me!

178
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,045
<i>"Just shut up and come with me"...?</i>

179
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:02,049
<i>No way...no way...so suddenly...</i>

180
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:09,682
After all that fuss, I still got rejected.

181
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:17,982
In that case...
I guess I'll ask those guys.

182
00:14:18,707 --> 00:14:21,341
I told you already, haven't I?

183
00:14:21,468 --> 00:14:26,431
It's annoying, but I'm in charge
of the Chunin Exam.

184
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:29,635
I mean, yeah, we have
a long history together,

185
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,287
so I want to lend a hand.

186
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,082
But I'm not in a position
to do whatever I want.

187
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:41,630
The Fifth appointed me,
so she will kill me if I reject the offer.

188
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,386
I get scolded enough by my mother.

189
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:52,987
And here I was thinking
"I can count on Shikamaru,"

190
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,786
but you go on talking like
it's so annoying and all...

191
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,122
Even if you look at me
with those puppy eyes,

192
00:14:58,152 --> 00:15:00,154
what's impossible is impossible.

193
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,735
Then I will lend a hand!

194
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,821
Here! Shikamaru.

195
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,283
This is the lunch box that
your mom asked me to hand you.

196
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:13,329
Hey Choji, are you sure you can say
such an irresponsible thing?

197
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:17,041
Don't you have a mission
with Asuma and Ino?

198
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,836
I can't ignore what Naruto is saying.

199
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,840
I will try to discuss it
with Asuma Sensei.

200
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,176
Choji, thanks!

201
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:28,861
It's not going to help...

202
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:33,557
If you tell Asuma because
he works under Lady Tsunade.

203
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:46,737
Just like always,
you're still eating, huh?

204
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,282
You...are fatter than before...

205
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,728
<i>Over there, huh...?</i>

206
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:32,162
I haven't seen him before,
but he wears a Leaf head band.

207
00:16:32,469 --> 00:16:33,679
It was so sudden...

208
00:16:34,206 --> 00:16:39,294
I don't know what he is aiming for,
but we need to capture him and...

209
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,879
give him to the Interrogation Unit!

210
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,430
I'll assist you! Go Naruto!

211
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:55,639
Right!

212
00:17:05,735 --> 00:17:07,503
<i>Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll</i>

213
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:19,721
Naruto! Just keep charging at him!

214
00:17:21,685 --> 00:17:23,066
<i>Ninja Art: Shadow Sewing</i>

215
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,934
Who the heck...are you...?

216
00:17:46,426 --> 00:17:47,761
What did you want to talk about?

217
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:53,338
Since you two advisors are here,
this probably isn't going to be pleasant!

218
00:17:54,063 --> 00:17:57,859
Shizune recently came to us
seeking our advice...

219
00:18:02,689 --> 00:18:04,482
It's about Naruto Uzumaki.

220
00:18:06,893 --> 00:18:09,229
From now on,
do not assign missions

221
00:18:09,477 --> 00:18:14,316
with a possibility of contact with
the Akatsuki to Naruto Uzumaki...

222
00:18:14,498 --> 00:18:16,572
From here on,

223
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,889
make sure he works in a four-man squad
with more skilled shinobi

224
00:18:19,048 --> 00:18:23,844
and increase surveillance on him
as well as protection.

225
00:18:24,844 --> 00:18:27,844
Furthermore, you should decrease
the amount of missions

226
00:18:27,869 --> 00:18:30,062
you assign him as much as possible,

227
00:18:30,087 --> 00:18:32,673
and limit the scope of his activities.

228
00:18:33,339 --> 00:18:34,340
No way!

229
00:18:39,475 --> 00:18:43,273
Tsunade...
Naruto's not just an ordinary kid.

230
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,526
He's a Jinchuriki!

231
00:18:46,497 --> 00:18:49,450
Under normal circumstances,
the logical thing to do

232
00:18:49,475 --> 00:18:52,005
would be to keep him
in the village and under surveillance...

233
00:18:54,563 --> 00:18:57,733
It may not sound like it,
but this is a compromise.

234
00:18:58,795 --> 00:19:02,048
I agree that he should work
in a four-man squad.

235
00:19:02,649 --> 00:19:05,652
But Naruto shouldn't have
so many restrictions placed on him!

236
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,258
Even if we keep Naruto in the village,

237
00:19:08,283 --> 00:19:12,111
the Akatsuki will definitely come
after him, come after the Jinchuriki...

238
00:19:13,511 --> 00:19:15,959
Even in the recent incident
in the Hidden Sand Village,

239
00:19:15,984 --> 00:19:19,091
they went after Gaara, the Jinchuriki,
even though he was

240
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:22,244
in what was considered
the safest location in the village.

241
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:27,015
There's a strong possibility that
they'll take a similarly hard-line approach

242
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,792
in regards to Naruto as well.

243
00:19:29,164 --> 00:19:31,476
If Naruto stays on the move,

244
00:19:31,501 --> 00:19:34,621
the enemy won't immediately be able
to figure out what he's doing.

245
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,761
First of all, Naruto does have talent...

246
00:19:40,821 --> 00:19:43,365
He's a shinobi who should be
a great asset to the Leaf Village.

247
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:50,647
That's a pathetic objection, Tsunade.
You call yourself the Hokage?

248
00:19:52,364 --> 00:19:54,366
I'm trying to compromise too, you know!

249
00:19:54,855 --> 00:19:56,920
Then can you ensure that,
until then,

250
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,615
Naruto won't get taken out
by the Akatsuki?!

251
00:19:59,758 --> 00:20:03,074
And can you ensure that if the Akatsuki
takes the Nine-Tails from Naruto,

252
00:20:03,104 --> 00:20:07,428
it won't bring about bigger calamity
for the Leaf Village?!

253
00:20:08,938 --> 00:20:11,567
Naruto...won't be beaten!

254
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,729
I believe that...

255
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:19,927
If...that judgment turns out
to be mistaken...

256
00:20:20,451 --> 00:20:21,703
what will you do?

257
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:36,865
If perchance, the Hidden Leaf Village
and the Land of Fire

258
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:39,059
become endangered
by my decision...

259
00:20:42,715 --> 00:20:48,220
then as the Fifth Hokage,
I will protect them with my life!

260
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:05,264
Very well...If you're willing
to go that far, do as you like.

261
00:21:05,911 --> 00:21:06,912
However...

262
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:12,054
In exchange for that,
you will use the shinobi we select

263
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:14,998
as the additional members
of the four-man squad.

264
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:21,822
Fine.

265
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:26,118
Danzo...Come on in!

266
00:21:37,377 --> 00:21:40,005
Long time no see...
Princess Tsunade.

267
00:21:41,296 --> 00:21:43,464
To think you'd show up...

268
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:50,718
I see...So the new team members
will be from The Foundation, huh...?

269
00:21:57,879 --> 00:22:00,879
You're sure weak.

270
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:05,367
Are you sure you have any
"balls" with that kind of skill?

271
00:22:05,642 --> 00:22:08,312
Wha--?! You little!

272
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:10,331
Who the heck you are?!

273
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:18,795
We'll be seeing
each other again...Naruto.

274
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:21,920
Hold it!

275
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,186
Who was that...?

276
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:38,357
Choji! I thought you'd be here!

277
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,275
For crying out loud!

278
00:22:40,594 --> 00:22:43,597
Asuma Sensei's angry and
wants you to get a move on!

279
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:49,067
Sorry, Ino...
We got attacked by some weirdo...

280
00:22:49,372 --> 00:22:51,081
Some weirdo...?

281
00:22:52,124 --> 00:22:55,377
By weirdo, do you mean...
Isn't that Naruto?!

282
00:22:55,845 --> 00:23:00,141
No...when I said weirdo,
I didn't mean Naruto...

283
00:23:02,502 --> 00:23:05,130
Naruto! Long time no see!

284
00:23:05,597 --> 00:23:07,266
- Don't bother, Choji.
- How have you been!

285
00:23:07,664 --> 00:23:10,639
- This atmosphere's such a pain...
- Hey, you've gotta tell me your stories!

286
00:23:24,461 --> 00:23:29,299
So you will be arranging
the two additional team members?

287
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:31,460
No...

288
00:23:31,863 --> 00:23:33,406
Just one member...

289
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:38,093
So you also weren't expecting
the team leader, Kakashi...

290
00:23:39,092 --> 00:23:41,636
to be out of action, huh...?

291
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:46,149
Since Kakashi Hatake is
recuperating right now,

292
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:50,053
an additional member will be required
on Team Kakashi's next mission.

293
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:54,964
Then you should select
someone very skilled

294
00:23:54,989 --> 00:23:59,329
from the ANBU Black Ops under
your direct control to lead the team.

295
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,732
Yes! That would be good.

296
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,111
You've no objections, right, Tsunade?

297
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:12,159
Leave the selection to me.
Is that okay with you...?

298
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,836
Then, I'll do it as I please...

299
00:24:33,187 --> 00:24:34,730
L-Lady Tsunade...!

300
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:37,309
Geez, I don't like this!

301
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,562
I-I'm very sorry...

302
00:24:41,268 --> 00:24:44,990
But I had absolutely no intention
of betraying you...

303
00:24:45,263 --> 00:24:46,473
I'm not talking about you!

304
00:24:46,969 --> 00:24:47,970
What...?

305
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,779
I'm talking about that man.

306
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:56,213
<i>I'd also thought of having someone</i>

307
00:24:56,238 --> 00:24:58,403
<i>from the ANBU Black Ops
under my direct control replace Kakashi.</i>

308
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,832
<i>I have someone specific in mind...</i>

309
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:05,587
<i>But...I never thought they'd
suggest that from their end.</i>

310
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,024
<i>I totally thought they were
going to force</i>

311
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,009
<i>one of their own subordinates on me...</i>

312
00:25:15,552 --> 00:25:19,806
<i>Does this mean one person
is enough for the surveillance of Naruto?</i>

313
00:25:21,171 --> 00:25:24,674
<i>Or...are they after something else?</i>

314
00:25:25,846 --> 00:25:28,557
Uh...Umm...Lady Tsunade...?

315
00:25:30,347 --> 00:25:33,058
Of course, I've got tons of things
I want to say to you!

316
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,783
Yikes!

317
00:25:35,975 --> 00:25:39,186
That said, the formation of Team Kakashi
is a more immediate concern.

318
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,498
You're going to work really hard!

319
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,625
Oh, y-yes, ma'am!

320
00:25:50,596 --> 00:25:51,639
That was fast...

321
00:25:52,631 --> 00:25:55,194
I heard it was a matter of urgency...

322
00:25:56,879 --> 00:25:58,548
You know why you're here, right?

323
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:01,643
I have a general idea.

324
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:13,280
I want you to take Kakashi's place.

325
00:26:14,402 --> 00:26:17,864
It's an honor to be able to work
in Kakashi Senpai's stead...

326
00:26:18,899 --> 00:26:23,028
This isn't an ANBU Black Ops mission.
It will be a regular mission.

327
00:26:23,772 --> 00:26:26,567
Therefore, take off that mask
and I will give you a codename.

328
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:30,135
During this mission,
you'll be known as "Yamato."

329
00:26:33,168 --> 00:26:34,169
I understand...

330
00:26:35,199 --> 00:26:39,593
An additional member...a new recruit from
the ANBU Black Ops Training Division

331
00:26:39,618 --> 00:26:42,162
will be dispatched to Team Kakashi.

332
00:26:42,974 --> 00:26:45,268
From the...Foundation?

333
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,272
However...

334
00:26:47,972 --> 00:26:48,973
What is it?

335
00:26:49,554 --> 00:26:52,515
Keep a close watch on his actions.

336
00:26:53,677 --> 00:26:55,387
What...do you mean?

337
00:26:56,759 --> 00:26:59,811
Danzo recommended this new recruit.

338
00:27:00,964 --> 00:27:05,176
The Foundation has since been
disbanded and he has fallen from power.

339
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:09,544
But I still can't figure out
what he's thinking...

340
00:27:11,071 --> 00:27:12,906
Perhaps you're worrying too much...?

341
00:27:18,155 --> 00:27:19,156
Never mind...

342
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,182
Meet up with the team immediately.

343
00:27:22,956 --> 00:27:23,786
Yes, ma'am!

344
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,442
Hey, Sakura!

345
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,880
This is the spot...
where we're supposed to meet, right?

346
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,241
Yeah...No doubt about it.

347
00:27:41,288 --> 00:27:45,566
Nobody's here yet, considering...

348
00:27:45,591 --> 00:27:50,555
Did Granny Tsunade really arrange
new members for us?

349
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:55,215
It'll be okay. We just got here
a little too early, that's all.

350
00:27:55,368 --> 00:27:58,329
We've still got a little bit before
the meeting time.

351
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,599
I hope they don't turn out to
have the habit

352
00:28:00,624 --> 00:28:03,544
of showing up late like Kakashi Sensei...

353
00:28:07,751 --> 00:28:08,530
Hi...

354
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,778
Stop it, Naruto!

355
00:28:17,906 --> 00:28:20,173
I'm the replacement captain
for this team

356
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,908
while Kakashi is in the hospital.

357
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,160
Call me Yamato.

358
00:28:25,511 --> 00:28:30,045
You're comrades on the same team,
so you guys need to get along.

359
00:28:30,628 --> 00:28:34,730
C-Comrade...? This guy?

360
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,564
Sorry about before.

361
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:39,888
But thanks to that,

362
00:28:39,913 --> 00:28:43,750
I now know you're a worthless guy
with questionable "equipment."

363
00:28:43,927 --> 00:28:45,939
Hey, what did you say?!

364
00:28:45,964 --> 00:28:47,642
- We're going to be teammates!
- Damn you!

365
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:50,252
- Don't start fighting right at the start!
- Some things are inexcusable!

366
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:54,399
But you're kind of a rotten guy,
aren't you...?

367
00:28:56,302 --> 00:28:57,303
Is that so?

368
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,738
People won't like you if
you say stuff like that.

369
00:29:00,525 --> 00:29:05,322
I like nice...ugly women like you.

370
00:29:05,789 --> 00:29:07,179
Hey, what did you say?!

371
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:09,145
- Try repeating that, you twerp.
- Hey, do you remember...

372
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:10,671
- Don't try being cocky with me, cha!
- ...what you just said to Naruto?!

373
00:29:12,993 --> 00:29:17,623
At any rate, the four of us
will be starting our mission now.

374
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,101
And yet...

375
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:20,967
What's up with this?

376
00:29:21,549 --> 00:29:24,844
I don't have time to put you all in
a cage to get used to each other.

377
00:29:26,009 --> 00:29:27,553
Come on, introduce yourselves.

378
00:29:29,224 --> 00:29:30,350
Naruto Uzumaki.

379
00:29:31,616 --> 00:29:32,951
I'm Sakura Haruno.

380
00:29:33,994 --> 00:29:35,537
My name's Sai.

381
00:29:36,396 --> 00:29:39,357
Well, that's enough getting
acquainted for now.

382
00:29:40,209 --> 00:29:43,003
I will now explain our mission
as Team Kakashi.

383
00:29:44,198 --> 00:29:47,427
The four of us will now head
for the Tenchi Bridge...

384
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,998
capture the Akatsuki spy who has
infiltrated Orochimaru's organization...

385
00:29:52,475 --> 00:29:53,480
and bring him back here.

386
00:29:54,491 --> 00:29:56,478
It's an opportunity for us
to get information

387
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:57,728
on Orochimaru and Sasuke Uchiha.

388
00:30:00,941 --> 00:30:03,860
We will obtain a precious source
of information

389
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,721
with which we can draw up plans
for both the assassination of Orochimaru

390
00:30:06,746 --> 00:30:08,544
and the retrieval of Sasuke.

391
00:30:09,711 --> 00:30:11,213
Be sure to proceed with caution!

392
00:30:12,198 --> 00:30:13,066
Right!

393
00:30:13,517 --> 00:30:14,330
Yes, sir!

394
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:19,860
We'll meet at the main gate
in an hour!

395
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,375
We'll leave once you've equipped
yourselves with your ninja tools!

396
00:31:02,114 --> 00:31:03,115
Good move.

397
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,861
Listen carefully...
Never let your guard down.

398
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,494
What is it...Senpai?

399
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:27,668
Listen carefully.

400
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:31,270
The classified mission
you've been given is Lord Danzo's...

401
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:40,829
A cat, huh...?

402
00:31:42,844 --> 00:31:46,014
Anyway, Lord Danzo's vision...

403
00:31:46,386 --> 00:31:50,310
for the future of the village rests
upon this classified mission.

404
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,244
Failure is not an option.

405
00:31:54,994 --> 00:31:55,995
I know.

406
00:31:57,314 --> 00:31:58,174
Good.

407
00:32:01,473 --> 00:32:04,559
You're still carrying that
around with you...?

408
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:07,680
This is...

409
00:32:12,342 --> 00:32:13,141
In The Foundation,

410
00:32:14,302 --> 00:32:17,263
...you have
no name and no emotions.

411
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:21,105
You have no past...
and no future.

412
00:32:21,886 --> 00:32:23,178
There is only the mission...

413
00:32:29,331 --> 00:32:30,990
Never forget the will of
The Foundation,

414
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:35,227
which supports the giant tree known
as the Leaf Village from underground...

415
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:37,610
unseen.

416
00:32:46,956 --> 00:32:50,459
Oh, don't you look silly.

417
00:32:51,529 --> 00:32:52,572
Master Jiraiya.

418
00:32:52,831 --> 00:32:54,989
I heard you'll be in bed...

419
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,288
For a week, huh?

420
00:32:56,804 --> 00:32:59,057
Well, it seems so...

421
00:33:01,611 --> 00:33:04,113
Hey, don't force yourself.

422
00:33:06,175 --> 00:33:07,218
It's a get-well gift.

423
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:11,447
Both volumes of the deluxe edition
of "Make-Out Paradise."

424
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,117
You may have already read
it several times,

425
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,160
but it should at least help
pass the time.

426
00:33:17,191 --> 00:33:18,192
Thanks...

427
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:23,918
Surely this isn't the only reason
why you returned to the village.

428
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:29,674
I'll give you the details once he...
and Tsunade get here...

429
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,889
Sorry to keep you waiting!

430
00:33:36,698 --> 00:33:37,741
You're late.

431
00:33:39,301 --> 00:33:41,011
I got held up with this and that...

432
00:33:43,976 --> 00:33:44,977
Very well...

433
00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:47,016
Kakashi's waiting.

434
00:33:59,616 --> 00:34:00,950
It looks like they're here...

435
00:34:06,576 --> 00:34:08,495
It's been a long time, Senpai!

436
00:34:09,595 --> 00:34:10,596
You...

437
00:34:12,074 --> 00:34:14,618
I see. So you're the one
called Yamato, huh?

438
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:16,900
I get it...

439
00:34:17,518 --> 00:34:20,616
Yes! As of today,
I will be known as Yamato

440
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:24,062
while I work as the substitute captain
of Team Kakashi.

441
00:34:25,758 --> 00:34:27,009
Yamato, huh?

442
00:34:28,577 --> 00:34:30,643
I brought him here...

443
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:33,479
because there's something
I'd really like him to know

444
00:34:34,134 --> 00:34:36,864
since he'll be working as
the captain of Team Kakashi.

445
00:34:38,798 --> 00:34:40,393
And that is...

446
00:34:40,418 --> 00:34:43,555
the biggest reason why he was chosen
as Kakashi's replacement.

447
00:34:45,344 --> 00:34:47,047
Is this about Naruto?

448
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:54,929
You know that Naruto has
the Nine-Tailed Fox

449
00:34:54,954 --> 00:34:56,294
sealed inside him, right?

450
00:34:57,243 --> 00:34:57,899
Yes, I do...

451
00:34:58,821 --> 00:35:03,284
Sometimes the Nine-Tail's chakra
leaks out from inside Naruto's body...

452
00:35:03,617 --> 00:35:05,802
and takes the form of the Fox Spirit.

453
00:35:06,382 --> 00:35:09,023
We call it
the "Nine-Tail's Cloak."

454
00:35:10,503 --> 00:35:13,256
The Nine-Tail's Cloak, huh...?

455
00:35:14,756 --> 00:35:16,216
Does it happen often?

456
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,200
It happened on
our previous mission.

457
00:35:20,928 --> 00:35:23,931
I see...
So it appeared just as I thought...

458
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:28,000
Judging from the shape
of the chakra,

459
00:35:28,686 --> 00:35:30,939
the number of tails will
probably continue to grow...

460
00:35:31,617 --> 00:35:32,868
and eventually...

461
00:35:34,681 --> 00:35:35,680
there will be nine.

462
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,461
That's about the size of it...

463
00:35:40,228 --> 00:35:43,315
Master Jiraiya,
how many tails have you seen...?

464
00:35:47,852 --> 00:35:51,647
I've come close to dying twice
in my lifetime...

465
00:35:54,084 --> 00:35:57,588
The first time, I broke six ribs
and both arms,

466
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,407
and several of
my internal organs ruptured...

467
00:36:00,132 --> 00:36:03,177
It was when I was trying to peek
into the women's bath at a hot spring...

468
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:06,539
and you pounded me good, Tsunade.

469
00:36:07,139 --> 00:36:09,474
The other time was...

470
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:16,384
during Naruto's training

471
00:36:16,409 --> 00:36:20,413
when I saw the fourth tail
of the Nine-Tail's chakra.

472
00:36:21,514 --> 00:36:23,396
His anger became the trigger...

473
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,018
and the number of tails
he grew increased.

474
00:36:46,468 --> 00:36:51,848
He maintained consciousness up
until the third tail.

475
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,321
But by the fourth tail,

476
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:07,633
he had lost all rationality and was
controlled by destructive impulses.

477
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:12,297
He was just like a small version
of the Nine-Tailed Fox.

478
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:15,361
Even with the
Fourth Hokage's seal...

479
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:17,240
It can go that far?

480
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:18,903
Yes.

481
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:22,406
I don't know the details,
but I can say this for certain:

482
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:28,079
The Fourth Hokage's Sealing Jutsu
might very well...

483
00:37:29,062 --> 00:37:30,355
be weakening.

484
00:37:31,345 --> 00:37:32,429
There's more...

485
00:37:33,189 --> 00:37:36,108
It may appear that when Naruto
is in the Nine-Tails state,

486
00:37:36,269 --> 00:37:40,711
he's being protected by
the Nine-Tail's Cloak...

487
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:44,887
But in actuality, his body was
continuing to suffer damage

488
00:37:44,998 --> 00:37:47,292
from the Nine Tail's Cloak itself.

489
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:51,352
After the Nine-Tail's Cloak
dissipated,

490
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,980
his wounded body

491
00:37:54,181 --> 00:37:56,936
was healed by the Nine-Tails chakra
inside his body.

492
00:37:57,316 --> 00:38:00,111
But if he continues to get hurt

493
00:38:00,136 --> 00:38:02,444
and then heal at that
speed over and over...

494
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:07,510
Naruto's body will break down
and his life span will shorten.

495
00:38:08,168 --> 00:38:11,713
That's why we need you...
Yamato!

496
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:15,710
You, who has inherited the cells
of the First Hokage.

497
00:38:15,892 --> 00:38:21,282
Now you're the only one... who
can control the Jinchuriki Host.

498
00:38:22,267 --> 00:38:23,412
Fortunately for us,

499
00:38:23,672 --> 00:38:27,369
Naruto happens to be wearing
the First Hokage's necklace...

500
00:38:35,098 --> 00:38:35,774
Master!

501
00:38:37,644 --> 00:38:38,241
Oh...

502
00:38:40,258 --> 00:38:41,171
What is it?

503
00:38:41,836 --> 00:38:44,339
You should still have some time
left before you're to assemble.

504
00:38:45,521 --> 00:38:49,332
I wanted to have a few words
before we leave.

505
00:38:51,294 --> 00:38:52,629
I see...

506
00:38:53,356 --> 00:38:54,933
So it's already going badly, huh...?

507
00:38:55,392 --> 00:38:56,393
Yes...

508
00:38:57,028 --> 00:38:58,075
It can't be helped...

509
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:01,884
For the time being,
you keep Naruto under control.

510
00:39:03,021 --> 00:39:05,487
I'll do what I can, but...

511
00:39:08,787 --> 00:39:09,788
Come in!

512
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:16,937
<i>Who's that?</i>

513
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:21,600
Danzo, huh...? What is it?

514
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:25,211
Did you place
a skilled ANBU Black Ops member

515
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:30,868
as the captain of Sai's unit,
Princess Tsunade?

516
00:39:32,171 --> 00:39:34,411
I selected the best man I have.

517
00:39:34,436 --> 00:39:37,250
He's worked since
the Third Hokage's tenure.

518
00:39:38,153 --> 00:39:39,363
Very well...

519
00:39:40,156 --> 00:39:41,449
But I just hope...

520
00:39:41,937 --> 00:39:46,028
he hasn't been tainted by
the teachings of the Third Hokage.

521
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:50,123
Just like how the teachings
of your grandfather...

522
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,016
tainted the Third Hokage...

523
00:39:57,082 --> 00:39:59,876
I guess I'm more or less relieved.

524
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:06,957
Now I can enjoy my meals
without worries.

525
00:40:08,385 --> 00:40:09,386
Excuse me.

526
00:40:16,285 --> 00:40:18,537
Who the heck...was that?

527
00:40:20,115 --> 00:40:21,325
A long time ago...

528
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,380
he competed with
the late Sarutobi Sensei

529
00:40:24,948 --> 00:40:27,784
over the position of the Third Hokage.

530
00:40:29,628 --> 00:40:31,213
Unlike the Third Hokage,

531
00:40:31,245 --> 00:40:35,833
he's the leader of a hard-line
military faction based on rigid logic...

532
00:40:36,447 --> 00:40:37,910
and is Sai's superior.

533
00:40:39,518 --> 00:40:42,248
He hates me because
I'm the granddaughter of the First Hokage

534
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:45,443
as well as a student of
the Third Hokage who was a moderate.

535
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,055
Umm...

536
00:40:51,325 --> 00:40:52,367
Isn't it about time...?

537
00:40:52,933 --> 00:40:53,593
Oh!

538
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,307
That's right.
Isn't it almost time, Sakura?

539
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,229
Yes, it is...

540
00:40:59,936 --> 00:41:00,937
I'll be going now.

541
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,238
Okay...

542
00:41:17,416 --> 00:41:20,127
Team Kakashi, will now set out.

543
00:41:44,381 --> 00:41:46,171
Please don't stare at me like that...

544
00:41:47,312 --> 00:41:48,313
I'll pound you.

545
00:41:49,765 --> 00:41:53,644
Hey! You tick me off with
everything you say!

546
00:41:53,964 --> 00:41:56,508
I don't really mean it.

547
00:41:56,646 --> 00:41:57,814
You liar!

548
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:02,019
I'm just trying to portray myself
like that kind of character.

549
00:42:02,632 --> 00:42:05,010
You won't do at all!

550
00:42:11,816 --> 00:42:14,694
Hey! Hey! Don't act like that...

551
00:42:15,275 --> 00:42:17,593
in front of your captain, Naruto.

552
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,829
I'm sure Kakashi taught you

553
00:42:20,854 --> 00:42:24,755
that trust and teamwork
are most important to a team.

554
00:42:25,193 --> 00:42:28,405
He's not a member of Team Kakashi!

555
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:32,107
The other member of
our Team Kakashi is...

556
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:34,011
Sasuke!

557
00:42:37,273 --> 00:42:37,893
Well...

558
00:42:38,873 --> 00:42:40,102
He betrayed the Leaf

559
00:42:42,168 --> 00:42:43,878
and ran off
to serve Orochimaru...

560
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:50,734
I don't want to be lumped together
with a cockroach along the same lines...

561
00:42:54,317 --> 00:42:56,194
as Orochimaru.

562
00:42:56,687 --> 00:42:58,772
Y-You creep!

563
00:43:01,551 --> 00:43:06,973
Sai...Naruto still doesn't know you
very well.

564
00:43:07,576 --> 00:43:08,869
So he may have been out of line.

565
00:43:09,846 --> 00:43:12,015
Please forgive Naruto...

566
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:14,717
Sakura...

567
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:19,622
Thank goodness I've got at least
one kid who's less objectionable.

568
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:22,633
It's okay. It doesn't bother me.

569
00:43:23,295 --> 00:43:25,528
Really? Thank goodness.

570
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:33,235
You don't have to...forgive me.

571
00:43:34,088 --> 00:43:38,134
So that's another way of using
a fake smile, huh...?

572
00:43:40,149 --> 00:43:41,150
I'll remember that.

573
00:43:42,205 --> 00:43:45,398
How can you grin like that
after getting punched?!

574
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:49,918
A smile is the best way to get
through a tough situation.

575
00:43:52,859 --> 00:43:54,778
Even if it's a fake smile.

576
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:04,892
Surprisingly enough,
everyone gets fooled.

577
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,437
That's what it said in the book.

578
00:44:09,955 --> 00:44:12,583
It seems it doesn't really work
if I do it, though.

579
00:44:13,045 --> 00:44:14,338
You jerk!

580
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:15,611
<i>Four-Pillar Prison Jutsu!</i>

581
00:44:20,995 --> 00:44:25,416
I'll really toss you guys into
this cell if you keep fighting.

582
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:29,416
We don't have much time
until we get to the Tenchi Bridge.

583
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,695
<i>This is the secret jutsu that
only the First Hokage could use...</i>

584
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,672
<i>The Wood Style Ninjutsu!</i>

585
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,551
<i>How come Captain Yamato
can use the Wood Style Ninjutsu?</i>

586
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:44,598
As your peacemaker,
I offer you this suggestion.

587
00:44:45,673 --> 00:44:47,796
In order to improve your rapport,

588
00:44:48,183 --> 00:44:50,811
I can toss you guys into
this cell for a full day

589
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:54,191
or we can stay at a hot spring inn
for a night.

590
00:44:54,467 --> 00:44:55,605
Which would you prefer?

591
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,113
You guys probably don't really
know me all that well.

592
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:03,784
I prefer the kind and gentle approach,

593
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:09,665
but I'm not against controlling you
by fear either.

594
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:23,387
Sure enough, getting naked together like
this is a great way to bond, isn't it?!

595
00:45:28,028 --> 00:45:30,155
Don't you think so?

596
00:45:30,235 --> 00:45:31,945
Y-Yes, that's right!

597
00:45:32,808 --> 00:45:34,879
<i>His eyes are totally scary!</i>

598
00:45:35,112 --> 00:45:37,906
<i>He's already controlling us
with fear...</i>

599
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:42,200
Oh...So you do
have "equipment," after all.

600
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:46,708
Don't be looking!

601
00:45:47,089 --> 00:45:48,090
<i>Naruto...?</i>

602
00:45:48,522 --> 00:45:52,465
Shut up with all that talk about
my "equipment!"

603
00:45:57,432 --> 00:45:59,601
<i>For crying out loud, Naruto...
You're talking too loud!</i>

604
00:46:01,895 --> 00:46:03,146
You jerk!

605
00:46:05,261 --> 00:46:08,014
It's your fault I'm being laughed at...

606
00:46:08,811 --> 00:46:12,106
Aren't you glad that Sakura's pleased, too?

607
00:46:13,582 --> 00:46:14,875
Sakura...?

608
00:46:18,926 --> 00:46:19,927
Now then...

609
00:46:24,451 --> 00:46:26,245
I'm getting out now.

610
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:34,294
Before that, let me tell you
an interesting story, Naruto.

611
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:42,132
When Master Jiraiya was young,
there was one time when he almost died.

612
00:46:43,225 --> 00:46:47,605
He broke six ribs and both arms, and
several of his internal organs ruptured...

613
00:46:48,713 --> 00:46:54,135
It seems Lady Tsunade beat him up
real good with her incredible strength...

614
00:46:57,139 --> 00:47:00,334
This happened because
he did what you're now...

615
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,069
attempting to do...

616
00:47:05,842 --> 00:47:07,844
I wonder what Sakura would do...

617
00:48:12,804 --> 00:48:14,765
<i>What's he doing over there...?</i>

618
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:19,646
So you draw.

619
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:25,068
Is there something you want?

620
00:48:29,827 --> 00:48:32,830
You're foul-mouthed,
but you've also got a sensitive side, huh?

621
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:35,203
That's a surprise.

622
00:48:36,745 --> 00:48:42,119
That fake smile...So you're
still not through hitting me, huh?

623
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:44,881
Not quite...

624
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:51,637
I'm kidding!
I just came to check out your picture.

625
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:53,507
I was wondering what you were drawing.

626
00:48:53,532 --> 00:48:54,213
I see...

627
00:48:55,202 --> 00:48:58,605
At first, I thought you were drawing a
landscape since you're drawing out here...

628
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,146
But it's an abstract, huh?

629
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:05,484
What's the title of this drawing?

630
00:49:07,161 --> 00:49:08,734
It doesn't have one.

631
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,282
I've drawn tens of thousands
of pictures...

632
00:49:14,424 --> 00:49:16,217
but I've never given one a title.

633
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,373
So this doesn't have one, either...

634
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:28,674
But you're supposed to give
a title to a picture, right?

635
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:31,593
If it's a portrait,
you give it the name of the person...

636
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,303
Or with other pictures,

637
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:37,224
you use the situation,
your feelings or emotions at the time...

638
00:49:43,217 --> 00:49:47,847
To be exact, I couldn't title
one of my drawings even if I wanted to...

639
00:49:51,969 --> 00:49:56,682
Nothing comes to mind.
I don't...feel anything.

640
00:49:59,058 --> 00:50:00,059
Nothing...

641
00:50:10,934 --> 00:50:15,438
No wonder you can only say
such callous things!

642
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:17,973
It's about time for us to leave!

643
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,892
Captain Yamato told me
to come get you.

644
00:50:22,291 --> 00:50:23,292
Right.

645
00:50:30,915 --> 00:50:33,585
This drawing's nothing special!

646
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:37,865
You're right...
Just like your "equipment."

647
00:50:41,412 --> 00:50:43,998
I'm going to be straight with you!

648
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:46,626
I can't stand you!

649
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:50,881
If you've got a problem, stop the fake
smiles and tell me straight to my face!

650
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,331
I'll take you on anytime
you want to fight!

651
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:57,554
I've got...

652
00:51:00,193 --> 00:51:01,319
no problem with you.

653
00:51:04,439 --> 00:51:07,776
I don't care about you at all.

654
00:51:14,274 --> 00:51:15,483
Please go on ahead.

655
00:51:16,109 --> 00:51:17,819
I'll catch up once I've tidied up.

656
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:19,534
I'll help.

657
00:51:23,736 --> 00:51:26,072
This...isn't printed.

658
00:51:26,837 --> 00:51:28,339
Did you draw this, too?

659
00:51:28,999 --> 00:51:30,000
Yes.

660
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,829
Wow, it's a picture book, huh?

661
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:34,174
That looks cool.

662
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:37,010
Oh! Say...

663
00:51:37,942 --> 00:51:40,528
can I take a look
at it along the way?

664
00:51:41,361 --> 00:51:42,403
I can't let you see it.

665
00:51:43,142 --> 00:51:45,603
It's not finished yet...

666
00:51:48,224 --> 00:51:50,685
This is my older brother's book, so...

667
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:20,929
I guess this spot is okay.

668
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:24,766
<i>Wood Style: Four Pillar House Jutsu</i>

669
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:37,595
We'll camp out here tonight.

670
00:52:39,681 --> 00:52:42,225
I don't think you can call something
like this camping out.

671
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,751
Gather around, everyone.

672
00:52:52,339 --> 00:52:55,050
And I want to ask
you something, Sakura.

673
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:56,715
What is it?

674
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:59,676
It's about the Akatsuki's Sasori.

675
00:53:01,142 --> 00:53:04,290
For the time being, I've received a
file on Sasori from the Hidden Sand...

676
00:53:04,826 --> 00:53:06,870
But tell me in as much detail
as you can

677
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:10,937
about his personality, behavior,
mannerisms and habits if he has any.

678
00:53:11,961 --> 00:53:13,504
What's this about?

679
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:17,043
The spy who's infiltrated
Orochimaru's organization thinks

680
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:19,279
Sasori is going to meet him
at the Tenchi Bridge.

681
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:21,815
They might see us through immediately,

682
00:53:22,589 --> 00:53:24,841
but it's probably best to approach
by transforming into Sasori.

683
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:29,260
Being a spy is a very risky act, after all.

684
00:53:31,723 --> 00:53:34,142
Which means the spy is probably
being quite cautious.

685
00:53:35,923 --> 00:53:39,135
Then are you going to transform
into Sasori, Captain Yamato?

686
00:53:39,618 --> 00:53:40,869
I'll probably have to.

687
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,762
Also, assuming this turns out
to be an Akatsuki trap...

688
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:45,847
I'll approach him alone at first.

689
00:53:46,829 --> 00:53:49,540
You guys stand by until
I give you instructions.

690
00:53:50,141 --> 00:53:52,102
The way he talked being near death...

691
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:54,898
I don't think he was lying...

692
00:53:55,908 --> 00:53:59,662
And there was indeed a spy
called Yura in the Sand Village...

693
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:02,697
Either way, there's no doubting...

694
00:54:03,107 --> 00:54:05,818
that spy is probably
considerably powerful.

695
00:54:08,047 --> 00:54:09,632
Let's do this!

696
00:54:26,045 --> 00:54:29,006
Let me explain the mission in
a little more detail.

697
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:32,435
Our goal is just to arrest the target.

698
00:54:32,626 --> 00:54:37,173
We must not let him die,
even if we end up having to fight.

699
00:54:37,877 --> 00:54:42,215
We'll lose an important source of
information if the target is killed.

700
00:54:43,558 --> 00:54:46,311
And a mission like this is more difficult
than just killing an enemy.

701
00:54:47,161 --> 00:54:50,539
As this is a delicate mission,
I will make the first move.

702
00:54:51,498 --> 00:54:53,125
And you guys will be my back-up...

703
00:54:54,812 --> 00:54:59,149
The strategy is simple.
First, I restrain the target.

704
00:55:00,336 --> 00:55:04,048
Second, if I should fail
to restrain the target

705
00:55:04,303 --> 00:55:05,513
and this turns into a battle,

706
00:55:06,908 --> 00:55:09,077
you guys shift to battle formation.

707
00:55:09,712 --> 00:55:11,756
I will give you a signal when
I want you to do this.

708
00:55:13,128 --> 00:55:15,130
And in the event of the second case,

709
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:17,611
you are to operate with
the Buddy System.

710
00:55:18,529 --> 00:55:20,739
First, Sakura and I will be one team!

711
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:23,403
And...

712
00:55:23,706 --> 00:55:25,708
the other team will be...
Naruto and Sai!

713
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:33,246
Looking forward to it

714
00:55:34,555 --> 00:55:36,766
<i>There's that fake smile again.</i>

715
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,293
<i>Damn it!</i>

716
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:40,503
Captain Yamato.

717
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:42,630
What is it, Naruto?

718
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:46,468
Why...Why do I have to team up
with him?

719
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:53,099
Is there a problem?

720
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,311
U-Understood.

721
00:55:56,545 --> 00:55:57,546
Good.

722
00:55:57,718 --> 00:56:01,014
I think Naruto and I would
make a better team.

723
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:03,360
We've been working together
for a while

724
00:56:03,594 --> 00:56:05,680
and we know each other quite well, so.

725
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:09,449
You're the only medical ninja
on this team.

726
00:56:11,372 --> 00:56:13,332
We can't let you get hurt,

727
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:14,829
and that is why you'll be with me.

728
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,002
As Sai said earlier,

729
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:23,950
we can assume the enemy
will be very skilled...

730
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:27,092
A mistake in teamwork
could prove fatal.

731
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:31,471
tomorrow we'll devote half a day
to a team-play simulation.

732
00:56:31,961 --> 00:56:33,212
A simulation?

733
00:56:33,304 --> 00:56:34,305
That's right.

734
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:38,479
All I know about you guys is
what I've read in your files.

735
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:41,790
I want to get an idea

736
00:56:42,127 --> 00:56:44,629
of your fighting styles, battle skills
and jutsu types...

737
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,320
with my own eyes.

738
00:56:53,731 --> 00:56:54,732
Damn it!

739
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:56,788
Come at me for real!

740
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:09,676
Not nearly good enough.

741
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:33,867
<i>Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll</i>

742
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:41,458
No way am I letting go!

743
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:42,792
Wha--?!

744
00:57:44,744 --> 00:57:46,037
Why are you grabbing me, too?!

745
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:49,424
Hey, Sai! Do something about this!

746
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:50,425
<i>That way, huh?</i>

747
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:54,429
H-Hey! Where are you going, Sai?!

748
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:58,933
I've already captured Captain Yamato,
so hurry up and untie me!

749
00:57:59,267 --> 00:57:59,816
Huh?

750
00:58:02,662 --> 00:58:06,291
Damn it! Hey, Sai!

751
00:58:06,488 --> 00:58:10,158
Hurry up and untie this snake!

752
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:14,115
You did well to capture me, Sai.

753
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:15,658
You jerk!

754
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:17,076
What is it?

755
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:20,205
Don't you know what
the word "comrade" is?

756
00:58:22,501 --> 00:58:23,919
Of course I do...

757
00:58:26,575 --> 00:58:27,867
What of it?

758
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:33,593
That's not what I'm trying to say.

759
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,637
H-Hey, Naruto.

760
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:39,682
Please don't blame your lack of
individual competence on others.

761
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:40,892
What did you say?!

762
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:44,312
If you hadn't let the Captain get
a rise out of you...

763
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:47,357
I could've remained hidden
without being exposed.

764
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:50,944
And it wouldn't have been
this much trouble

765
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:52,946
to capture the Captain.

766
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:55,114
What do you mean?

767
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:58,284
Even if you go to the trouble
of transforming into me...

768
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:00,787
you'll be exposed as
a Shadow Clone immediately

769
00:59:00,953 --> 00:59:02,955
if you use one of your jutsu.

770
00:59:06,505 --> 00:59:09,807
Because of that,
the Captain saw through our strategy

771
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:13,174
and escaped into the forest
using a Substitution.

772
00:59:16,834 --> 00:59:20,212
Then why didn't you break
the jutsu right away

773
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:22,809
if you knew it was a Substitution?

774
00:59:23,476 --> 00:59:24,936
It isn't ideal to fight

775
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:27,855
while protecting someone who
has lost his cool.

776
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:30,149
All I did was consider the best way

777
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:33,778
to successfully complete the mission,
make a judgment and take action.

778
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:40,535
I won't acknowledge you.

779
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:43,746
I'll never acknowledge
the likes of you

780
00:59:43,941 --> 00:59:47,445
as a comrade or as a member
of Team Kakashi!

781
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:54,549
I guess these two just won't work
as a team, huh?

782
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,927
I wonder what Sasuke would've done.

783
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:03,349
Would he have fought
while protecting you?

784
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:07,895
He's a Team Kakashi
comrade to you, right?

785
01:00:10,777 --> 01:00:14,698
If you call someone who betrayed
his village and hurt you...

786
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:18,323
a comrade, that is.

787
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,575
If it's to save that comrade,

788
01:00:21,767 --> 01:00:23,185
then I'll do whatever it takes.

789
01:00:28,123 --> 01:00:30,751
I'll even team up with you.

790
01:00:33,895 --> 01:00:38,066
Why does he feel so strongly
about Sasuke?

791
01:00:39,641 --> 01:00:44,854
It's because Naruto...
thinks of Sasuke like a brother.

792
01:00:47,155 --> 01:00:49,407
You've got a brother, too,
don't you...?

793
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:53,399
You should understand
a little about how he feels.

794
01:00:53,895 --> 01:00:55,730
No, not at all.

795
01:00:58,868 --> 01:01:00,995
I told you about titles for
my drawings, right?

796
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:04,870
I have no such thing as emotions.

797
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:07,705
What do you mean...

798
01:01:08,424 --> 01:01:10,801
you don't feel anything
or have any emotions...?

799
01:01:11,919 --> 01:01:14,338
I mean just what I said.

800
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:26,933
Even so, if you have a brother,

801
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:31,020
you should be able to imagine
what it would be like to lose him, right?

802
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:34,982
Hm...? Yeah, well...
you could say that.

803
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:38,695
My brother's dead, after all.

804
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:40,697
Then all the more...

805
01:01:40,738 --> 01:01:42,949
I wonder if I should've looked like that.

806
01:01:53,796 --> 01:01:54,797
<i>This guy...</i>

807
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,630
That's enough talking.

808
01:01:58,423 --> 01:02:01,300
We're moving out pretty soon,
so gather your things.

809
01:02:02,298 --> 01:02:05,760
Sakura, in regards to Naruto...

810
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:11,018
Yeah, I guess I'd say you're nice to him.

811
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:13,896
I once read something
like this in a book.

812
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:19,318
I don't know why such feelings arise.

813
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:21,279
Guys.

814
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:22,989
Let's get a move on.

815
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:26,325
This will all come to nothing

816
01:02:26,367 --> 01:02:28,244
if we don't get there
by tomorrow afternoon.

817
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:10,411
Here he comes.

818
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:34,185
Captain Yamato...
I hope you do okay...

819
01:03:51,658 --> 01:03:54,327
It's been a long time, Lord Sasori.

820
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:58,584
It's been five years, hasn't it?

821
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:03,548
<i>Kabuto Yakushi...</i>

822
01:04:05,701 --> 01:04:06,910
Were you followed...?

823
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:11,222
We're okay...

824
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:13,891
How're you doing?

825
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:17,353
I've still got the strange sensation...

826
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:22,733
from when I remembered who I was
after your jutsu broke...

827
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:27,113
I still feel heavy-headed...

828
01:04:27,905 --> 01:04:29,282
Him again...?!

829
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:33,870
Who would've thought...
the Akatsuki spy was Kabuto.

830
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:37,498
I've got some questions for you.

831
01:04:38,082 --> 01:04:40,793
I don't have much time,
so please keep it short.

832
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:45,756
I risked my life to get here
without Orochimaru finding out.

833
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:49,844
I want information about

834
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:53,222
the location of his hideout
and Sasuke.

835
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:58,185
There are several hideouts.

836
01:04:58,811 --> 01:05:01,188
We move to
a different hideout each week

837
01:05:01,188 --> 01:05:03,357
so as not to get discovered.

838
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:06,694
Of course there are hideouts,

839
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:09,071
not just in the Village Hidden
in the Sound, but in other lands as well.

840
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:12,199
Spies for Orochimaru infiltrate
and act as informers.

841
01:05:13,879 --> 01:05:16,506
But there are all sorts of
means of transport,

842
01:05:16,611 --> 01:05:18,279
so they're not easily tracked...

843
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:19,999
Where is it now?

844
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:25,129
We're now in a hideout on a
small island on a lake to the north.

845
01:05:25,546 --> 01:05:27,350
We'll be moving again in three days.

846
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:30,801
Sasuke Uchiha is there as well.

847
01:05:38,653 --> 01:05:41,822
The sound of the wind is so loud
I can't hear anything.

848
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:46,758
You idiot! That's why we were
able to get this close.

849
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:51,864
The wind blows away the noise and
smell, so we can sit here unnoticed.

850
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:56,827
By the way...

851
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:11,093
Oh...it's just a wild rabbit.

852
01:06:21,757 --> 01:06:22,883
By the way...

853
01:06:23,383 --> 01:06:26,637
About what you ordered me to do,
Lord Sasori...

854
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:29,360
<i>Uh oh...</i>

855
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:32,196
<i>I still had a few more things
I wanted to ask him</i>

856
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:33,572
<i>while I had the chance, but...</i>

857
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:37,994
<i>I'll be discovered if the conversation
continues any further...</i>

858
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:41,872
Even after his reincarnation,

859
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:44,166
Orochimaru uses a jutsu
to apply a protector

860
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:46,669
to the cellular specimens
from his discarded body...

861
01:06:46,717 --> 01:06:50,429
And therefore I was unable
to analyze the cellular data.

862
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:52,132
I see...

863
01:06:56,303 --> 01:07:00,516
What's he doing?!
He should just grab him!

864
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:02,721
His opponent is Kabuto.

865
01:07:03,534 --> 01:07:09,414
Being overly cautious is just fine.
It's all over if he gets away, right?

866
01:07:16,721 --> 01:07:19,683
Now, please hand over
the item in question immediately.

867
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:23,539
I can't be hanging around here
any longer.

868
01:07:27,434 --> 01:07:30,187
If it's discovered that I'm here
with you like this...

869
01:07:31,244 --> 01:07:33,121
I'll be killed.

870
01:07:33,907 --> 01:07:35,116
Okay...

871
01:07:36,271 --> 01:07:37,439
<i>I can't hold out any longer...</i>

872
01:07:38,095 --> 01:07:40,014
<i>I just have to capture him
here and now!</i>

873
01:07:42,933 --> 01:07:44,935
That conversation sounds interesting.

874
01:07:47,087 --> 01:07:50,507
Would you guys let me
join in as well?

875
01:07:57,729 --> 01:07:59,940
If you hadn't pulled out
a kunai knife,

876
01:08:00,085 --> 01:08:02,379
I wouldn't have been able
to get away before I noticed.

877
01:08:04,729 --> 01:08:07,315
<i>It looks like he's
misunderstood nicely...</i>

878
01:08:08,422 --> 01:08:10,383
<i>I guess I still haven't been
discovered for now...</i>

879
01:08:11,843 --> 01:08:15,388
<i>But...now that Orochimaru
has shown up...</i>

880
01:08:16,311 --> 01:08:17,521
<i>What should I do?</i>

881
01:08:25,278 --> 01:08:29,074
That outfit...sure takes me back...

882
01:08:29,142 --> 01:08:30,269
Sasori...

883
01:08:31,141 --> 01:08:33,518
Did you follow Kabuto?

884
01:08:34,064 --> 01:08:37,735
Oh...I just thought I'd thank you.

885
01:08:38,572 --> 01:08:43,994
This kid you sent to me...
has come in very handy.

886
01:08:46,376 --> 01:08:49,379
The number of human subjects
necessary for the development

887
01:08:49,404 --> 01:08:53,158
of one new jutsu is over a hundred...

888
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:56,215
Thanks to this kid's medical ninjutsu,

889
01:08:56,240 --> 01:09:01,954
I've been able to reuse
test subjects several times.

890
01:09:02,691 --> 01:09:06,278
There's been a great shortage
of them, you see...

891
01:09:06,934 --> 01:09:08,519
What do we do?!

892
01:09:08,595 --> 01:09:11,682
We just have to stand by until
the Captain gives us instructions.

893
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:16,485
<i>It would probably be
impossible for me</i>

894
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:18,112
<i>to take on Orochimaru alone...</i>

895
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:22,412
<i>But even if I can stop Orochimaru
by working together with Kabuto...</i>

896
01:09:22,918 --> 01:09:26,797
<i>he'll find out immediately that
I'm not Sasori by my fighting style...</i>

897
01:09:28,278 --> 01:09:30,030
<i>Even so, if I call those three...</i>

898
01:09:31,324 --> 01:09:33,577
<i>then Kabuto will find out
who I am</i>

899
01:09:33,919 --> 01:09:35,754
<i>and it will become difficult
to capture him...</i>

900
01:09:37,046 --> 01:09:39,798
<i>Either I have to immediately call
the three and defeat both of them...</i>

901
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:42,636
<i>or retreat as is without calling them...</i>

902
01:09:44,064 --> 01:09:45,482
<i>I'll have to do one or the other...</i>

903
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:01,591
<i>Have I been discovered?</i>

904
01:10:01,616 --> 01:10:03,243
<i>No...that's not it...</i>

905
01:10:03,952 --> 01:10:05,578
<i>What's the meaning of this?!</i>

906
01:10:06,015 --> 01:10:07,391
<i>Multiple Striking Shadow Snake!</i>

907
01:10:19,029 --> 01:10:22,449
This is a Substitution created
with the Wood Style ninjutsu...

908
01:10:23,801 --> 01:10:26,136
You...could it be...?

909
01:10:26,762 --> 01:10:30,557
Lord Orochimaru.
Is this Sasori's real body?

910
01:10:31,101 --> 01:10:32,811
No...It isn't...

911
01:10:33,513 --> 01:10:37,309
Kabuto...you didn't know
his real face

912
01:10:37,517 --> 01:10:40,145
even though you were
his subordinate?

913
01:10:41,222 --> 01:10:43,808
He was a broody guy
who always stayed hidden

914
01:10:43,989 --> 01:10:45,908
inside his puppets, after all...

915
01:10:47,241 --> 01:10:48,534
What's the meaning of this...?!

916
01:10:49,353 --> 01:10:52,565
Kabuto...you were supposed
to be an Akatsuki spy...

917
01:10:53,208 --> 01:10:56,045
Weren't you caught in one
of Sasori's jutsu all this time?!

918
01:10:57,117 --> 01:11:01,162
Lord Orochimaru...broke that jutsu
for me ages ago...

919
01:11:03,702 --> 01:11:06,205
I can't believe you went
to the other side

920
01:11:06,387 --> 01:11:08,389
pretending to be caught
in one of Sasori's jutsu...

921
01:11:08,568 --> 01:11:10,570
Did you get caught in one
of Orochimaru's jutsu...?

922
01:11:12,290 --> 01:11:13,750
No...that's not it.

923
01:11:14,269 --> 01:11:18,482
I just empathize with
Lord Orochimaru's ideas.

924
01:11:19,045 --> 01:11:20,713
By the way, who are you?

925
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:23,608
The plan was to take
care of Sasori.

926
01:11:24,370 --> 01:11:25,746
But something has gone
quite wrong.

927
01:11:26,144 --> 01:11:30,899
Kabuto...I'll tell you
about this kid later...

928
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:32,768
More importantly...

929
01:11:33,178 --> 01:11:37,682
Why don't you call the three
little mice behind you over here?

930
01:11:41,116 --> 01:11:43,118
<i>So he's seen through
everything, huh...?</i>

931
01:11:47,321 --> 01:11:48,155
<i>There's the signal!</i>

932
01:11:53,291 --> 01:11:54,584
You again, huh...?

933
01:11:58,372 --> 01:12:00,249
I've seen that face often...

934
01:12:00,969 --> 01:12:02,971
And it looks like
the Nine-Tails kid's here, too...

935
01:12:03,982 --> 01:12:06,985
Maybe I'll play with you guys a little.

936
01:12:11,770 --> 01:12:17,193
Let's see who's gotten stronger,
you...or Sasuke.

937
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:27,885
Give Sasuke...

938
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:31,638
back...!

939
01:12:42,816 --> 01:12:45,235
"Give him back" is not the correct
way of saying it, Naruto...

940
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:49,698
Your reasoning is off...

941
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:53,285
Sasuke came to us
because he wanted to.

942
01:12:53,577 --> 01:12:56,163
For a man, you're too obsessed...
about the past.

943
01:12:56,524 --> 01:12:58,192
You need to resign yourself.

944
01:12:58,415 --> 01:12:59,458
Shut up, four-eyes!

945
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:02,669
You don't even know
how Naruto feels...

946
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:04,713
Stop acting so cold
about everything!

947
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:09,718
If you want to know about Sasuke,

948
01:13:10,118 --> 01:13:13,496
try forcing it out of me...

949
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:19,019
If you can, that is...

950
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:04,189
<i>What is that?</i>

951
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:16,243
Naruto...you've grown considerably
as a Jinchuriki Host.

952
01:14:17,372 --> 01:14:20,166
The power of the Nine-Tails
is rapidly getting stronger...

953
01:14:31,675 --> 01:14:34,928
You're starting to become more like
a Jinchuriki Host, aren't you...

954
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:38,015
Naruto?

955
01:14:53,141 --> 01:14:57,270
So that's why you were chosen to
keep watch over him, huh?

956
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:01,747
So my experiment turned out
to be somewhat useful...

957
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:07,836
The Leaf should be thanking me
a little more for this...

958
01:15:08,629 --> 01:15:09,588
Don't you agree...

959
01:15:09,963 --> 01:15:13,091
my adorable little test subject...?

960
01:15:17,387 --> 01:15:19,932
I thought all the test
subjects had died...

961
01:15:20,098 --> 01:15:23,310
but I never thought one of them
would still be alive.

962
01:15:23,695 --> 01:15:25,030
I see...

963
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:29,483
So it looks like we'll now
be able to obtain

964
01:15:29,943 --> 01:15:32,360
a sample from a product
of old research.

965
01:15:33,278 --> 01:15:35,322
More important than that...

966
01:15:35,822 --> 01:15:40,285
I'd like to test out how strong
my Sasuke has become...

967
01:15:40,771 --> 01:15:45,405
by having him
fight against Naruto.

968
01:15:46,966 --> 01:15:48,468
He doesn't...

969
01:16:00,264 --> 01:16:02,432
He doesn't belong to you...!

970
01:16:05,435 --> 01:16:07,312
Don't talk about Sasuke...

971
01:16:08,867 --> 01:16:10,869
in front of me...

972
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:15,070
like he belongs to you!

973
01:16:20,784 --> 01:16:21,785
That's...

974
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:24,997
<i>What's...that chakra?!</i>

975
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:28,041
<i>The air stings...</i>

976
01:17:18,723 --> 01:17:20,308
Interesting...

977
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,882
<i>With chakra alone...</i>

978
01:18:00,258 --> 01:18:02,219
<i>With chakra alone,
he caused this much damage...</i>

979
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:31,415
<i>Finally, the top-secret mission starts.</i>

980
01:18:37,796 --> 01:18:39,506
Sakura! Answer me!

981
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:44,886
<i>Did she hit her head
when she fell just now?</i>

982
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:48,515
<i>Passing out
at a time like this...!</i>

983
01:18:56,148 --> 01:18:57,190
<i>Wood Style Ninjutsu!</i>

984
01:19:05,699 --> 01:19:06,867
<i>I can't support it...!</i>

985
01:19:11,371 --> 01:19:13,373
<i>Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll!</i>

986
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:17,878
Sai!

987
01:19:25,927 --> 01:19:27,137
Sai! Help Sakura...

988
01:19:35,896 --> 01:19:36,897
Damn!

989
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:18,021
I see...

990
01:20:23,944 --> 01:20:26,780
You borrow
the power of the Jinchuriki...

991
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:28,698
And yet, that's
the best you can do...

992
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:43,296
You're still no match for Sasuke...

993
01:21:36,975 --> 01:21:38,268
Sasuke...?

994
01:21:42,814 --> 01:21:43,815
Sasuke!

995
01:21:44,649 --> 01:21:45,692
Wait...

996
01:22:05,837 --> 01:22:06,922
Wait for me...!

997
01:24:00,243 --> 01:24:04,831
This feeling...it's different
from before, isn't it...?

998
01:24:08,752 --> 01:24:09,753
Are you all right?

999
01:24:11,915 --> 01:24:12,916
Y-Yes...

1000
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:16,885
Hey...!

1001
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:19,054
Sorry...

1002
01:24:20,161 --> 01:24:22,121
I'm okay now...

1003
01:24:26,186 --> 01:24:27,312
What happened here...?

1004
01:24:28,495 --> 01:24:29,830
Naruto did it...

1005
01:24:30,106 --> 01:24:31,107
Where's Naruto now?!

1006
01:24:31,521 --> 01:24:35,775
On the other side of the bridge...
with Orochimaru.

1007
01:24:43,164 --> 01:24:44,832
The Jinchuriki...

1008
01:24:47,304 --> 01:24:49,848
It only stands to reason
that they'd want it too...

1009
01:25:08,144 --> 01:25:10,814
<i>Naruto is a real handful...</i>

1010
01:25:23,409 --> 01:25:24,911
What's that smoke...?

1011
01:25:27,205 --> 01:25:28,665
<i>I have a bad feeling about this...</i>

1012
01:25:31,501 --> 01:25:32,836
<i>Wood Clone Jutsu!</i>

1013
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:42,554
I'm counting on you!

1014
01:25:42,929 --> 01:25:43,930
Right.

1015
01:26:09,247 --> 01:26:11,291
<i>Wood Style: Doomed Wall!</i>

1016
01:26:26,598 --> 01:26:28,933
Simply unbelievable,

1017
01:26:29,559 --> 01:26:32,979
the things this child can do...

1018
01:26:54,083 --> 01:26:55,084
Oh shoot...

1019
01:27:56,813 --> 01:28:02,735
<i>Such incredible shockwaves...
Just from a swing of his arm, geez!</i>

1020
01:28:03,653 --> 01:28:05,947
<i>At this rate, there's no way
I can move closer...</i>

1021
01:29:51,844 --> 01:29:52,929
<i>What's this...?</i>

1022
01:30:13,116 --> 01:30:14,784
<i>That looks like trouble.</i>

1023
01:30:27,611 --> 01:30:31,239
<i>Anyone who has chakra
that high in density...</i>

1024
01:30:31,926 --> 01:30:33,386
<i>will most certainly die.</i>

1025
01:30:48,576 --> 01:30:50,620
<i>With that much high-density chakra
making it difficult...</i>

1026
01:30:50,645 --> 01:30:52,104
<i>for him to even move...</i>

1027
01:30:52,989 --> 01:30:56,701
<i>I wonder how he plans
to do battle with me...</i>

1028
01:31:14,782 --> 01:31:15,908
<i>So that's his move!</i>

1029
01:31:39,076 --> 01:31:40,703
<i>Triple Rashomon!</i>

1030
01:32:01,003 --> 01:32:02,212
<i>What an incredible battle!</i>

1031
01:32:03,242 --> 01:32:05,244
<i>Trying to find
an opening and fight...</i>

1032
01:32:05,269 --> 01:32:06,854
<i>It doesn't even seem like an option!</i>

1033
01:34:10,811 --> 01:34:12,021
Naruto is over here...

1034
01:34:28,454 --> 01:34:29,830
That thing is not human...

1035
01:34:42,427 --> 01:34:45,013
<i>Sai, what are you doing?</i>

1036
01:34:48,724 --> 01:34:51,018
Got it.
Continue to observe.

1037
01:35:00,152 --> 01:35:02,029
<i>Sakura!</i>

1038
01:35:17,505 --> 01:35:20,175
<i>That's...Naruto...</i>

1039
01:35:29,682 --> 01:35:34,311
<i>I can't pierce through...
even with my snake sword...</i>

1040
01:35:35,262 --> 01:35:37,707
<i>This is what Master Jiraiya
was referring to when he said...</i>

1041
01:35:37,732 --> 01:35:40,609
<i>he's "like a small Nine-Tailed Beast."</i>

1042
01:35:53,581 --> 01:35:57,710
<i>It's useless to go on fighting
with the snake sword...</i>

1043
01:36:22,237 --> 01:36:23,405
Wait! Sakura!

1044
01:36:25,555 --> 01:36:26,556
Naruto!

1045
01:36:29,499 --> 01:36:35,338
That's...that's enough!
I will save Sasuke, no matter what!

1046
01:36:36,248 --> 01:36:37,249
That's why...

1047
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:38,709
Naruto, it's enough...!

1048
01:36:46,068 --> 01:36:48,153
<i>Damn!
I didn't make it in time...</i>

1049
01:37:20,541 --> 01:37:21,709
<i>Naruto...</i>

1050
01:37:34,306 --> 01:37:35,307
<i>Now's the only chance...!</i>

1051
01:37:38,886 --> 01:37:40,179
<i>Hokage Style: Elder Jutsu</i>

1052
01:37:41,844 --> 01:37:43,471
<i>10th Edict on Enlightenment!</i>

1053
01:38:53,808 --> 01:38:54,809
<i>Naruto...</i>

1054
01:39:14,786 --> 01:39:16,329
<i>What is he trying to do?</i>

1055
01:39:26,438 --> 01:39:27,773
<i>Now is my chance...</i>

1056
01:39:38,269 --> 01:39:40,647
Looks like it's about time...

1057
01:39:43,771 --> 01:39:47,316
As expected,
this body is rejecting me.

1058
01:39:48,326 --> 01:39:52,205
Too bad, but the fun ends here.

1059
01:39:57,094 --> 01:40:02,599
Patience...Patience now...
I have Sasuke with me...

1060
01:40:07,333 --> 01:40:10,878
I am Danzo's man.
I am not your enemy...

1061
01:40:12,807 --> 01:40:15,018
I have something
to speak to you about.

1062
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:21,619
Danzo...that doddering old fool
is still alive, huh?

1063
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:24,101
So...

1064
01:40:24,231 --> 01:40:26,131
What do you want to talk about?

1065
01:40:27,110 --> 01:40:30,488
I have a message from Danzo
to Lord Orochimaru.

1066
01:40:31,483 --> 01:40:32,279
The truth is...

1067
01:40:32,304 --> 01:40:33,346
Before that...

1068
01:40:34,611 --> 01:40:38,282
Choose your words carefully
when you talk to me.

1069
01:40:43,203 --> 01:40:45,456
If not, you'll die.

1070
01:40:46,457 --> 01:40:51,128
I can only relay
what Danzo has told me.

1071
01:40:52,131 --> 01:40:55,593
If that does not satisfy you,
then I'll leave it up to you...

1072
01:41:11,523 --> 01:41:14,401
You really don't have
any manners do you, child?

1073
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:43,138
When you address someone
who's higher-ranking than you...

1074
01:41:45,099 --> 01:41:48,560
it's common courtesy
to show your face.

1075
01:41:55,692 --> 01:41:57,736
All right...I'll listen to you.

1076
01:42:34,940 --> 01:42:36,191
<i>His wounds are slow to heal...</i>

1077
01:42:37,524 --> 01:42:38,817
<i>Up to now,</i>

1078
01:42:39,211 --> 01:42:42,631
<i>Naruto has always been a fast healer
thanks to the Nine-Tail's chakra...</i>

1079
01:42:44,741 --> 01:42:47,035
<i>The fourth tail that Jiraiya
was talking about...</i>

1080
01:42:48,281 --> 01:42:50,783
<i>I wouldn't have imagined that
it would be as powerful as this...</i>

1081
01:43:01,498 --> 01:43:02,499
Captain Yamato...

1082
01:43:04,635 --> 01:43:06,970
That jutsu that stopped Naruto
earlier on...

1083
01:43:07,877 --> 01:43:10,853
Would you teach me that jutsu...?

1084
01:43:11,738 --> 01:43:12,906
That's not possible...

1085
01:43:15,564 --> 01:43:18,108
The only person in the Leaf Village
who can use that jutsu is me,

1086
01:43:18,734 --> 01:43:21,445
since I inherited the First Hokage's cells.

1087
01:43:24,072 --> 01:43:29,203
What that jutsu does is
forcibly suppress the Nine-Tail's chakra...

1088
01:43:30,343 --> 01:43:35,765
It's impossible for someone
without that special power to use it.

1089
01:43:37,502 --> 01:43:39,713
My power, which is just
an experimental copy,

1090
01:43:40,377 --> 01:43:43,338
is certainly not on the same level as
the First Hokage's original.

1091
01:43:47,696 --> 01:43:49,990
What Naruto has hanging around
his neck is something

1092
01:43:50,015 --> 01:43:52,142
that belonged to the First Hokage...

1093
01:43:53,769 --> 01:43:56,438
It's a chakra crystal that
only resonates

1094
01:43:57,034 --> 01:43:58,744
to the First Hokage's chakra.

1095
01:43:59,274 --> 01:44:03,076
With that necklace,
one can control a Jinchuriki's chakra.

1096
01:44:04,588 --> 01:44:06,840
It is said that this power is
the very reason

1097
01:44:07,241 --> 01:44:09,409
that the First Hokage
became the Hokage.

1098
01:44:11,703 --> 01:44:14,957
And it's also the reason that I was
chosen to be the Captain of this team...

1099
01:44:23,799 --> 01:44:24,967
It's always like this...

1100
01:44:31,515 --> 01:44:34,184
All I can ever do for Naruto...

1101
01:44:36,509 --> 01:44:38,136
are the smallest things.

1102
01:44:47,656 --> 01:44:50,158
It's not important whether
the things you do are large or small.

1103
01:44:52,869 --> 01:44:54,121
What's important...

1104
01:44:55,325 --> 01:44:58,119
is the magnitude of the feelings
you have for Naruto.

1105
01:45:01,578 --> 01:45:04,747
Sakura...I can tell that when
I look at you.

1106
01:45:08,491 --> 01:45:09,569
You truly...

1107
01:45:10,001 --> 01:45:11,628
S-Sakura...

1108
01:45:20,147 --> 01:45:22,399
Owww!

1109
01:45:25,152 --> 01:45:26,111
Naruto...!

1110
01:45:29,323 --> 01:45:31,033
What happened to me...?

1111
01:45:31,786 --> 01:45:36,249
I was chasing that jerk Orochimaru...
and then...

1112
01:45:38,136 --> 01:45:41,055
And then, what did I do after that?

1113
01:45:41,918 --> 01:45:43,628
Hey, Sakura...

1114
01:45:45,797 --> 01:45:46,798
Huh?

1115
01:45:47,093 --> 01:45:49,262
Why are you crying, Sakura?

1116
01:45:50,825 --> 01:45:52,201
I just got something in my eyes...

1117
01:45:53,180 --> 01:45:57,017
That acid-tongued Sai said something
abusive to you again, right?

1118
01:45:57,435 --> 01:45:58,436
Like, "You're ugly!"

1119
01:45:58,602 --> 01:45:59,770
Or, "You're Herculean!"

1120
01:46:02,606 --> 01:46:04,107
That jerk!

1121
01:46:06,151 --> 01:46:09,321
Sai hasn't called me Herculean...!

1122
01:46:10,197 --> 01:46:12,074
R-Really?

1123
01:46:12,467 --> 01:46:14,970
Don't make up stuff...
You jerk!

1124
01:46:21,041 --> 01:46:23,460
By the way...
Captain Yamato...

1125
01:46:24,044 --> 01:46:25,045
Where's Sai?

1126
01:46:26,588 --> 01:46:29,257
That's everything that Danzo
asked me to convey.

1127
01:46:31,718 --> 01:46:33,762
That's extremely interesting...

1128
01:46:35,343 --> 01:46:38,346
Why should I believe it?

1129
01:46:50,570 --> 01:46:51,780
What's going on here?

1130
01:46:52,447 --> 01:46:55,283
Just calm down...Kabuto.

1131
01:46:56,351 --> 01:47:00,188
That child is going to be one of
our subordinates starting today.

1132
01:47:01,057 --> 01:47:04,477
Can you trust...this guy...?

1133
01:47:05,190 --> 01:47:07,776
Look inside that envelope.

1134
01:47:10,758 --> 01:47:12,426
It's for you, from Danzo.

1135
01:47:32,487 --> 01:47:33,488
This is...

1136
01:47:34,281 --> 01:47:35,282
What does it say?

1137
01:47:40,365 --> 01:47:44,077
Kabuto, let go of that child

1138
01:47:44,770 --> 01:47:47,189
We're taking that child along with us.

1139
01:47:51,251 --> 01:47:52,460
Sai...was it?

1140
01:47:52,873 --> 01:47:54,541
Shall we go then...?

1141
01:48:06,646 --> 01:48:07,647
Just as I thought...

1142
01:48:12,444 --> 01:48:13,445
<i>The bridge...</i>

1143
01:48:14,827 --> 01:48:18,331
I did plant one on him back at
the hot springs, just in case...

1144
01:48:19,157 --> 01:48:21,576
Oh well. I'll continue
the pursuit as is.

1145
01:48:23,038 --> 01:48:24,039
I might not look it,

1146
01:48:24,414 --> 01:48:26,333
but pursuit is actually one of
my strong points.

1147
01:48:35,258 --> 01:48:36,259
Captain Yamato...

1148
01:48:36,646 --> 01:48:38,147
Oh yeah...

1149
01:48:39,239 --> 01:48:40,240
Right now, Sai is...

1150
01:48:41,368 --> 01:48:44,037
traveling together with Orochimaru.

1151
01:48:47,919 --> 01:48:48,920
Together with...?

1152
01:48:51,298 --> 01:48:52,466
What does that mean?

1153
01:48:53,617 --> 01:48:55,535
Both of you follow me.

1154
01:49:08,444 --> 01:49:10,446
The earth is still soft.

1155
01:49:23,348 --> 01:49:25,183
The bridge is busted...

1156
01:49:25,745 --> 01:49:27,580
and this place is in
such an awful state...

1157
01:49:29,490 --> 01:49:31,951
What the heck...happened?

1158
01:49:32,782 --> 01:49:33,824
Don't you remember?

1159
01:49:36,861 --> 01:49:40,448
<i>So it's just as
Master Jiraiya said, huh...?</i>

1160
01:49:45,054 --> 01:49:46,890
Come to think of it...

1161
01:49:47,180 --> 01:49:49,224
why was I unconscious?

1162
01:49:56,909 --> 01:49:59,620
You were unconscious because
you got creamed by Orochimaru.

1163
01:50:03,858 --> 01:50:06,527
Are you serious?!
Damn!

1164
01:50:17,010 --> 01:50:19,137
Sai's things are scattered
all over the place...

1165
01:50:21,990 --> 01:50:24,159
But why is this here...?

1166
01:50:25,476 --> 01:50:27,770
If he had to leave something
so valuable behind,

1167
01:50:29,042 --> 01:50:32,712
it demonstrates that he was in
a tense state in front of Orochimaru.

1168
01:50:33,710 --> 01:50:36,212
You seem to know that as if
you witnessed it yourself.

1169
01:50:36,963 --> 01:50:38,006
Until earlier on...

1170
01:50:38,031 --> 01:50:41,200
I placed my Wood Clone here, and
was in communication with it,

1171
01:50:41,225 --> 01:50:43,853
using the wireless radio
implanted here.

1172
01:50:46,389 --> 01:50:48,376
What happened to Sai?

1173
01:50:48,975 --> 01:50:53,313
After Sai's...conversation
with Orochimaru,

1174
01:50:54,715 --> 01:50:57,134
he went away with Orochimaru
and Kabuto.

1175
01:50:58,485 --> 01:50:59,986
What does that mean?!

1176
01:51:00,445 --> 01:51:01,655
What did they talk about?

1177
01:51:01,946 --> 01:51:03,365
They were talking a distance away...

1178
01:51:03,365 --> 01:51:04,949
so I couldn't make out
the conversation.

1179
01:51:06,159 --> 01:51:07,744
I wonder what
they were talking about?

1180
01:51:08,703 --> 01:51:10,955
He might have been kidnapped
and taken away.

1181
01:51:11,289 --> 01:51:14,756
No, it seems that he approached
Orochimaru of his own volition...

1182
01:51:14,781 --> 01:51:17,583
and handed him something.

1183
01:51:18,588 --> 01:51:21,966
It was just like he was trying
to cozy up to Orochimaru...

1184
01:51:22,258 --> 01:51:24,552
W-Wait a minute!

1185
01:51:24,803 --> 01:51:28,181
Even a disgusting guy like him
wouldn't betray us, would he?

1186
01:51:28,306 --> 01:51:30,058
No, there is a possibility...

1187
01:51:35,313 --> 01:51:38,108
Captain Yamato, do you know
a person named Danzo...?

1188
01:51:38,191 --> 01:51:39,567
Yes, I know him.

1189
01:51:39,734 --> 01:51:41,736
Who is...that guy?

1190
01:51:42,362 --> 01:51:45,782
A man from the Hawk Faction who
in the past opposed the Third Hokage.

1191
01:51:46,282 --> 01:51:47,367
He's Sai's boss...

1192
01:51:48,368 --> 01:51:51,204
And an old gramps who doesn't
think well of the Third Hokage's will.

1193
01:51:52,247 --> 01:51:56,418
Danzo may be using Sai to make
some kind of move.

1194
01:52:01,256 --> 01:52:02,340
It's possible that...

1195
01:52:02,968 --> 01:52:04,553
Sai may have been given
a mission...

1196
01:52:04,676 --> 01:52:06,928
by Danzo that is separate from ours...

1197
01:52:07,721 --> 01:52:09,764
There is a possibility that
he was charged...

1198
01:52:10,032 --> 01:52:12,075
with some kind
of top-secret mission...

1199
01:52:13,184 --> 01:52:16,354
So he's just using our mission...

1200
01:52:16,595 --> 01:52:19,765
in order to make contact
with Orochimaru?!

1201
01:52:20,525 --> 01:52:21,568
That's the gist of it.

1202
01:52:25,196 --> 01:52:27,615
This may sound like
an over-the-top theory...

1203
01:52:28,867 --> 01:52:32,912
but it is not outside the realm
of possibility...so listen carefully.

1204
01:52:38,752 --> 01:52:39,753
Danzo...

1205
