1
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,554
They're thorns from a poisonous cactus…

2
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:16,933
You're from the Sand…

3
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,310
You should be familiar with
the plant life of your homeland.

4
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:20,478
It's pitiful.

5
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:21,563
Kouji…

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,523
Please get the bandages ready.

7
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:25,316
I know, Ameno.

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,744
I'm going to extract the poison
directly out of him.

9
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,704
<i>Medical Water Style:
Water Mosquito!</i>

10
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:55,764
Are you sure you don't want it?

11
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,852
A Medical Ninja stays
on the frontlines

12
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,354
in order to help comrades
stay alive.

13
00:01:03,662 --> 00:01:05,664
We're not here to battle.

14
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,568
I'm not a Medical Ninja,
so that doesn't include me.

15
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,236
What was that?

16
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:12,113
Just joking!

17
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,741
I'd never live it down
if word got around

18
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,285
that I took a scroll from
an injured comrade.

19
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,079
Just hurry and get lost.

20
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,783
Would it have been okay
if they weren't comrades?

21
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,173
Did you do a sensory check
on the area, Shishio?

22
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:38,181
I could swear this wave pattern is…

23
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:46,421
H-Hey, can we slow down a bit?

24
00:01:46,446 --> 00:01:49,826
See, Sakura? Choji is worried
about you.

25
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,320
He's worried about you, Ino.

26
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:55,949
If you need to rest, just say so.

27
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,745
Anyway, I hope you're right.

28
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:01,913
About what?

29
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,207
An oasis, what else?!

30
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,751
You're the one who said that
even with the scroll,

31
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,629
we'd never make it to
the central tower without water!

32
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:10,672
Come on, guys…

33
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,715
You're to blame for this
in the first place!

34
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,825
That brings back memories
of the last Chunin Exam!

35
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,754
<i>All right! Let's find some weaklings!</i>

36
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:56,051
Shut up! That was
a tactical withdrawal!

37
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,553
We decided to tread carefully
after we collected the scrolls,

38
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,889
and look at the result!

39
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:03,516
We should've just headed
straight for the goal

40
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,602
instead of going with
your strategy, Sakura!

41
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:06,769
What?!

42
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,813
I've been listening
to you patiently…

43
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,273
but you agreed to it!

44
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,233
W-Well…

45
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:17,113
At the time, I thought…
it would be easier.

46
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,699
You just drank too much water, Ino!

47
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,075
You bloated blister!

48
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:25,371
Bloated blister? Is that right?

49
00:03:25,396 --> 00:03:28,649
Well, you'd have to drink a hundred times
more than me to fill yours up!

50
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,212
If drinking water is all that it takes,
I'd be happy!

51
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,882
Now, now, you two.
Get over it.

52
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,675
– Shut up, you fa…
– Shut up, you fa…

53
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,211
– It's out!
– It's out!

54
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,182
Let's get out of here!

55
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,814
<i>No way!
Is this trauma?</i>

56
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:52,857
Choji!

57
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,694
<i>Mind Transfer…</i>

58
00:03:58,446 --> 00:03:59,781
<i>It's faster than it looks…</i>

59
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,909
<i>I can't do Mind Transfer.
Then I'll—!</i>

60
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,877
<i>Super Expansion Jutsu!</i>

61
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,510
Way to go, Choji!

62
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:21,886
Clobber it just like that!

63
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,349
We did it!

64
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,115
Cha!

65
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:56,421
You know, tell us if you have
a move like that up your sleeve!

66
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,850
For an instant,

67
00:04:58,105 --> 00:04:59,857
you probably have
more power than me.

68
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,751
I-I doubt that…

69
00:05:04,653 --> 00:05:05,654
Let me see.

70
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:14,522
Even if we're Medical Ninja, it's hard
to heal your own fist, right?

71
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,606
Looks like it's the two women
and the fatso from the Hidden Leaf.

72
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:29,579
The team of Sakura Haruno…
Lady Tsunade's apprentice.

73
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,790
That powerful fatso's team? Interesting.

74
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:37,420
Besides that, this team
has two Medical Ninja.

75
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,631
Two Medical Ninja on one team?

76
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,550
Whatever. Let's get going.

77
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,094
Since you don't plan on
ambushing them, right?

78
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:52,702
We have to reach
the oasis sometime today,

79
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,437
or else our provisions
will be in trouble!

80
00:05:55,287 --> 00:05:57,623
We have water that I extracted out
of that giant scorpion,

81
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,067
so we can still get by!

82
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,779
Well, I refuse to "get by"
with scorpion water

83
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,305
for the rest of the Chunin Exam!

84
00:06:08,457 --> 00:06:09,917
It's just like you planned.

85
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,726
I didn't account for this.

86
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:22,715
You are...

87
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,335
Please hand over your scroll.

88
00:06:32,603 --> 00:06:35,690
Then we will allow you access to
the water in the oasis up ahead.

89
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,564
And if you wish, medical treatment.

90
00:06:38,723 --> 00:06:41,213
What?!
We don't need to be treated by you!

91
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:43,947
We have our own medical specialist!

92
00:06:45,332 --> 00:06:46,333
Ino…

93
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:47,031
Yeah.

94
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:51,503
Besides, no one told us the oasis's
water belonged to anyone.

95
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,454
You tell 'em Choji!

96
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,832
Sakura, you tell 'em too!

97
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,622
We don't need treatment,
but we definitely need water.

98
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,255
Hey, we'll lose even before we fight,
if you get weak like that!

99
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,297
Ino!

100
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,011
<i>Sand Formation: Shisa!</i>

101
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,060
Ino!

102
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:17,979
Are you all right?

103
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:21,098
So she was a pawn?

104
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:26,279
Jumping within my range of attack
without taking any precautions…

105
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:31,742
I heard this team had two Medical Ninja
and was curious…

106
00:07:32,722 --> 00:07:35,308
But she doesn't have
the cool-headed judgment

107
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,373
required of a Medical Ninja.

108
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,022
How disappointing that
my expectations were unwarranted.

109
00:07:42,494 --> 00:07:44,872
Which means...No more negotiating.

110
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:46,365
Seems that way.

111
00:07:47,198 --> 00:07:48,491
You just fired us up!

112
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,512
Choji and I will break through this!

113
00:07:56,644 --> 00:07:58,646
<i>Medical Water Style:
Water Praying Mantis!</i>

114
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,449
Don't worry.

115
00:08:11,703 --> 00:08:15,457
Once we get your scroll,
I'll treat your wound.

116
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,707
<i>It's not an ordinary Water Style blade.</i>

117
00:08:20,213 --> 00:08:22,549
<i>It's as sharp as a chakra scalpel.</i>

118
00:08:24,803 --> 00:08:26,305
<i>She's very strong!</i>

119
00:08:27,415 --> 00:08:28,625
<i>Saganken: Sand Stone Fist!</i>

120
00:08:37,749 --> 00:08:39,042
Damn! I missed!

121
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,022
<i>Partial Expansion Jutsu!</i>

122
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:52,532
<i>This sand fist…is equal to
my size and power…</i>

123
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:53,866
<i>But…</i>

124
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,475
<i>…it's ridiculously hard.</i>

125
00:09:02,273 --> 00:09:04,984
<i>And it must be pretty heavy…</i>

126
00:09:05,604 --> 00:09:06,981
<i>But he easily…</i>

127
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,594
Let's see who's stronger!

128
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,689
Amazing...To see through
successive attacks…

129
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,111
Damn it…

130
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,753
Your attack is boring!

131
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,469
He just took a blind swing!

132
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,890
You seem to be having a hard time.

133
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,726
Not as hard as you.

134
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,573
You two…
are fooling around too much.

135
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:06,233
Did you finish infusing chakra?

136
00:10:07,716 --> 00:10:08,717
Here I go!

137
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,651
<i>Polarized Sand Formation:</i>

138
00:10:11,603 --> 00:10:13,021
<i>Burning Sand Camouflage!</i>

139
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:22,913
They disappeared!

140
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,044
Choji!

141
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,679
This is not the time…

142
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,181
to worry about the others.

143
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,155
Now, how will you fight
a foe you can't see?

144
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:57,740
Choji…

145
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:00,058
If we scatter,
we'll be at a disadvantage.

146
00:11:01,238 --> 00:11:02,448
You got my back?

147
00:11:02,753 --> 00:11:03,837
U-Uh-huh!

148
00:11:12,521 --> 00:11:14,857
Sakura...Choji…

149
00:11:32,237 --> 00:11:34,489
At 8 o'clock, distance 10…

150
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:38,239
At 3 o'clock, distance 5…
Two of them.

151
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,867
At 6 o'clock, distance 30.

152
00:11:57,528 --> 00:11:59,840
It's no good!
My chakra's disrupted…

153
00:12:00,148 --> 00:12:01,191
I can't tell!

154
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,937
If my concentration
lapses even a little,

155
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:11,756
my Sensory Perception
doesn't work.

156
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,860
I can't use this in actual battle…

157
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:17,945
I'm sorry, Choji.

158
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:21,223
I wanted to get this down
by the Chunin Exams, but…

159
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,631
It's okay.

160
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,827
The fact that you can even
do Sensory Perception

161
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,287
is amazing to me.

162
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:29,397
You can't use it in real battle,
that's for sure.

163
00:12:31,653 --> 00:12:32,571
However…

164
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:34,576
It's these little tricks
you think you can't use

165
00:12:34,601 --> 00:12:37,104
that somehow work in
an unexpected surprise attack.

166
00:12:50,668 --> 00:12:51,669
Not yet...

167
00:12:52,217 --> 00:12:53,510
…we can't let it end yet.

168
00:12:53,963 --> 00:12:56,675
Nah...Let's finish things up here.

169
00:13:01,157 --> 00:13:02,450
Choji, watch out!

170
00:13:02,795 --> 00:13:05,540
How do I watch out for
a foe I can't see?

171
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,620
Figure it out yourself!

172
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,163
In the direction of six o'clock!

173
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,177
All right!

174
00:13:23,489 --> 00:13:25,032
Thank you, Shikamaru!

175
00:13:29,538 --> 00:13:32,199
Found them! The three of them
are on the move.

176
00:13:32,224 --> 00:13:33,225
I sense their chakra…

177
00:13:33,592 --> 00:13:35,093
The enemy should be
heading this way.

178
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:38,468
Since when do you
have sensory powers?

179
00:13:39,272 --> 00:13:40,273
That's amazing!

180
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:43,948
"Right?!"
…is what I want to say,

181
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,243
but in actual combat,
it's still difficult for me.

182
00:13:47,633 --> 00:13:50,719
If I have the time
to concentrate I can do it.

183
00:13:51,553 --> 00:13:52,512
I see…

184
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:55,918
Well, no enemy will give us
the luxury of time…

185
00:14:01,217 --> 00:14:03,386
If there's no time to spare,
you just have to steal it!

186
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:05,277
I pretended to be a pawn
to buy time

187
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,720
and use Sensory Perception.

188
00:14:07,569 --> 00:14:10,349
Don't be so proud of yourself
for fooling us.

189
00:14:10,754 --> 00:14:13,048
We thought he got you.

190
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,854
Now, now…

191
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,344
We're taking this.

192
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:25,739
You can't buy time
for damage this small.

193
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,036
What? What the hell is going on?!

194
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,016
I never expected a Sensory
type to be among you.

195
00:14:41,703 --> 00:14:43,622
<i>That counter attack was
perfectly executed…</i>

196
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,593
<i>I'm shocked it didn't work…</i>

197
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:51,833
<i>But the speed with which
she undid the damage…</i>

198
00:14:54,132 --> 00:14:56,051
I had kneaded chakra earlier

199
00:14:56,284 --> 00:14:58,077
for this Medical Water Style
Water Jellyfish.

200
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,691
If it weren't for
this self-healing...

201
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,152
We would have been in trouble.

202
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,077
Kouji, Shishio…

203
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,788
I'm out of Water Jellyfish,
but can you still continue?

204
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,334
Sure...This time,
I won't allow any sensing!

205
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,256
Choji, Sakura!

206
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,507
I'll track them with…

207
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,345
Th-This is a sensory barrier?!

208
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,474
<i>Blinding Sand Formation: Noise!</i>

209
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,352
<i>I won't let you sense us anymore!</i>

210
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,064
Ino!

211
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,845
<i>Be grateful to Ameno.</i>

212
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:49,365
<i>She gets really upset
if I do too much damage.</i>

213
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,136
What? What is it?
You're so antsy.

214
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,390
Are you so worried about
your daughter's Chunin Exam?

215
00:16:15,065 --> 00:16:16,233
I won't make any excuses, but…

216
00:16:16,866 --> 00:16:17,950
my daughter's what you call

217
00:16:17,975 --> 00:16:20,853
a jack-of-all-trades
and master of none.

218
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,815
Before I knew it,

219
00:16:22,846 --> 00:16:24,848
she turned her back on
training in our Secret Jutsu…

220
00:16:24,998 --> 00:16:27,250
and took up
Medical Ninjutsu training.

221
00:16:28,072 --> 00:16:31,200
I mean...She's been such
a burden to you, Lady Tsunade…

222
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,783
Don't worry about it.

223
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:37,871
Besides, I don't intend to
make her a Medical Ninja.

224
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:39,419
Huh?

225
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,876
I just thought it would come
in handy someday.

226
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,255
Since she skipped out training
for the Secret Jutsu

227
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,631
to come learn under me...

228
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,178
<i>If I can't sense them,</i>

229
00:16:53,203 --> 00:16:54,579
<i>I can't get into
Mind Transfer mode.</i>

230
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:58,475
<i>So I'll contact those two
with Mind Transmission...</i>

231
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,880
<i>Sakura, Choji...Can you hear me?</i>

232
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:05,559
<i>I-I hear you.</i>

233
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,986
<i>Ino! Can you do something
to sense the enemy?!</i>

234
00:17:09,505 --> 00:17:11,132
<i>My Sensory Perception
is being blocked.</i>

235
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,199
<i>But…I think the enemy's attack
follows a pattern.</i>

236
00:17:14,224 --> 00:17:16,143
<i>That's pretty obvious!</i>

237
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,667
<i>The enemy attacks
from your blind side.</i>

238
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:27,771
<i>Like just now,
I can see Choji's opponent.</i>

239
00:17:27,995 --> 00:17:30,289
<i>Except, it's already too late
when I see one coming.</i>

240
00:17:31,074 --> 00:17:32,075
<i>I knew it…</i>

241
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:46,049
You can communicate with
several people at once.

242
00:17:46,295 --> 00:17:48,088
This is
the Mind Transmission Jutsu.

243
00:17:49,398 --> 00:17:51,984
Transmission of intel is
a basic part of battle strategy.

244
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,239
As long as the enemy
doesn't find out,

245
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,699
it's a huge military asset.

246
00:17:56,224 --> 00:17:59,060
You learned an awesome jutsu, Ino!

247
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,080
I-I guess…

248
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,833
The more useful the jutsu,
the riskier it is.

249
00:18:05,176 --> 00:18:07,136
That goes for the Mind
Transmission Jutsu as well.

250
00:18:07,675 --> 00:18:09,343
If you misjudge your level of skill

251
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,715
and carelessly increase
the jutsu's intensity,

252
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,992
in the worst case you could die.

253
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,930
By increasing the intensity,
do you mean

254
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:21,100
widening the scope or increasing
the number of people involved?

255
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:24,311
I guess that would change
how we strategize…

256
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,896
Yes…

257
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,398
There are levels within
the Mind Transmission Jutsu

258
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,025
that correlates to the user's skill.

259
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,862
Transmission speed, the scope, the
number of people in the conversation…

260
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:36,323
These change according
to the user's level.

261
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,700
And when truly mastered,

262
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:42,079
you are able to transmit
what is most precious.

263
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,541
What is most precious?

264
00:18:46,482 --> 00:18:48,109
The Mind Transmission Jutsu…

265
00:18:48,134 --> 00:18:51,470
In other words, using your body
to communicate what is in someone's heart.

266
00:18:52,273 --> 00:18:53,382
On the battlefield,

267
00:18:53,407 --> 00:18:55,663
when you can feel the intensity of
your teammates thoughts for you…

268
00:18:55,688 --> 00:18:57,633
that gives you more courage
than anything.

269
00:18:59,257 --> 00:19:02,342
<i>I've only scratched
the surface of this jutsu…</i>

270
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,686
<i>If only I had spent
more time training…</i>

271
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,900
<i>If only I had spent the time
I used training in Medical Ninjutsu,</i>

272
00:19:09,925 --> 00:19:11,927
<i>training with Dad…</i>

273
00:19:12,967 --> 00:19:15,386
<i>That happens because
your chakra control is too rough.</i>

274
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:19,449
<i>Control your chakra more delicately!</i>

275
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,327
<i>Lady Tsunade…</i>

276
00:19:25,812 --> 00:19:27,438
<i>Sakura, Choji, listen up!</i>

277
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:31,461
<i>Huh?!</i>

278
00:19:31,486 --> 00:19:33,029
<i>You can do that?!</i>

279
00:19:33,223 --> 00:19:35,600
<i>It doesn't matter...I have to do it.</i>

280
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,344
<i>I have to raise my level
much, much more.</i>

281
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,303
<i>Mind Transmission Jutsu!</i>

282
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,268
<i>Send Sakura's thoughts to Choji!</i>

283
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:50,939
<i>It worked!</i>

284
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,774
<i>Send these thoughts to Choji.</i>

285
00:19:59,216 --> 00:20:00,217
<i>I did it!</i>

286
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:04,745
I saw something, but at this rate,
I won't make it in time.

287
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:07,265
<i>Transmitting takes too long.</i>

288
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:10,250
<i>I have to send Sakura's thoughts
straight to Choji.</i>

289
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,549
<i>I won't give up! More! More!</i>

290
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,260
<i>I will raise the level of
my Mind Transmission!</i>

291
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,392
<i>More…more…</i>

292
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:31,021
<i>More…more!</i>

293
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,406
<i>My thoughts this time!</i>

294
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,664
Cha!

295
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,305
How?

296
00:21:09,349 --> 00:21:11,434
How could you...Impossible!

297
00:21:13,244 --> 00:21:16,206
Intense feelings decided
the outcome of this fight.

298
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,151
Ino, are you still up to it?

299
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:19,219
Of course!

300
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,156
Then let's finish this.

301
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,324
Right.

302
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,451
W-Wait!

303
00:21:26,476 --> 00:21:28,228
– No excuses!
– No excuses!

304
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,296
Extreme delicacy is
required to perform

305
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,006
the Secret Ninjutsu of
the Yamanaka Clan.

306
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:42,159
I have no doubt that the chakra control
skill required in Medical Ninjutsu

307
00:21:42,184 --> 00:21:43,978
will come in handy.

308
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:45,889
Lady Tsunade…!

309
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:51,476
It may seem she's taking a detour,
but she's learning what she must.

310
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:56,940
And you, as her father must
be well aware of that.

311
00:21:59,911 --> 00:22:02,455
<i>In time, you will surpass me…</i>

312
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:06,867
<i>In fact, I have faith that you will
become the best of the Yamanaka Clan!</i>

313
00:22:09,863 --> 00:22:12,198
Those guys were pretty formidable.

314
00:22:12,507 --> 00:22:15,343
Who knows what would have
happened if you weren't here Ino.

315
00:22:15,412 --> 00:22:19,250
Don't say that. You two bought
me time, that's why.

316
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:24,134
If you two didn't give it your all,
who knows…?

317
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,764
<i>I'm sorry, Dad, for skipping out
on my training.</i>

318
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,266
<i>Please forgive me, Lady Tsunade…</i>

319
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:34,210
<i>For thinking that Medical Ninjutsu
was an easy way out.</i>

320
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:40,558
<i>Your guidance and training
in Medical Ninjutsu helped me to grow.</i>

321
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:45,197
<i>Calm decision-making,
delicate chakra control…</i>

322
00:22:45,804 --> 00:22:48,849
<i>Everything is pushing me in
the direction that I'm destined to go.</i>

323
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:52,289
All right, let's do our best
and reach our goal!

324
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,372
Okay.

325
00:23:02,611 --> 00:23:07,408
Hey, we have both scrolls,
so let's go straight for the goal.

326
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,513
I wish we could,

327
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:12,140
but there's a high risk of
getting ambushed.

328
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:15,769
We should stick to Sakura's plan
and take the detour.

329
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,106
Sakura…?

330
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,193
Sakura!

331
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:38,031
Sakura…

332
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,506
Two dams…

333
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:49,403
Next, I'm going to teach you
the jutsu to revive all the organs,

334
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,929
the entire system.

335
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:54,433
It's called the Ninja Art:
Mitotic Regeneration Jutsu.

336
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,477
Ninja Art…
Mitotic Regeneration?

337
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,565
This isn't a jutsu that revolves
around healing skills.

338
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:04,719
It's the same kind of
regeneration jutsu

339
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:06,538
that the First Hokage used.

340
00:24:07,485 --> 00:24:09,738
The First Hokage had
such enormous chakra that

341
00:24:09,966 --> 00:24:12,169
he could activate it
without weaving signs.

342
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,787
I don't have
that kind of immense chakra.

343
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,832
So…there's one more jutsu
I will teach you.

344
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,585
It's called
The 100 Healings Jutsu.

345
00:24:22,486 --> 00:24:24,237
The 100 Healings Jutsu?

346
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,757
Even I don't have the kind of chakra
that the First Hokage had.

347
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,343
So I developed this jutsu.

348
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,599
By using it, you can keep
a huge amount of chakra in reserve.

349
00:24:36,421 --> 00:24:38,673
By combining these two,

350
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,645
the body will continue
to regenerate and

351
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,464
you will not die during that time.

352
00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:44,498
A-Amazing…

353
00:24:44,903 --> 00:24:48,778
However, there's a problem with
the 100 Healings Jutsu.

354
00:24:50,292 --> 00:24:53,837
Not only does it require extremely
delicate chakra control,

355
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:57,204
you must amass chakra
for three years.

356
00:24:58,424 --> 00:24:59,789
Three years…?

357
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,215
You have a constant amount
of chakra infused.

358
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,551
Well, you must maintain
that state for three years!

359
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:32,489
<i>I have to maintain this condition
for three years?!</i>

360
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:45,670
Sakura!

361
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:54,486
Due to the effect of
the 100 Healings Jutsu,

362
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:57,514
your normal chakra level
has become extremely low.

363
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,976
This will only be a hindrance
during healing and in battle.

364
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,771
At this rate, I can't allow you
to perform any surgery

365
00:26:04,966 --> 00:26:06,718
or go out into the battlefield.

366
00:26:11,663 --> 00:26:13,873
<i>The 100 Healings Jutsu creates
a smaller secondary dam</i>

367
00:26:13,898 --> 00:26:17,777
<i>in which to store
the chakra reserve…</i>

368
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,870
<i>If I keep two dams of chakra and</i>

369
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,290
<i>make sure I use each of them
for their specific purpose…</i>

370
00:26:23,926 --> 00:26:27,805
<i>I should be able to perform surgery
as well as fight in battles!</i>

371
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,854
<i>My optic nerve is connected.</i>

372
00:26:52,228 --> 00:26:52,770
Foo!

373
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:54,080
Wait!

374
00:26:54,105 --> 00:26:55,315
Where do you think you're going?!

375
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,550
We have both scrolls!

376
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,617
So let's head straight
for the central tower!

377
00:26:58,717 --> 00:26:59,884
I don't want to!

378
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:02,579
I still haven't made any friends!

379
00:27:02,904 --> 00:27:05,670
I just want to have
a little more fun first!

380
00:27:06,017 --> 00:27:07,435
Have you already forgotten?!

381
00:27:07,736 --> 00:27:10,405
We're taking the Chunin Exams to make
a name for the Hidden Waterfall!

382
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,330
We may not beat
the 97-minute record

383
00:27:12,355 --> 00:27:14,524
set by the Kazekage
when he was a genin,

384
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:17,385
but we can still shoot
for first place!

385
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,720
Yahoo!

386
00:27:19,657 --> 00:27:20,888
– She's not listening!
– She's not listening!

387
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:22,974
Calm down.

388
00:27:23,336 --> 00:27:24,337
Yeah…

389
00:27:26,389 --> 00:27:29,642
Foo, the village chief would
be disappointed if he saw you now!

390
00:27:30,417 --> 00:27:31,418
Shibuki...?!

391
00:27:33,274 --> 00:27:36,236
Yes, bringing glory
to the Hidden Waterfall

392
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,937
is Lord Shibuki's greatest wish!

393
00:27:42,124 --> 00:27:43,125
<i>Shibuki…</i>

394
00:27:46,967 --> 00:27:48,896
Think of how he would feel!

395
00:27:50,365 --> 00:27:52,659
Okay, okay!

396
00:27:53,106 --> 00:27:54,941
I guess I have no choice.

397
00:27:55,823 --> 00:27:58,742
<i>The lord's wish always
comes first with Foo.</i>

398
00:27:59,305 --> 00:28:00,431
<i>I don't know why,</i>

399
00:28:00,699 --> 00:28:02,935
<i>but she calmly obeys whenever
his name is mentioned.</i>

400
00:28:03,301 --> 00:28:04,385
Foo! Not again!

401
00:28:04,521 --> 00:28:05,397
Where are you going?!

402
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,602
To the central tower, where else?!

403
00:28:08,459 --> 00:28:10,794
– You're going the wrong way!
– You're going the wrong way!

404
00:28:20,338 --> 00:28:23,174
<i>With the Sand Eye,
there's no danger to him physically.</i>

405
00:28:23,947 --> 00:28:26,575
<i>But as long as Gaara
doesn't change his mind…</i>

406
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:30,041
<i>We can't let down our guard.</i>

407
00:28:31,423 --> 00:28:32,272
Gaara…

408
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:35,726
Shall we break for dinner?

409
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:38,633
I agree. It's getting late.

410
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:42,220
No, I'm okay right now.

411
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:43,513
All right.

412
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:44,865
He snubbed us.

413
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:45,797
Sure did.

414
00:28:58,477 --> 00:28:59,687
Where are we headed?!

415
00:29:00,126 --> 00:29:01,794
We're heading to the central tower.

416
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,576
Wait, we don't have two scrolls!

417
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,203
Use your head!

418
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:07,862
The earth here is to our advantage!

419
00:29:07,952 --> 00:29:11,656
Actually, we don't have the
"Earth" scroll, just the "Heaven" one.

420
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,420
That's not what I meant.

421
00:29:17,268 --> 00:29:21,647
Any team with both "Heaven" and
"Earth" scrolls will be targeted.

422
00:29:22,164 --> 00:29:25,317
So they'll head straight for the
central tower as quickly as possible.

423
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:29,726
But, traps are laid throughout
the surrounding area.

424
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,604
Except this eastern route.

425
00:29:33,118 --> 00:29:35,523
The eastern route is clear?

426
00:29:35,548 --> 00:29:38,593
Then everyone will
be using that route!

427
00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:42,832
Except…this place has naturally
occurring hidden quicksand pits.

428
00:29:44,425 --> 00:29:46,883
Once you fall in, you can't get out.

429
00:29:47,215 --> 00:29:49,583
So we'll get there first, wait patiently,
and then steal a scroll.

430
00:29:50,051 --> 00:29:51,052
How's that plan?

431
00:29:51,077 --> 00:29:52,287
You're so smart.

432
00:29:52,478 --> 00:29:54,731
It sounds a bit cowardly though.

433
00:29:55,398 --> 00:29:57,317
Do you want to pass
the Second Exam or not?

434
00:29:57,823 --> 00:29:59,632
Don't be a hypocrite.

435
00:29:59,746 --> 00:30:01,733
You're right. Let's do it.

436
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:41,515
So you're Houichi.

437
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,672
You look quite young.

438
00:30:45,291 --> 00:30:47,877
Yes, I am young.

439
00:30:48,593 --> 00:30:51,146
But I've studied
the Priest Bunpuku's power

440
00:30:51,171 --> 00:30:53,914
to mold currents since I was a child.

441
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,813
Bunpuku, you say?

442
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:58,606
Yes.

443
00:30:59,241 --> 00:31:01,911
Gaara has become the Kazekage,

444
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,279
but he still poses
a threat to this village.

445
00:31:04,962 --> 00:31:06,589
As long as he remains,

446
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,742
measures are necessary
to control this fear.

447
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,558
The Chunin Exams present
the ideal opportunity

448
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:15,668
to extract Shukaku, the One-Tail.

449
00:31:16,277 --> 00:31:20,039
Ultimately, this means
that he must die.

450
00:31:21,058 --> 00:31:21,982
Yes.

451
00:31:23,197 --> 00:31:25,783
<i>First, we must make sure
the Kazekage is alone,</i>

452
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:28,136
<i>and lure him to the tower.</i>

453
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:31,856
<i>I'll now release the barrier</i>

454
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:33,725
<i>that obstructed long-range
sensory perception.</i>

455
00:31:34,568 --> 00:31:38,602
<i>This place is called Demon Desert
because it's difficult to survive</i>

456
00:31:39,009 --> 00:31:42,402
<i>its massive sandstorms
once you get stuck in one.</i>

457
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,320
<i>That's why
the Sand Investigative Unit</i>

458
00:31:45,345 --> 00:31:48,640
<i>uses long-range sensory perception
and stays on guard.</i>

459
00:31:57,927 --> 00:31:58,784
What?!

460
00:31:58,982 --> 00:32:00,192
What is that?

461
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,712
Hey, this is bad!

462
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:07,336
<i>However, if long-range sensory
perception wasn't functioning,</i>

463
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:08,927
<i>what would happen?</i>

464
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,519
<i>By now, chaos must be
breaking out at headquarters…</i>

465
00:32:27,122 --> 00:32:29,834
A massive sandstorm is forming!

466
00:32:30,861 --> 00:32:32,967
Why wasn't it
detected until now?!

467
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:35,536
I didn't sense anything unusual!

468
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,580
He's right. I didn't detect
anything either.

469
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:40,667
Could someone be interfering
with our long-range sensory...?

470
00:32:40,976 --> 00:32:43,979
Like blocking your perception
with a barrier?!

471
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,173
Who would do this, and why?

472
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:51,284
More important, we need safety
measures for the exam participants first!

473
00:32:51,309 --> 00:32:54,354
Isn't survival part of this exam?

474
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:57,100
This sandstorm is way too big!

475
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,769
There will be hell to pay
if they all die.

476
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,020
Damn it!

477
00:33:01,088 --> 00:33:02,589
What a hopeless bunch.

478
00:33:03,991 --> 00:33:06,118
The Second Exam will
be postponed temporarily…

479
00:33:06,248 --> 00:33:08,417
and we'll lead all
the exam participants into shelters.

480
00:33:08,906 --> 00:33:11,241
I leave the Kazekage to you two,

481
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:14,701
because it seems like he's going
to take matters into his own hands...

482
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,079
Make sure he does not
set foot outside.

483
00:33:17,193 --> 00:33:18,194
– Yes sir!
– Yes sir!

484
00:33:21,212 --> 00:33:22,297
Are you ready?

485
00:33:22,582 --> 00:33:23,371
– Yes, ma'am!
– Yes, ma'am!

486
00:33:23,396 --> 00:33:25,253
Teams One to Three,
come with me.

487
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:27,030
The rest, with me!

488
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,010
Let's go!

489
00:33:52,254 --> 00:33:55,633
I can't believe we didn't detect
a sandstorm of this magnitude.

490
00:33:56,197 --> 00:33:58,658
Who could have interfered?

491
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:01,122
I just hope
nothing bad happens…

492
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:03,458
Yeah. I agree.

493
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:09,505
What is this—?!

494
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,591
It is a sandstorm!

495
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,676
I know that!

496
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,930
So this what a giant sandstorm
of the Demon Desert is like.

497
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,224
It's way bigger than I imagined.

498
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:22,226
We can't stay here, that's for sure.

499
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:26,647
This is bad…

500
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,693
That's why I insisted on
going straight to the central tower!

501
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,739
Watch out!

502
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,368
What's wrong?

503
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,455
Uh, nothing.

504
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,041
A sandstorm huh…?

505
00:34:45,262 --> 00:34:46,764
This gives us
the home-court advantage.

506
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,961
I really wouldn't say that now...

507
00:34:50,265 --> 00:34:51,676
This is bad.

508
00:34:52,329 --> 00:34:54,538
We haven't seen a storm
this massive in quite a while.

509
00:34:54,832 --> 00:34:57,543
Yeah, I hope the exam participants
are all right.

510
00:34:58,539 --> 00:34:59,706
Yeah...

511
00:34:59,815 --> 00:35:01,442
Hey, where is Lord Kazekage?

512
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,148
He's fine. He's staying put.

513
00:35:10,528 --> 00:35:11,529
That's good.

514
00:35:11,684 --> 00:35:12,768
Yeah…

515
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,014
I can't even see an inch
in front of me!

516
00:35:42,337 --> 00:35:43,756
It's just a little sand!

517
00:35:44,464 --> 00:35:46,008
The central tower is
right up ahead.

518
00:35:46,288 --> 00:35:48,165
Let's overcome this
with gutsiness!

519
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,398
<i>Byakugan!</i>

520
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,902
This is going to take a lot more
than gutsiness to overcome...

521
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:59,197
Let's look for a spot nearby
to wait out the storm.

522
00:36:07,428 --> 00:36:09,430
I can't open my eyes!

523
00:36:10,249 --> 00:36:11,500
The sand stings!

524
00:36:14,132 --> 00:36:15,675
I-I can't breathe…

525
00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:20,430
I can't…hang on…

526
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,398
Use this.

527
00:36:32,852 --> 00:36:34,019
It's a sand mask!

528
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,070
The Second Exam is
temporarily postponed!

529
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,989
We'll take you to the shelter.

530
00:36:40,923 --> 00:36:43,551
Don't give in to
a sandstorm like this!

531
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,414
<i>Wind Scythe!</i>

532
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,084
All right, now's your chance
to move forward!

533
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,298
Come on, hurry!

534
00:37:04,273 --> 00:37:05,941
Are you okay, Lee?!

535
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:12,714
My Hidden Leaf cloak isn't much help
against a sandstorm this bad.

536
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,274
All right, then…

537
00:37:16,627 --> 00:37:18,712
<i>Eight Trigrams Palm: Rotation!</i>

538
00:37:20,115 --> 00:37:21,199
Now, Tenten!

539
00:37:21,701 --> 00:37:22,869
Leave it to me!

540
00:37:23,167 --> 00:37:25,795
I think I have something that
will help us block the sandstorm!

541
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:37,755
Let's go inside and
sit out this storm.

542
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:38,798
– Okay!
– Yes!

543
00:37:40,214 --> 00:37:42,737
I'm amazed you had
something like this handy.

544
00:37:43,289 --> 00:37:47,710
Situations like these are
the only times I'm useful.

545
00:37:47,972 --> 00:37:48,973
I see!

546
00:37:49,085 --> 00:37:50,086
As expected.

547
00:37:50,697 --> 00:37:52,699
At least one of you refute me!

548
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,140
I can't walk any further…

549
00:38:29,914 --> 00:38:32,959
Hang in there!
We're almost at the central tower!

550
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,062
Are you sure about that?

551
00:38:35,087 --> 00:38:37,423
You've been saying that,
but we haven't reached it yet…

552
00:38:37,821 --> 00:38:38,947
I'm sure!

553
00:38:41,774 --> 00:38:43,609
Look! The hidden quicksand!

554
00:38:43,777 --> 00:38:45,196
See, I was right!

555
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,409
This is not time to be saying that!

556
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:51,912
Mikoshi!

557
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:56,917
Hang on!

558
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,086
We're going to pull
Mikoshi out of there.

559
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,129
Okay!

560
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,561
I-I'm sinking!

561
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:30,993
<i>Pretty soon now…</i>

562
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:45,929
Almost there!

563
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,134
Now! Grab my hand!

564
00:40:05,609 --> 00:40:06,735
I can't stand this!

565
00:40:07,046 --> 00:40:09,111
We'd better make it to
the central tower fast

566
00:40:09,136 --> 00:40:10,387
or we'll be swallowed up.

567
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,439
Shibuki!

568
00:40:43,098 --> 00:40:46,393
It's okay!
I will always protect you.

569
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,981
Why?

570
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,875
Why did you protect me?

571
00:41:02,052 --> 00:41:04,554
Because you're precious to me.
Why else?

572
00:41:06,026 --> 00:41:09,196
That's why you have to protect
those who are dear to you too.

573
00:41:09,744 --> 00:41:12,997
If people bond with each other,
there wouldn't be wars in this world.

574
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:16,890
So first, make a hundred friends.

575
00:41:19,334 --> 00:41:20,418
What is it, Foo?

576
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:24,550
The central tower is that way!

577
00:41:29,729 --> 00:41:31,033
Hey, are you listening?

578
00:41:35,464 --> 00:41:36,715
Lord Shibuki will—!

579
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:38,679
For Lord Shibuki's sake—!

580
00:41:39,089 --> 00:41:43,593
I'm sure Shibuki will be pleased
with what I'm going to do now!

581
00:42:07,861 --> 00:42:09,946
All right! Stay still!

582
00:42:16,645 --> 00:42:17,980
Come on!

583
00:42:42,112 --> 00:42:45,782
I am Gaara, the Kazekage of
the Village Hidden in the Sand.

584
00:42:46,344 --> 00:42:47,971
I'm Foo from
the Hidden Waterfall Village.

585
00:42:50,103 --> 00:42:51,396
Why did you save them?

586
00:42:52,205 --> 00:42:54,666
You're taking the Chunin Exams too,
aren't you?

587
00:42:55,516 --> 00:42:59,312
Oh...Our village chief, Shibuki,
taught me.

588
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:05,391
<i>Shibuki?</i>

589
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:09,800
<i>Many people might
misunderstand you.</i>

590
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:14,953
<i>But you must hold
the people around you dear…</i>

591
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,886
<i>And do your best
for these people.</i>

592
00:43:19,031 --> 00:43:20,199
<i>If you do, then someday…</i>

593
00:43:20,371 --> 00:43:22,582
<i>I'll have a hundred friends, right?</i>

594
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:24,681
<i>Y-Yes…</i>

595
00:43:26,251 --> 00:43:30,004
He taught me that one day
I'm sure to have 100 friends.

596
00:43:30,783 --> 00:43:32,785
I see, that's why…

597
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:38,449
As I watched you,
I remembered a certain man…

598
00:43:39,044 --> 00:43:40,837
And now, I know why.

599
00:43:41,665 --> 00:43:44,126
Who is this man?

600
00:43:45,536 --> 00:43:47,496
He's a lot like you.

601
00:43:48,549 --> 00:43:50,384
I faced him in battle…

602
00:43:50,485 --> 00:43:52,070
And he taught me
that we can learn

603
00:43:52,118 --> 00:43:58,250
to understand the pain and sorrow,
and the joy of others.

604
00:43:58,563 --> 00:44:03,401
Wow...I'd like to meet someone
like that and become his friend.

605
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:15,653
Hey, what scroll do you guys have?

606
00:44:16,269 --> 00:44:17,854
The "Heaven" scroll…

607
00:44:20,721 --> 00:44:21,808
Take it!

608
00:44:22,367 --> 00:44:24,168
Really?!

609
00:44:24,488 --> 00:44:26,114
You're a lifesaver!

610
00:44:26,226 --> 00:44:27,227
We can't.

611
00:44:27,891 --> 00:44:29,476
We can't accept it.

612
00:44:30,484 --> 00:44:31,652
Why not?

613
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:35,496
I have a new goal,
so I don't need it!

614
00:44:35,717 --> 00:44:39,388
We were taught by Lord Gaara…

615
00:44:40,702 --> 00:44:44,123
To break down the barriers
that we create,

616
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:48,769
to overcome and win,
and grasp the results that we desire.

617
00:44:52,567 --> 00:44:56,071
We want that scroll
more than anything,

618
00:44:56,688 --> 00:44:58,064
but if we allow you
to give it to us…

619
00:44:58,089 --> 00:45:00,717
we can't claim that we fulfilled
the conditions of the Second Exam.

620
00:45:01,182 --> 00:45:04,644
We will obtain it through
our own power.

621
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:06,787
I understand!

622
00:45:07,774 --> 00:45:08,775
– Foo!
– Foo!

623
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:12,251
It'll be a pain if they catch me…

624
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,837
So, I'll be going now!

625
00:45:17,072 --> 00:45:18,340
Good bye!

626
00:45:18,825 --> 00:45:20,041
– Thank you!
– Thank you!

627
00:45:23,717 --> 00:45:25,302
<i>She's interesting…</i>

628
00:45:26,198 --> 00:45:29,326
<i>I'm sure we'll meet again somewhere.</i>

629
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,326
<i>Lord Gaara…</i>

630
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:47,828
<i>Prepare to die.</i>

631
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:59,423
So this is the legendary sandstorm
of the Land of Wind!

632
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,843
I'd heard rumors,
but this is mind-blowing!

633
00:46:03,117 --> 00:46:05,328
Postponing the Second Exam
was wise.

634
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:08,557
Yes, one careless move
and you're dead.

635
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:14,913
Are you from the Hidden Leaf?

636
00:46:15,879 --> 00:46:19,341
We have a letter from Lady Hokage
to Lord Kazekage.

637
00:46:19,844 --> 00:46:21,262
It's very urgent.

638
00:46:21,741 --> 00:46:23,159
We'll deliver it to him.

639
00:46:23,826 --> 00:46:27,455
Our instructions are
to deliver it to him in person.

640
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:29,369
Will you please let us through?

641
00:46:29,868 --> 00:46:30,869
No.

642
00:46:31,046 --> 00:46:33,799
The Second Exam is under
the Sand's jurisdiction.

643
00:46:34,351 --> 00:46:36,311
That's unfortunate.

644
00:46:36,336 --> 00:46:40,298
Well, since they won't let us through,
should we return to the Leaf Village?

645
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:42,549
Yeah, I guess we should.

646
00:46:43,087 --> 00:46:44,904
<i>That's really bad acting, you two.</i>

647
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,141
Well, so long!

648
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,226
What?!

649
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:53,936
Don't let them get away!

650
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:11,787
I can't take it anymore!

651
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:13,539
Hang in there!

652
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,791
Do you want to rot in the desert?!

653
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,584
But…

654
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,556
Don't get flustered!

655
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:39,439
I'm Kankuro,
a Hidden Sand proctor.

656
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:41,608
I'm going to get you out of here.

657
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:45,362
You came personally
to rescue us, Sir Kankuro?!

658
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:47,197
Follow me!

659
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:49,491
I'll take to you the shelter.

660
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:50,659
– Yes, sir!
– Yes, sir!

661
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:04,548
I can't walk…any further.

662
00:48:09,984 --> 00:48:11,236
Listen to me!

663
00:48:11,261 --> 00:48:13,847
Think of this as part of
the Second Exam and get through it!

664
00:48:14,449 --> 00:48:15,909
Lady Proctor!

665
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:19,605
If you end up whining
over a mere sandstorm,

666
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:22,733
you'll never make it
as a Sand chunin!

667
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:32,618
Talk about exceeding
one's expectations…

668
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:36,038
I've never seen
a sandstorm this massive.

669
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:38,081
I can barely breathe…

670
00:48:38,397 --> 00:48:41,274
Leave it to me! I'll stop it.

671
00:48:41,899 --> 00:48:45,547
<i>Third Gate, Gate of Life…Open!</i>

672
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:50,135
All right, follow me!

673
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:52,846
Okay, let's go.

674
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:53,889
Yes.

675
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:08,987
Hey, stop moving around!

676
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:12,950
Sorry! But staying still is so stifling…

677
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,858
Instead of getting buried
by the sand like this,

678
00:49:15,883 --> 00:49:17,552
maybe we should make
a run for it…

679
00:49:17,749 --> 00:49:18,750
Wait…

680
00:49:20,822 --> 00:49:21,545
<i>Byakugan!</i>

681
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:33,637
I broke through!

682
00:49:35,561 --> 00:49:38,272
The sandstorm should subside
in about an hour.

683
00:49:39,233 --> 00:49:40,485
That's when we'll move.

684
00:49:42,749 --> 00:49:44,167
I understand.

685
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:46,250
We just have to endure
a little bit more.

686
00:50:02,772 --> 00:50:05,483
I have a report on the situation
for Lord Kazekage.

687
00:50:06,027 --> 00:50:07,403
You may enter.

688
00:50:11,276 --> 00:50:12,318
Excuse me, my lord.

689
00:50:18,867 --> 00:50:22,245
We've received status reports
on the sandstorm from the teams.

690
00:50:22,706 --> 00:50:27,253
Nearly all exam participants have
been evacuated to the shelter.

691
00:50:32,025 --> 00:50:33,234
Lord Kazekage?

692
00:50:34,202 --> 00:50:35,287
<i>What is this?!</i>

693
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:37,131
<i>What's wrong?!</i>

694
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:42,864
Are you men blind?!

695
00:50:50,066 --> 00:50:51,443
A-A Sand Clone!

696
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:55,743
Where is Lord Kazekage?!

697
00:51:11,237 --> 00:51:12,822
Thank you very much!

698
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:14,533
If you thank anyone,

699
00:51:14,558 --> 00:51:16,310
it should be Foo of
the Hidden Waterfall…

700
00:51:16,427 --> 00:51:17,803
– Y-Yes!
– Y-Yes!

701
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:18,700
Now go!

702
00:51:18,725 --> 00:51:21,269
The Second Exam will
probably resume shortly.

703
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:22,412
Y-Yes!

704
00:51:41,247 --> 00:51:42,456
What?!

705
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:44,768
An enemy?!

706
00:51:45,537 --> 00:51:47,288
Where's it coming from…?

707
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:50,649
We chose the wrong route.

708
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:53,367
We can't see what's happening
on higher ground from here.

709
00:51:55,051 --> 00:51:58,471
That sound gives me the creeps.

710
00:51:59,023 --> 00:52:01,359
We should high tail it out of here.

711
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:04,454
Yeah, but let's proceed
with caution.

712
00:52:13,659 --> 00:52:15,620
<i>Power of Dharma: Silhouette.</i>

713
00:52:18,361 --> 00:52:20,780
The tempo's changed.
Let's hurry.

714
00:52:21,424 --> 00:52:22,425
Yes.

715
00:52:29,245 --> 00:52:30,371
What is this?

716
00:52:30,396 --> 00:52:31,981
Huh?! The shadows…!

717
00:52:33,394 --> 00:52:34,729
What are these things?

718
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:57,424
<i>Sand Clone!</i>

719
00:53:16,072 --> 00:53:18,074
Lord Gaara, what's going on?!

720
00:53:18,456 --> 00:53:20,500
Their target is me.

721
00:53:20,726 --> 00:53:23,228
There's no need for you
to get involved.

722
00:53:23,772 --> 00:53:28,462
It's our duty as Sand shinobi to fight
when our Kazekage is threatened!

723
00:53:29,221 --> 00:53:31,390
Return to the Second Exam.

724
00:53:31,916 --> 00:53:34,752
That is your duty as Sand shinobi!

725
00:53:41,488 --> 00:53:43,406
<i>Dharma Sealing Jutsu:</i>

726
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,723
<i>Sen no Rikyu!</i>

727
00:53:58,818 --> 00:53:59,861
Get down!

728
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:22,550
<i>I'm losing…my power…</i>

729
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:32,560
The chain!

730
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:35,355
Let's pull out the chain!

731
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,731
– R-Right!
– R-Right!

732
00:54:40,431 --> 00:54:42,600
Go! I can do this alone…

733
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:43,488
But…

734
00:54:43,513 --> 00:54:48,309
I order you as the Kazekage
to withdraw immediately!

735
00:54:48,444 --> 00:54:51,114
And not a word of this
to anyone, understood?

736
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,635
W-What'll we do?

737
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:08,179
How should I know?!

738
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:11,641
Let's go to the central tower
and get help!

739
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:14,686
But…Lord Kazekage swore us
to secrecy!

740
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:17,480
You fool! His life is in danger!

741
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,529
<i>Resistance is useless.</i>

742
00:55:24,808 --> 00:55:27,936
<i>This is the sealing jutsu passed on
to me by Priest Bunpuku!</i>

743
00:55:27,961 --> 00:55:31,715
<i>Now, I can extract Shukaku
from Gaara.</i>

744
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:50,685
Yukata! Are you all right?

745
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:54,726
I-I…can't move anymore.

746
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:57,687
Matsuri! Yukata can't go on!

747
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:58,813
What do we do?

748
00:55:58,813 --> 00:56:01,441
Mikoshi, take care of Yukata!

749
00:56:01,878 --> 00:56:05,508
I'm going to inform headquarters
about Lord Gaara!

750
00:56:05,533 --> 00:56:06,617
But, by yourself?!

751
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:09,032
Watch Yukata! I'm going!

752
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,826
Matsuri…

753
00:56:21,954 --> 00:56:25,791
I wonder if I'm going to make
a hundred friends...?

754
00:56:31,382 --> 00:56:33,509
She is so impulsive!

755
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:36,726
She's abandoning the Chunin Exams?
What is she up to?!

756
00:57:12,238 --> 00:57:13,220
Foo…

757
00:57:13,245 --> 00:57:14,705
We finally caught up…

758
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:19,121
Where are you going, Foo?!

759
00:57:19,365 --> 00:57:21,057
Are you going back
for the Second Exam?

760
00:57:23,458 --> 00:57:25,793
I just can't figure her out!

761
00:57:26,926 --> 00:57:28,261
– Hey!
– Wait!

762
00:57:29,138 --> 00:57:32,516
The friend I just made
is in trouble!

763
00:57:33,397 --> 00:57:34,481
Friend?

764
00:57:34,537 --> 00:57:37,123
Don't tell me
you're going to help?!

765
00:57:37,368 --> 00:57:38,697
Of course!

766
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:43,899
Come back, Foo!

767
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,146
Damn it!

768
00:57:45,171 --> 00:57:47,215
Never mind
the Second Exam already!

769
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:49,492
We just have to
get her back safely!

770
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:54,554
Y-Yeah…

771
00:58:03,873 --> 00:58:05,792
Hey! Let us pass!

772
00:58:06,167 --> 00:58:09,003
We have a letter for Lord Kazekage
from Lady Hokage!

773
00:58:09,331 --> 00:58:10,373
We'll take it!

774
00:58:10,398 --> 00:58:12,066
That won't do!

775
00:58:12,158 --> 00:58:14,535
We must deliver it
directly to Lord Kazekage.

776
00:58:14,615 --> 00:58:16,701
I explained that's not possible!

777
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:17,894
He's not here!

778
00:58:19,656 --> 00:58:20,657
Not here either!

779
00:58:23,378 --> 00:58:24,755
Something's up.

780
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:27,746
Yeah...The Kazekage isn't here.

781
00:58:27,893 --> 00:58:31,655
What in the world?!
The Kazekage...?

782
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:51,152
This chain…

783
00:58:52,168 --> 00:58:54,754
is extracting my chakra…

784
00:59:27,841 --> 00:59:28,842
<i>That's...!</i>

785
00:59:29,254 --> 00:59:31,840
<i>There's no mistake.
That's Tailed Beast chakra!</i>

786
00:59:32,369 --> 00:59:35,539
<i>If left alone, his Tailed Beast
will be extracted…and he'll die!</i>

787
00:59:37,039 --> 00:59:38,123
<i>Foo!</i>

788
00:59:38,592 --> 00:59:41,470
Stay away!
This has nothing to do with you.

789
00:59:41,868 --> 00:59:43,995
It does have something
to do with me!

790
00:59:46,135 --> 00:59:48,429
You know about me…don't you?

791
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:51,504
Yes. You're a Jinchuriki too.

792
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:54,966
That's why I can
feel your pain too.

793
00:59:55,022 --> 00:59:58,984
And you taught me that friends
understand each other's pain.

794
01:00:00,475 --> 01:00:01,976
Stop it…!

795
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:13,985
It's sucking out my power…

796
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:17,838
Are you all right?!

797
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:20,980
<i>So there's another one…</i>

798
01:00:21,467 --> 01:00:22,760
<i>How interesting…</i>

799
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:27,665
<i>Not even Lord Bunpuku ever
sealed two Tailed Beasts at once.</i>

800
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:32,295
<i>This is the perfect opportunity to test
the power of the Dharma Seal.</i>

801
01:00:41,226 --> 01:00:42,685
Foo! Be careful!

802
01:01:06,649 --> 01:01:07,650
Foo!

803
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:09,666
I-I'm sorry…

804
01:01:09,949 --> 01:01:12,743
I think I failed…

805
01:01:13,765 --> 01:01:16,810
<i>Dharma Sealing Jutsu:
Sen no Rikyu!</i>

806
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:39,979
If the sandstorm continued
any longer,

807
01:01:40,093 --> 01:01:42,763
this would have
become our grave.

808
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:44,923
You never know
what will happen next.

809
01:01:44,948 --> 01:01:46,244
That's the Demon Desert!

810
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:48,730
Let's get this Second Exam
over with.

811
01:01:49,008 --> 01:01:53,012
Right! The central tower
isn't far from here.

812
01:01:53,247 --> 01:01:55,040
All right! Let's go!

813
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:58,513
What's the matter?

814
01:01:58,538 --> 01:02:00,123
Did you forget something?

815
01:02:00,606 --> 01:02:01,440
Yeah…

816
01:02:01,667 --> 01:02:05,212
There's something we need to do
before we head for the central tower.

817
01:02:05,503 --> 01:02:06,838
Yes.

818
01:02:07,025 --> 01:02:09,653
There's someone I want
to settle things with too.

819
01:02:09,769 --> 01:02:11,562
Do you have someone
like that too?

820
01:02:12,352 --> 01:02:14,604
No, it's nothing like that.

821
01:02:18,883 --> 01:02:20,593
Is there something
the matter with them?

822
01:02:20,921 --> 01:02:23,090
We have two scrolls.

823
01:02:25,489 --> 01:02:26,699
Actually…

824
01:02:32,965 --> 01:02:35,092
– What?!
– What?!

825
01:02:35,117 --> 01:02:36,994
They're both "Heaven" scrolls.

826
01:02:37,047 --> 01:02:38,507
How could you?!

827
01:02:38,532 --> 01:02:41,660
Why did you keep something
so important a secret?!

828
01:02:42,441 --> 01:02:44,693
I didn't intend to
keep it a secret.

829
01:02:45,362 --> 01:02:48,532
It's just that things happened and
I didn't have a chance to tell you.

830
01:02:48,908 --> 01:02:51,744
That's a really bad excuse…

831
01:02:52,494 --> 01:02:57,165
Well, we'll just have to recoup
and obtain an "Earth" scroll somehow.

832
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:06,282
<i>Byakugan!</i>

833
01:03:20,356 --> 01:03:21,523
Over that way!

834
01:03:21,712 --> 01:03:23,172
Please wait!

835
01:03:23,534 --> 01:03:24,994
Oh, come on!

836
01:03:35,831 --> 01:03:39,084
H-Hey! You're going to take
a scroll from someone

837
01:03:39,109 --> 01:03:41,364
who's ready to drop
from exhaustion?!

838
01:03:41,507 --> 01:03:44,427
We can't do something
so cowardly!

839
01:03:44,685 --> 01:03:46,270
Don't jump to conclusions!

840
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:48,616
We can't ignore someone
in distress.

841
01:03:48,819 --> 01:03:49,737
That's right!

842
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:53,287
Neji would never stoop
to such a dirty trick.

843
01:03:54,555 --> 01:03:57,558
Of course not! The thought
never crossed my mind…

844
01:04:02,122 --> 01:04:04,249
Did something happen?

845
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:06,667
It's Lord Kazekage!

846
01:04:07,122 --> 01:04:10,501
Someone is attacking Lord Gaara!

847
01:04:11,243 --> 01:04:12,411
Gaara?!

848
01:04:50,054 --> 01:04:51,430
<i>Just a little longer.</i>

849
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:58,227
I'll give this to you,
so please, help me!

850
01:04:59,441 --> 01:05:00,639
Don't worry about that!

851
01:05:00,963 --> 01:05:02,839
Can you just show us the way?

852
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:06,360
Yes!

853
01:05:16,681 --> 01:05:17,682
Over there.

854
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:19,165
<i>Byakugan!</i>

855
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:33,429
Found them!

856
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:43,606
What are you planning to do?!

857
01:05:43,814 --> 01:05:44,899
We can't ignore them.

858
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:48,611
But that could mean defaulting
on the Chunin Exams.

859
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,488
I-I'm sorry.

860
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:55,117
It's not your fault.
It's my decision to take action.

861
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:56,160
R-Right.

862
01:05:57,304 --> 01:05:58,806
You're right, Tenten.

863
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:02,166
This could mean a default
on the Chunin Exams.

864
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:05,586
But in a situation like this,
he wouldn't…

865
01:06:08,589 --> 01:06:10,800
Naruto wouldn't hesitate
for a moment to act.

866
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:12,551
Yes, I'm sure he wouldn't.

867
01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:13,552
You're right!

868
01:06:13,552 --> 01:06:17,431
Naruto would scold us if
we ignored someone in need

869
01:06:17,456 --> 01:06:20,000
in order to pass
the Second Exam.

870
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:23,437
Naruto and Gaara both
challenged their destinies

871
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,106
and overcame hardship.

872
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:28,651
They wouldn't turn their backs and
say it's someone else's problem.

873
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:44,375
Damn it...I told you not to come.

874
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,669
How can I stay away?!

875
01:06:46,919 --> 01:06:51,298
If your friend was here,
I'm sure he'd come to save you.

876
01:06:51,918 --> 01:06:53,128
Friend?!

877
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:59,473
Yeah, that's because he's a fool…

878
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:32,131
<i>Ninja Art: Cocoon…</i>

879
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:53,319
<i>What is that?</i>

880
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:02,495
This is…?

881
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:07,792
My power. But it isn't enough
to break this chakra chain.

882
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:15,174
So, I'm going to try
to buy us some time.

883
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:29,522
<i>This is…!</i>

884
01:08:30,578 --> 01:08:33,498
<i>The flow in the chakra chain
is becoming sluggish…</i>

885
01:08:34,629 --> 01:08:39,092
<i>That cocoon has the power to suppress
the absorption of chakra?</i>

886
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:47,581
What did you do?

887
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:49,875
I made a cocoon with
my chakra threads.

888
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:53,754
My cocoon is
a complicated tangle of

889
01:08:53,779 --> 01:08:55,489
super-fine chakra threads.

890
01:08:55,947 --> 01:08:58,825
And it weakened its absorption,
just as I thought.

891
01:08:59,523 --> 01:09:01,150
It didn't stop it.

892
01:09:01,595 --> 01:09:04,598
The rate of chakra being sucked out
has definitely slowed down,

893
01:09:04,623 --> 01:09:06,083
and lessened the pain…

894
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:09,019
But eventually, our Tailed Beasts
will be extracted…

895
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:10,771
and we'll die.

896
01:09:11,663 --> 01:09:13,582
Negative thoughts aren't good.

897
01:09:13,607 --> 01:09:16,485
I'm sure someone will come
to save us!

898
01:09:16,888 --> 01:09:20,308
How can you be so positive?

899
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:24,660
Someone once praised me
that I was born special.

900
01:09:25,536 --> 01:09:27,538
No one will come to help us.

901
01:09:27,775 --> 01:09:29,652
Don't say such things!

902
01:09:29,677 --> 01:09:32,889
Hey! Is someone out there?!

903
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:37,339
Your voice won't travel
through this cocoon.

904
01:09:37,381 --> 01:09:39,800
Oops! Darn it.

905
01:09:41,343 --> 01:09:42,553
All right then…

906
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:44,555
I'll just pull this out
with brute strength.

907
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:54,356
We'll have to wait
to be rescued, after all.

908
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:58,360
No matter how long we wait, no
one from the Sand will come to our aid.

909
01:09:58,694 --> 01:10:01,572
Again with those negative thoughts!

910
01:10:01,906 --> 01:10:04,074
Would you still say that
if you knew

911
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:06,619
the person attacking us
is from the Sand?

912
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:07,953
Are you serious?!

913
01:10:16,927 --> 01:10:18,136
<i>How futile.</i>

914
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:21,383
<i>All you did was throw away
any way of escape.</i>

915
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:25,054
<i>Just how long do you think
you'll last in there?</i>

916
01:10:32,019 --> 01:10:35,439
In the past, the only way
I could relate to others

917
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:38,192
was with hate and a desire to kill.

918
01:10:42,154 --> 01:10:44,531
Now that I am the Kazekage,

919
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:47,493
some believe that
I will rule through fear,

920
01:10:47,534 --> 01:10:50,246
and are trying to eliminate me.

921
01:10:50,454 --> 01:10:52,623
That can't be helped.

922
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:57,628
I'm the one who brought it on.

923
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:04,134
If I have any regrets,
it's only that I wish people knew

924
01:11:04,176 --> 01:11:06,470
how much I was trying to change.

925
01:11:07,404 --> 01:11:08,697
That friend of yours
taught you, right?

926
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:11,365
That you can share and
understand the pain,

927
01:11:11,602 --> 01:11:14,313
suffering and happiness of others!

928
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:23,696
Yes, that's right.

929
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:28,033
But it's difficult for a Jinchuriki.

930
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,869
That's not true!
I'm sure it'll all work out.

931
01:11:31,464 --> 01:11:35,051
Even a Jinchuriki can make
a hundred friends.

932
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:37,501
I just know it!
The Village Chief told me so.

933
01:11:38,908 --> 01:11:40,618
<i>They're alike, after all.</i>

934
01:11:43,701 --> 01:11:45,369
The sound of a lute?!

935
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:10,050
What is that?!

936
01:12:10,115 --> 01:12:12,242
It looks like a giant cocoon!

937
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:14,955
And who is that man?

938
01:12:19,328 --> 01:12:21,830
You're exam participants
from the Hidden Waterfall!

939
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:23,297
Yes…

940
01:12:23,579 --> 01:12:25,581
We're looking for Foo.
She wandered off.

941
01:12:25,883 --> 01:12:27,259
Foo wandered off?

942
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,333
<i>What?!</i>

943
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:45,235
<i>Chakra is being extracted
from Gaara and Foo.</i>

944
01:12:45,951 --> 01:12:47,494
What's wrong, Neji?!

945
01:12:47,571 --> 01:12:49,573
What is in that cocoon?!

946
01:12:51,582 --> 01:12:53,042
It's your teammate.

947
01:12:58,501 --> 01:13:02,005
Are you fine with this happening?
At this rate, they'll both die.

948
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:05,172
If we act now, we can save them…

949
01:13:13,649 --> 01:13:14,448
Please…

950
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:16,100
Save Foo.

951
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:18,811
All right.

952
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:30,739
From what I gather,
the priest's back is vulnerable.

953
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:33,920
This is what I've come up with.

954
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:38,664
We'll divide into two teams…
An attack and a rescue team.

955
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:44,628
The attack team will sneak in close
and attack from behind…

956
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:47,673
The rescue team will seize
the opportunity and rescue the two.

957
01:13:48,882 --> 01:13:51,051
Lee, Matsuri and the two
from the Hidden Waterfall

958
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:52,553
will attack the lute-playing priest!

959
01:13:52,727 --> 01:13:53,853
– Understood.
– Understood.

960
01:13:53,951 --> 01:13:56,037
Right! We'll pulverize him!

961
01:13:56,286 --> 01:13:57,913
I'd like to be on the rescue team!

962
01:13:58,183 --> 01:14:01,103
No, I need Tenten for the rescue.

963
01:14:01,388 --> 01:14:02,472
The two of us will go.

964
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:03,772
Okay!

965
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:05,274
Scatter!

966
01:14:11,594 --> 01:14:13,596
<i>Shuriken Shadow Clone!</i>

967
01:14:14,516 --> 01:14:16,226
<i>Water Style: Water Shuriken!</i>

968
01:14:16,653 --> 01:14:18,446
<i>Deadly Shell Meteorite!</i>

969
01:14:19,477 --> 01:14:21,187
<i>Leaf Hurricane!</i>

970
01:14:24,751 --> 01:14:26,753
<i>Dharma Barrier:
Celestial Pillars!</i>

971
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:32,968
What is that?!

972
01:14:33,051 --> 01:14:34,303
Some defensive jutsu?!

973
01:14:34,736 --> 01:14:36,655
No, that's not the only thing.

974
01:14:37,222 --> 01:14:38,348
Let's use caution!

975
01:15:00,535 --> 01:15:02,537
Tenten, I need a chakra sword.

976
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:03,665
Got it!

977
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:17,679
<i>Aim for a section of the cocoon!</i>

978
01:15:27,868 --> 01:15:28,869
Right here!

979
01:15:42,947 --> 01:15:44,908
Damn it! We can't get close to him!

980
01:15:45,363 --> 01:15:46,698
It's an impregnable barrier!

981
01:15:47,504 --> 01:15:51,533
At this rate, we're not helping
Lord Kazekage at all.

982
01:15:51,822 --> 01:15:53,449
No, this is sufficient.

983
01:15:53,562 --> 01:15:54,340
What?

984
01:15:55,592 --> 01:15:58,971
Just drawing his attention away
will make Neji's job easier.

985
01:15:59,012 --> 01:16:00,669
That is what we are here to do.

986
01:16:01,396 --> 01:16:02,688
Neji, are you all right?!

987
01:16:06,407 --> 01:16:07,638
Are you two okay?

988
01:16:08,384 --> 01:16:09,139
See!

989
01:16:09,164 --> 01:16:10,874
Someone came to help, after all!

990
01:16:11,723 --> 01:16:14,184
I gave strict orders
not to tell anyone…

991
01:16:14,695 --> 01:16:16,238
Don't be angry with
your subordinates.

992
01:16:16,609 --> 01:16:19,028
They were worried sick about you.

993
01:16:23,870 --> 01:16:24,913
I figured as much…

994
01:16:25,528 --> 01:16:28,323
This chain has penetrated
your chakra points.

995
01:16:29,052 --> 01:16:31,721
And they are causing direct damage
to the chakra network.

996
01:16:32,571 --> 01:16:35,757
They're controlling the flow of
chakra through the chakra points and

997
01:16:35,799 --> 01:16:38,677
siphoning away
your Tailed Beast chakra.

998
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:40,137
Yeah…

999
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:42,764
Eventually, the Tailed Beast chakra
will be weakened enough

1000
01:16:42,789 --> 01:16:45,417
and he'll extract the Beast itself.

1001
01:16:45,758 --> 01:16:47,427
Can you please help?

1002
01:16:47,885 --> 01:16:50,721
Tailed Beast or whatever,
chakra is chakra.

1003
01:16:51,693 --> 01:16:55,597
If we plug the chakra point that's being
used to siphon the Tailed Beast chakra,

1004
01:16:55,622 --> 01:16:58,014
we may be able to stop the flow.

1005
01:16:58,777 --> 01:16:59,778
Is that possible?

1006
01:17:00,371 --> 01:17:03,853
Yeah...It'll be tricky,
but it's worth a try.

1007
01:17:04,936 --> 01:17:05,760
Please do.

1008
01:17:11,418 --> 01:17:12,419
Here it is!

1009
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:14,379
<i>Gentle Fist: Chakra Point Needle!</i>

1010
01:17:20,677 --> 01:17:21,678
What happened?

1011
01:17:24,097 --> 01:17:27,517
The Tailed Beast chakra is
so powerful that it repelled me.

1012
01:17:28,685 --> 01:17:32,356
I didn't think it would
be this strong!

1013
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:35,817
<i>So I guess Gaara and
Foo's Tailed Beast chakra</i>

1014
01:17:35,859 --> 01:17:40,113
<i>are just as powerful as Naruto's.</i>

1015
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:44,034
Please don't give up!
We're counting on you!

1016
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:47,635
Yeah, I know. I'll try again!

1017
01:18:06,357 --> 01:18:07,817
All right, the flow stopped!

1018
01:18:09,601 --> 01:18:11,603
You're next, Foo!

1019
01:18:11,603 --> 01:18:12,604
Okay!

1020
01:18:25,376 --> 01:18:26,103
<i>What?!</i>

1021
01:18:27,039 --> 01:18:29,207
<i>The chakra flow has stopped?!</i>

1022
01:18:30,345 --> 01:18:31,346
<i>Why?!</i>

1023
01:18:31,581 --> 01:18:34,000
<i>Why isn't the Tailed Beast
chakra flowing in?!</i>

1024
01:18:34,233 --> 01:18:35,901
The lute-playing priest
is acting strange…

1025
01:18:36,139 --> 01:18:38,600
Yes, something must
have happened.

1026
01:18:39,082 --> 01:18:41,584
Did the Leaf's Byakugan user
do something?

1027
01:18:42,191 --> 01:18:45,444
Well, the enemy definitely
looks flustered.

1028
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:07,284
What's happening?

1029
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:09,453
It looks like it's alive!

1030
01:19:09,494 --> 01:19:10,412
That's creepy!

1031
01:19:10,437 --> 01:19:11,646
Be careful!

1032
01:19:13,988 --> 01:19:15,448
<i>Unless I do something,</i>

1033
01:19:15,504 --> 01:19:19,091
<i>the chain will continue searching
for Tailed Beast chakra!</i>

1034
01:19:19,252 --> 01:19:22,464
<i>It will find the chakra that
it has already stored up in me…</i>

1035
01:19:22,938 --> 01:19:25,357
<i>and start siphoning
that Tailed Beast chakra…</i>

1036
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:27,262
<i>until it destroys itself.</i>

1037
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:50,827
The barrier's been broken!

1038
01:20:03,924 --> 01:20:06,802
May I ask you to spare him?

1039
01:20:07,387 --> 01:20:09,139
Yes, I understand.

1040
01:20:15,769 --> 01:20:16,770
Neji…

1041
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:20,148
I see…

1042
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:22,322
It's the same theory as earlier.

1043
01:20:23,184 --> 01:20:24,477
The chakra points are closed.

1044
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:28,198
There are more chakra points
here though…

1045
01:20:29,466 --> 01:20:31,427
Everyone, please stand back!

1046
01:20:50,136 --> 01:20:51,137
We can still save him.

1047
01:20:52,097 --> 01:20:53,473
Let's take him to the Medical Team.

1048
01:20:53,807 --> 01:20:55,308
Yes, understood!

1049
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:02,481
You have my thanks, Neji.

1050
01:21:02,506 --> 01:21:04,634
Imagine, being rescued by you.

1051
01:21:06,444 --> 01:21:07,904
Is everyone all right?!

1052
01:21:08,511 --> 01:21:10,596
Yes, we're okay now.

1053
01:21:12,670 --> 01:21:13,671
Lord Gaara!

1054
01:21:14,369 --> 01:21:15,704
Thank goodness you're safe!

1055
01:21:17,267 --> 01:21:19,436
Matsuri performed admirably too.

1056
01:21:26,762 --> 01:21:27,763
Over there!

1057
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:32,095
It seems like they don't need
our help, after all!

1058
01:21:32,295 --> 01:21:35,173
Yes, I guess we were
a little too late.

1059
01:21:36,507 --> 01:21:38,217
I'm Foo of the Hidden Waterfall!

1060
01:21:38,685 --> 01:21:41,438
I'm trying to make
one hundred friends!

1061
01:21:42,051 --> 01:21:44,887
So please, be Foo's friend!

1062
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:46,943
O-Okay, okay!

1063
01:21:47,438 --> 01:21:49,399
I get it, just let go of my hand.

1064
01:21:51,234 --> 01:21:52,861
Neji! You're so lucky!

1065
01:21:52,886 --> 01:21:54,888
Woohoo! Woohoo!

1066
01:21:54,993 --> 01:21:57,454
Friends! Friends!

1067
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:02,375
He's not on the north route.

1068
01:22:03,084 --> 01:22:05,086
He isn't on the south or
west routes either!

1069
01:22:05,493 --> 01:22:07,328
Where could Lord Gaara
have gone?

1070
01:22:09,716 --> 01:22:11,927
The massive sandstorm
seems to have passed.

1071
01:22:12,097 --> 01:22:13,056
Lord Gaara?!

1072
01:22:13,947 --> 01:22:15,490
What's the big commotion?

1073
01:22:16,170 --> 01:22:18,795
Stop making a fuss and
resume the Second Exam.

1074
01:22:19,559 --> 01:22:20,602
Yes, sir!

1075
01:22:21,146 --> 01:22:23,273
Hurry! Prepare to resume
the Second Exam!

1076
01:22:35,909 --> 01:22:38,828
<i>It's unusual for Houichi
not to send a message.</i>

1077
01:22:39,501 --> 01:22:40,688
<i>Did he fail?</i>

1078
01:22:55,845 --> 01:22:56,846
Lord Gaara!

1079
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:02,978
Fugi…

1080
01:23:03,294 --> 01:23:05,462
I've wanted to have
an in-depth discussion with you.

1081
01:23:09,442 --> 01:23:10,485
Well then…

1082
01:23:11,085 --> 01:23:12,587
What did you want to talk about?

1083
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:19,119
I've always thought of you as
a valuable citizen of the Hidden Sand.

1084
01:23:20,495 --> 01:23:22,372
Of course, I still do.

1085
01:23:22,872 --> 01:23:24,124
I am humbled.

1086
01:23:25,175 --> 01:23:29,346
In the past, words like "citizen"
and "friend" were just that…

1087
01:23:29,587 --> 01:23:33,018
Mere words that held
no meaning to me.

1088
01:23:33,883 --> 01:23:37,846
For a long time after I was born,
even though I recognized these words,

1089
01:23:37,887 --> 01:23:40,390
they were not part
of my existence.

1090
01:23:40,734 --> 01:23:45,489
Oh. And when did these concepts
become real to you?

1091
01:23:46,422 --> 01:23:48,139
When I infiltrated
the Hidden Leaf Village

1092
01:23:48,164 --> 01:23:49,624
with the intent to destroy it.

1093
01:23:49,733 --> 01:23:52,527
There, for the first time,
I met someone I could call a friend.

1094
01:23:53,711 --> 01:23:57,882
Ironically, he was an enemy
who belonged to the Hidden Leaf.

1095
01:24:03,474 --> 01:24:06,519
Although he and I
shared similar circumstances,

1096
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:13,465
he empathized with the pain of others,
and shared in their joy and tears…

1097
01:24:13,755 --> 01:24:16,466
Meeting him made me realize…

1098
01:24:17,813 --> 01:24:22,360
how precious and important
the word "friend" is.

1099
01:24:23,431 --> 01:24:26,184
And it made me want
to become like him…

1100
01:24:26,209 --> 01:24:29,338
a human being who is valued
and needed by others.

1101
01:24:31,973 --> 01:24:35,351
Lord Gaara, you are and
will always be,

1102
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:38,782
a person who is essential
to the Hidden Sand.

1103
01:24:39,819 --> 01:24:43,865
All this time, I've been considered
a military weapon to be feared.

1104
01:24:45,029 --> 01:24:49,825
And that continues to instill fear even
in the hearts of the Hidden Sand.

1105
01:24:49,941 --> 01:24:51,067
But that's—!

1106
01:24:51,586 --> 01:24:52,879
I know.

1107
01:24:53,588 --> 01:24:55,137
If this were not so,

1108
01:24:55,162 --> 01:24:59,083
my own father would not
have tried to kill me six times.

1109
01:25:01,063 --> 01:25:07,278
I am aware of the deeply rooted opposition
to my tenure as the Kazekage.

1110
01:25:08,061 --> 01:25:11,564
Should I accept position
or should I turn it down?

1111
01:25:11,606 --> 01:25:13,441
It was a dilemma for me.

1112
01:25:13,441 --> 01:25:16,903
But after my friend, the Leaf shinobi,
taught me about friendship,

1113
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:18,822
I thought it over and decided…

1114
01:25:19,172 --> 01:25:22,550
that I wanted to heal the pain
I had caused everyone.

1115
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:26,663
But it's been difficult to
get the people of the Sand

1116
01:25:26,704 --> 01:25:28,706
to believe that I am sincere.

1117
01:25:28,832 --> 01:25:34,654
There was a time I felt the wounds that I
inflicted on my people would never heal.

1118
01:25:35,181 --> 01:25:39,351
I thought I should just disappear
from the Sand Village,

1119
01:25:39,376 --> 01:25:41,378
then the fear would
finally disappear too.

1120
01:25:43,221 --> 01:25:47,016
But I found there were people who,
without any prejudice,

1121
01:25:47,058 --> 01:25:50,103
accepted my feelings.

1122
01:25:56,284 --> 01:25:59,120
<i>You are frightened of yourself.</i>

1123
01:26:00,196 --> 01:26:02,031
<i>When you handle a weapon,</i>

1124
01:26:02,073 --> 01:26:04,534
<i>you must suppress your feelings
and become emotionless.</i>

1125
01:26:04,742 --> 01:26:05,910
<i>Y-Yes, sir!</i>

1126
01:26:07,787 --> 01:26:13,459
<i>I once met someone just like you
in Hidden Leaf Village.</i>

1127
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:18,548
<i>Through sheer perseverance,
he has become a fine shinobi.</i>

1128
01:26:19,382 --> 01:26:24,345
<i>Shira, I predict you will be
as good a shinobi as him.</i>

1129
01:26:25,722 --> 01:26:31,561
These shinobi have to come to accept
and rely on my guidance,

1130
01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:33,688
and are maturing steadily.

1131
01:26:35,139 --> 01:26:36,265
We're almost there.

1132
01:26:37,128 --> 01:26:39,422
But we still need one more scroll.

1133
01:26:39,866 --> 01:26:42,035
Well, a lot of things happened.

1134
01:26:42,322 --> 01:26:46,367
Let's forget about passing
the Chunin Exams until the next time.

1135
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:51,664
In that case, I don't know
if we'll get a scroll,

1136
01:26:52,277 --> 01:26:54,545
but there's someone
I want to fight just once.

1137
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:59,505
That person received guidance
from Lord Gaara

1138
01:26:59,547 --> 01:27:01,466
and developed into a shinobi,
just like me.

1139
01:27:02,592 --> 01:27:05,127
There's something
I want to confirm

1140
01:27:05,152 --> 01:27:07,529
by fighting someone who received
the same teachings as me...

1141
01:27:12,810 --> 01:27:14,437
We did it!

1142
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:15,855
We made it! We made it!

1143
01:27:16,147 --> 01:27:19,692
But we still only have
the "Heaven" scroll…

1144
01:27:20,149 --> 01:27:21,359
It can't be helped.

1145
01:27:21,527 --> 01:27:23,863
We're physically at
the end of our limits!

1146
01:27:24,021 --> 01:27:26,357
If I hadn't stopped along
the way for a personal battle…

1147
01:27:26,472 --> 01:27:28,034
Don't say that!

1148
01:27:28,059 --> 01:27:30,687
That's right.
This is all we can do right now.

1149
01:27:30,828 --> 01:27:32,664
I'm sure we'll get
another crack at it.

1150
01:27:33,052 --> 01:27:34,095
Thank you!

1151
01:27:43,049 --> 01:27:44,133
What is it?

1152
01:27:44,342 --> 01:27:47,053
Shira, please fight me.

1153
01:27:47,468 --> 01:27:50,387
If I lose, you can have this.

1154
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:56,729
It's senseless for Sand
to fight Sand.

1155
01:27:57,230 --> 01:27:59,274
We've already made a decision.

1156
01:28:00,416 --> 01:28:01,292
Hey!

1157
01:28:01,591 --> 01:28:03,670
This is useless to us!

1158
01:28:03,695 --> 01:28:04,696
Take it!

1159
01:28:05,488 --> 01:28:07,865
Really? You're a lifesaver!

1160
01:28:07,949 --> 01:28:09,325
We can't accept it.

1161
01:28:09,670 --> 01:28:10,880
What?

1162
01:28:15,194 --> 01:28:18,012
Truth be told,
we don't want the scroll.

1163
01:28:18,037 --> 01:28:20,665
I just want to use this opportunity
to fight you, Shira.

1164
01:28:21,070 --> 01:28:22,155
Fight me?

1165
01:28:22,630 --> 01:28:24,233
You and I both…

1166
01:28:24,258 --> 01:28:26,176
have been taught by Lord Gaara.

1167
01:28:27,674 --> 01:28:31,434
We are the ones who will carry out
Lord Gaara the Kazakage's will…

1168
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:34,301
and support
the Hidden Sand Village.

1169
01:28:34,981 --> 01:28:37,275
I want to make sure
we deserve that right.

1170
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:41,816
Fine. I accept your challenge.

1171
01:28:43,129 --> 01:28:44,255
Is this okay?

1172
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:45,698
If that's what you wish, Shira.

1173
01:28:46,362 --> 01:28:47,405
Y-Yeah…

1174
01:28:49,336 --> 01:28:51,213
Thank you, Shira.

1175
01:28:52,243 --> 01:28:54,454
Who are they?

1176
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:58,666
The promising youthful power that
will sustain the future of the Sand…

1177
01:28:59,266 --> 01:29:03,144
I believe in them and
have high hopes for them.

1178
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:08,760
Those who wish to hunt me
are free to do so…

1179
01:29:09,298 --> 01:29:13,302
However, do not involve those youths.

1180
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:17,393
I don't want them colored with
hatred and vengeance.

1181
01:29:18,312 --> 01:29:19,605
Come on, Matsuri!

1182
01:29:20,024 --> 01:29:21,192
Right!

1183
01:29:36,234 --> 01:29:40,572
There were times when
I doubted myself as the Kazekage.

1184
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:45,088
But after coming into contact
with them,

1185
01:29:45,129 --> 01:29:50,385
I realized that perhaps even
someone like me can accomplish things.

1186
01:29:51,511 --> 01:29:55,948
I want to erase hatred
from Hidden Sand Village,

1187
01:29:55,973 --> 01:29:58,351
and create bonds with people
I can call friends…

1188
01:29:58,376 --> 01:30:01,379
Friends who understand and
share each other's pain.

1189
01:30:03,773 --> 01:30:07,026
If you object, then take my head.

1190
01:30:07,835 --> 01:30:10,004
But leave them out of this.

1191
01:30:38,349 --> 01:30:39,350
Come on.

1192
01:30:53,759 --> 01:30:55,241
Thank you very much.

1193
01:30:59,495 --> 01:31:00,496
Please take this.

1194
01:31:02,081 --> 01:31:03,166
– Huh?!
– Huh?!

1195
01:31:07,259 --> 01:31:08,693
This won't work…

1196
01:31:19,098 --> 01:31:21,559
<i>Lord Gaara has matured indeed.</i>

1197
01:31:21,867 --> 01:31:26,808
<i>Perhaps we old soldiers
worried needlessly.</i>

1198
01:31:27,707 --> 01:31:31,210
<i>We must let the horrible memories
of the past fade into the darkness...</i>

1199
01:31:31,235 --> 01:31:34,614
<i>And leave it to the next generation
to build a new future.</i>

1200
01:31:37,106 --> 01:31:40,318
<i>I alone was responsible
for all of this.</i>

1201
01:32:13,861 --> 01:32:16,197
Please accept these.

1202
01:32:16,590 --> 01:32:19,217
Two "Heaven" scrolls
are not acceptable!

1203
01:32:19,242 --> 01:32:21,202
Oh, but that's—!

1204
01:32:21,502 --> 01:32:23,379
No, no, no!

1205
01:32:23,404 --> 01:32:26,323
I can't reveals any details, but there were
extraordinary circumstances

1206
01:32:26,348 --> 01:32:28,392
that prevented us
from collecting scrolls!

1207
01:32:28,876 --> 01:32:30,962
Please ask Lord Kazekage!

1208
01:32:31,587 --> 01:32:34,131
It doesn't matter what circumstances
there were. No means no!

1209
01:32:34,173 --> 01:32:35,466
You are stingy!

1210
01:32:35,716 --> 01:32:37,510
– Now, now…
– Just give it up.

1211
01:32:37,552 --> 01:32:41,055
No…! I can't just give up!

1212
01:32:45,726 --> 01:32:47,520
Cancel the Third Exam?

1213
01:32:48,062 --> 01:32:48,989
I'm sorry.

1214
01:32:49,438 --> 01:32:51,816
I can't go into details,

1215
01:32:51,974 --> 01:32:54,018
but this is a domestic matter
within the Sand.

1216
01:32:54,043 --> 01:32:56,212
Then how do we determine
who passed the Chunin Exams?

1217
01:32:56,711 --> 01:32:59,338
We've prepared detailed reports

1218
01:32:59,507 --> 01:33:01,759
about each team's performance
in the Second Exam.

1219
01:33:02,356 --> 01:33:04,733
I'd like the respective villages
to use them

1220
01:33:05,135 --> 01:33:07,683
to decide whether their participants
should be promoted to chunin.

1221
01:33:09,292 --> 01:33:12,712
Well, these exams were meant
to test their ability

1222
01:33:12,753 --> 01:33:15,798
to carry out missions as chunin…

1223
01:33:16,007 --> 01:33:18,426
It can't be helped if
things turned out like this.

1224
01:33:18,843 --> 01:33:22,430
But the participants put their lives
on the line to cross the Demon Desert…

1225
01:33:22,471 --> 01:33:24,223
Will they be satisfied with this?

1226
01:33:24,807 --> 01:33:26,475
I understand that.

1227
01:33:30,313 --> 01:33:32,356
Looks like the Third Exam
is cancelled.

1228
01:33:32,607 --> 01:33:34,984
What happens to
the Chunin Exams then?

1229
01:33:35,570 --> 01:33:38,699
I did have a bad feeling
about this…

1230
01:33:38,946 --> 01:33:42,283
Does that mean all that effort
was for nothing?!

1231
01:33:42,491 --> 01:33:45,786
We continued to the very end and
didn't give up, so we should be okay.

1232
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:49,093
Those who dropped out midway
are the ones who should be worried.

1233
01:33:50,124 --> 01:33:51,709
I sort of feel sorry for them.

1234
01:33:52,126 --> 01:33:55,755
All we gained was hunger
and exhaustion.

1235
01:33:56,423 --> 01:33:58,300
That's no gain!

1236
01:33:58,752 --> 01:34:01,296
At the very least,
perhaps we gained self-confidence.

1237
01:34:07,852 --> 01:34:11,022
Exam participants!
I commend your hard efforts!

1238
01:34:13,105 --> 01:34:14,492
With the passage of time,

1239
01:34:14,517 --> 01:34:19,247
our shinobi world needs
a new system with new laws.

1240
01:34:20,029 --> 01:34:23,574
Until today, we shinobi were
required to sacrifice

1241
01:34:23,599 --> 01:34:26,685
even the lives of our comrades
for the sake of our laws and rules.

1242
01:34:27,370 --> 01:34:30,456
But I have realized that we have
something even more precious

1243
01:34:30,498 --> 01:34:32,375
than rules and regulations.

1244
01:34:36,714 --> 01:34:41,025
That is friendship, with our
fellow villagers, our fellow shinobi,

1245
01:34:41,050 --> 01:34:44,345
and the bond we share with others
who understand the same pain…

1246
01:34:45,179 --> 01:34:47,365
I believe that

1247
01:34:47,390 --> 01:34:51,435
each of you who stands here now
knows exactly what I mean.

1248
01:34:52,335 --> 01:34:56,374
Therefore, I deem
the Third Exam unnecessary…

1249
01:34:56,399 --> 01:35:00,152
Furthermore, I am rescinding part of
the requirements for the Second Exam.

1250
01:35:00,236 --> 01:35:02,113
So what does that mean?

1251
01:35:02,279 --> 01:35:05,950
For each of you standing
here right now,

1252
01:35:06,130 --> 01:35:09,843
a detailed report of your performance
will be sent to your respective villages.

1253
01:35:10,409 --> 01:35:16,248
Your Kage will make the final decision
on your promotion.

1254
01:35:16,711 --> 01:35:18,337
That means we have
to wait longer?

1255
01:35:18,379 --> 01:35:21,924
But it also means we still
have a chance, correct?

1256
01:35:38,399 --> 01:35:41,402
When you reach
the northern border, be careful.

1257
01:35:41,819 --> 01:35:42,862
Thank you.

1258
01:35:43,446 --> 01:35:46,365
Yome, since you're going up
there too, try to be nice!

1259
01:35:46,390 --> 01:35:48,934
Huh?! What? Huh?!

1260
01:35:49,368 --> 01:35:52,621
We got assigned to
the same place by chance, that's all!

1261
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:54,957
Yeah, sure!

1262
01:35:55,332 --> 01:35:56,542
Go for it!

1263
01:36:01,005 --> 01:36:02,339
Yome, let's go!

1264
01:36:03,924 --> 01:36:06,427
Hey, wait up!

1265
01:36:07,365 --> 01:36:09,618
I hope they're going to be okay!

1266
01:36:28,224 --> 01:36:31,644
We've gone through the report
from the Hidden Sand,

1267
01:36:31,803 --> 01:36:35,139
and your chunin promotion
has been approved.

1268
01:36:35,164 --> 01:36:36,540
Thank you.

1269
01:36:36,874 --> 01:36:41,921
And I'm going to assign you
to an S-rank mission right away.

1270
01:36:53,173 --> 01:36:56,802
I've gone over
your Second Exam reports.

1271
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:03,359
And…Hinata, Shino, Kiba,
Choji, Ino and Sakura…

1272
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:06,570
You six passed with flying colors
and are promoted to chunin!

1273
01:37:08,531 --> 01:37:12,535
<i>After all, we didn't have
the second scroll…</i>

1274
01:37:12,993 --> 01:37:15,412
Komugi, Gennai, Inaho…

1275
01:37:16,038 --> 01:37:18,958
You will be given another chance
next time.

1276
01:37:21,502 --> 01:37:25,506
Finally…although they did not
collect two scrolls,

1277
01:37:26,131 --> 01:37:28,384
they performed admirably…

1278
01:37:28,425 --> 01:37:31,345
and are more than qualified
for promotion.

1279
01:37:31,595 --> 01:37:33,472
Lee and Tenten,
you are now chunin.

1280
01:37:37,335 --> 01:37:38,253
Lady Tsunade!

1281
01:37:38,532 --> 01:37:42,536
Team Guy is one for all, all for one!
How can Neji not be included…?!

1282
01:37:42,561 --> 01:37:44,104
Just let me finish!

1283
01:37:44,733 --> 01:37:47,862
Neji Hyuga is given a special
double promotion to jonin!

1284
01:37:48,988 --> 01:37:50,447
The Kazekage himself noted,

1285
01:37:50,489 --> 01:37:52,408
"In particular, Neji's performance
was most impressive and"

1286
01:37:52,408 --> 01:37:54,410
"due consideration has
been given in this report."

1287
01:37:56,161 --> 01:37:58,664
He's already proven himself to be
more than capable as a chunin.

1288
01:38:01,721 --> 01:38:03,222
Way to go, Neji!

1289
01:38:03,312 --> 01:38:04,470
Congratulations!

1290
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:06,463
Thank you very much!

1291
01:38:08,549 --> 01:38:10,676
Thank you to you both.

1292
01:38:11,385 --> 01:38:15,431
I made it to chunin because
of Team Guy's teamwork.

1293
01:38:15,827 --> 01:38:18,538
Our three-man squad is forever, right?

1294
01:38:18,893 --> 01:38:20,686
Yes, I hope so.

1295
01:38:20,978 --> 01:38:23,105
I finally overtook Naruto!

1296
01:38:23,981 --> 01:38:28,319
He's going to be so mad that
he missed the Chunin Exams.

1297
01:38:29,111 --> 01:38:32,489
I wonder what kind of training
Naruto is doing now…

1298
01:38:37,953 --> 01:38:40,289
<i>It will soon be time to
wrap up training</i>

1299
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:42,541
<i>and return to Hidden Leaf Village.</i>

1300
01:38:43,566 --> 01:38:45,150
Ouch!

1301
01:38:45,961 --> 01:38:47,838
That chest wound still hurts, right?

1302
01:38:48,422 --> 01:38:50,674
Pervy Sage, you just rest up!

1303
01:38:52,217 --> 01:38:54,845
I'm gonna continue my training!

1304
01:40:28,587 --> 01:40:29,588
Yourou!

1305
01:40:29,773 --> 01:40:30,983
I know...We're being followed.

1306
01:40:33,110 --> 01:40:34,862
Fuu...Let's go to that rocky area for now.

1307
01:40:35,362 --> 01:40:37,865
What? How boring.

1308
01:40:41,628 --> 01:40:43,171
We don't know who you are…

1309
01:40:43,495 --> 01:40:45,372
But we've been on to you
for a while now.

1310
01:40:49,001 --> 01:40:51,545
I told him to stop…

1311
01:40:51,587 --> 01:40:54,131
since not being able to kill you
is such a pain in the butt.

1312
01:40:56,008 --> 01:40:59,845
Say, mister! Aren't you a former
Hidden Waterfall?

1313
01:41:01,597 --> 01:41:02,598
What?

1314
01:41:02,721 --> 01:41:06,183
I know you! After your failed Hokage
assassination attempt,

1315
01:41:06,208 --> 01:41:08,794
you stole the hearts of
the village elders and escaped…

1316
01:41:08,885 --> 01:41:10,303
You're Kakuzu!

1317
01:41:10,481 --> 01:41:11,523
Kakuzu?!

1318
01:41:11,565 --> 01:41:13,817
Impossible! How old does
that make him?!

1319
01:41:13,817 --> 01:41:16,278
I always thought if
I got to meet you,

1320
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,781
I'd like to be your friend!

1321
01:41:19,698 --> 01:41:21,658
Kakuzu...Is she stupid?

1322
01:41:22,034 --> 01:41:23,202
I wouldn't know.

1323
01:41:23,227 --> 01:41:26,272
I deserted the village
a long time ago.

1324
01:41:26,371 --> 01:41:30,328
How about we start out as
casual acquaintances over tea?

1325
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:36,673
I didn't come here today
to become your friend…

1326
01:41:38,217 --> 01:41:40,886
Well, that's too bad…
