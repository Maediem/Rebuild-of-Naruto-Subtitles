1
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:12,053
The Eight-Tails, huh?

2
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:16,224
<i>It seems Sasuke was successful.</i>

3
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:19,144
Pain will bring the Nine-Tails.

4
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,027
Not only Yugito,
but now Bee too...

5
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,696
I cannot believe that Bee
has been taken down!

6
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:34,768
We have been receiving several
messenger lizards from Jay.

7
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,097
Once we've pinpointed
the enemy's whereabouts,

8
00:00:37,122 --> 00:00:40,250
we'll send in four cells to
rescue Lord Killer Bee,

9
00:00:40,518 --> 00:00:41,907
and wipe out the enemy.

10
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:47,088
I heard it was an Uchiha from the Hidden
Leaf who kidnapped my little brother!

11
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,674
Why is there an Uchiha
in the Akatsuki?!

12
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,968
Sasuke Uchiha...

13
00:00:52,123 --> 00:00:55,626
It appears he went rogue from the
Hidden Leaf quite some time ago.

14
00:00:55,747 --> 00:00:59,417
Why hasn't the Leaf's Hokage dealt
with this rogue ninja?!

15
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,103
They were so quick to react
over the Hyuga incident!

16
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:13,156
You are so useless!

17
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,992
Why'd you leave behind
my Executioner's Blade?!

18
00:01:16,085 --> 00:01:17,712
Shut up, Suigetsu!

19
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,705
Just be thankful
we didn't leave you behind!

20
00:01:20,885 --> 00:01:24,639
Look who's talking!
You were also passed out, Karin!

21
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,712
I got knocked out trying
to protect you guys!

22
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,007
It's the result of us trying
to protect each other.

23
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:34,594
We're like fish and water, so close
we can't do without one another.

24
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,012
So quit quarreling.

25
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:39,043
Fine.

26
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,142
By the way, are we really
going to get

27
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,936
the Tailed Beast's power, Sasuke?

28
00:01:43,315 --> 00:01:45,442
Hmph. Who knows?

29
00:01:45,821 --> 00:01:49,909
But it seems there's no need
to rely on that anymore.

30
00:01:53,168 --> 00:01:54,586
What's wrong, Sasuke?

31
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:01,543
It's nothing.

32
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:06,584
I sense a chakra outside.
It seems we've been tailed.

33
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,052
Now, go!

34
00:02:20,834 --> 00:02:22,752
Forgive me, Lord Raikage...

35
00:02:24,836 --> 00:02:27,464
It appears my tail was unsuccessful.

36
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:33,820
What?!

37
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,615
What do you mean the messages
from Jay have ceased?!

38
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:41,703
It seems Jay has either
been killed or captured.

39
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:45,427
So we're unable to confirm
the enemy's location.

40
00:02:46,503 --> 00:02:49,881
Use whatever information we have
to narrow down the location,

41
00:02:49,976 --> 00:02:51,727
and search every inch
of the place!

42
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,215
I don't care if you have
to dispatch a battalion!

43
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,467
Y-Yes sir.

44
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,747
Summon Samui's platoon too!

45
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:02,580
I'm giving them a document of
intent to deliver to the Hidden Leaf

46
00:03:02,605 --> 00:03:04,482
stating that we will take care
of Sasuke Uchiha!

47
00:03:04,737 --> 00:03:06,614
And have them give us
intel on him!

48
00:03:06,755 --> 00:03:08,089
Yes, right away!

49
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,447
Furthermore, I'm going to convene

50
00:03:11,472 --> 00:03:13,766
a Five Kage Summit Conference
with the Five Great Nations!

51
00:03:14,404 --> 00:03:16,885
The Akatsuki will not be forgiven!

52
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,322
Jay...

53
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,699
We were too late.

54
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,088
Omoi, Karui...
Lord Raikage has summoned us.

55
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,548
Summoned, eh?

56
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:19,884
What in the world could it be?

57
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:23,137
Maybe there's a crisis...

58
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:26,432
Or maybe...We're getting scolded?

59
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,811
Did he find out that my body fat
percentage has spiked?

60
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:34,380
Maybe eating potatoes with
mayonnaise wasn't a good idea?

61
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:38,194
Omoi, you always think too much!

62
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,196
Why would he scold you
for something like that?!

63
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,463
The most that would happen is you
could get sent to buy some protein.

64
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,412
Being around you guys
is so tiring.

65
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:50,373
Makes my shoulders ache.

66
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,085
The stiff shoulders are probably
caused by those big breasts of yours,

67
00:04:54,703 --> 00:04:56,705
although one can't say for sure.

68
00:04:56,883 --> 00:04:59,135
What you thought was just
a stiff shoulder could actually...

69
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,177
Will you shut up!
Quit yakking and let's go!

70
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,972
You ought to think things
through more carefully.

71
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,154
A flat-chested person like you
may not get stiff shoulders, Karui, but...

72
00:05:09,179 --> 00:05:10,722
Shut up!

73
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:13,415
Oww! Now that kick will cause...

74
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,555
You got more to say?!

75
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:17,576
You two...
If you're ninja, act cooler.

76
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,068
Let's go!

77
00:05:21,365 --> 00:05:22,699
Mission acknowledged.

78
00:05:23,304 --> 00:05:24,389
I'm counting on you!

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,670
I knew it...
I had a bad feeling about this.

80
00:05:28,014 --> 00:05:28,870
Damn!

81
00:05:29,506 --> 00:05:30,799
Don't worry!

82
00:05:30,824 --> 00:05:33,202
No way Lord Killer Bee would
screw up like that.

83
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:35,706
It's probably some bad joke.

84
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:41,090
How can you be optimistic?!

85
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,134
He could be suffering right
this moment!

86
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:44,886
In fact, he could already...

87
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:49,724
Shut up! I don't want to hear
your pessimistic thoughts!

88
00:05:50,395 --> 00:05:51,688
He's our master!

89
00:05:51,713 --> 00:05:53,382
We're talking about
Lord Killer Bee here!

90
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,521
There's no way he'd be defeated!

91
00:05:55,838 --> 00:05:58,216
Aren't you worried about Lord Bee, Karui?

92
00:05:58,241 --> 00:06:01,542
Don't get morbid ideas just
because you're worried!

93
00:06:01,618 --> 00:06:03,203
Enough, you two!

94
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:08,493
We'll save Bee,
no matter what it takes!

95
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,177
We will save him!

96
00:06:11,235 --> 00:06:12,736
<i>- Lord Raikage!
- Lord Raikage!</i>

97
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,681
Oh, it's you, Kakashi Sensei.

98
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:34,268
Lady Hokage has summoned you.
Let's go.

99
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,325
Huh? Chief Toad and Gamakichi?

100
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,368
Yo, Naruto!

101
00:08:14,831 --> 00:08:17,375
What're you guys doing here
so early?

102
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:18,706
Did something happen?

103
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,000
Actually...

104
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:24,462
Gamakichi! It's not your place
to say anything.

105
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:28,508
Leave this to the Boss and Tsunade.

106
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,179
What's going on?

107
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,056
Just hurry up.

108
00:08:48,107 --> 00:08:50,818
He is Jiraiya-boy's student?

109
00:08:51,192 --> 00:08:53,611
Yes...This is Naruto Uzumaki...

110
00:08:54,113 --> 00:08:55,948
The "Child of Prophecy"
you mentioned.

111
00:08:57,317 --> 00:09:00,028
A geezer frog? What the hell?

112
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,500
Hey! Watch your mouth, Naruto!

113
00:09:03,336 --> 00:09:07,131
This is Lord Fukasaku, one of the
Two Great Sages of Mount Myoboku.

114
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,258
He came all the way here
to speak with you.

115
00:09:11,273 --> 00:09:13,943
Well, to be more accurate,
I am a Great Sage Toad.

116
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,222
But never mind that.

117
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:20,393
You are, without a doubt,
Jiraiya-boy's student.

118
00:09:20,876 --> 00:09:23,336
Jiraiya-boy? "Boy"?!

119
00:09:23,787 --> 00:09:25,998
You talk as though
the Pervy Sage is a kid!

120
00:09:26,182 --> 00:09:28,560
Who does this geezer frog
think he is?!

121
00:09:28,739 --> 00:09:30,533
I said to watch your mouth!

122
00:09:31,634 --> 00:09:35,287
This great man is the one who
taught Sage Jutsu to Lord Jiraiya.

123
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,812
He is Lord Jiraiya's master.

124
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,998
Pervy Sage, eh?

125
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,001
What a fitting nickname
for Jiraiya-boy.

126
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:49,380
So what does this geezer sage
want with me?

127
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,467
I'm not sure where to begin.

128
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,386
But let's see...

129
00:09:55,945 --> 00:09:58,073
I suppose
the most important thing is...

130
00:09:59,421 --> 00:10:01,757
Jiraiya-boy has died in battle.

131
00:10:02,865 --> 00:10:03,628
Huh?

132
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,772
Wh-What are you talking about?

133
00:10:11,393 --> 00:10:13,572
I know this is sudden.

134
00:10:13,597 --> 00:10:16,141
I don't blame you if
you don't believe me.

135
00:10:19,212 --> 00:10:22,165
For quite some time,
there were rumors

136
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,910
that the leader of the Akatsuki
was in the Hidden Rain Village.

137
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:30,588
Jiraiya-boy went in person to
verify the truth of these rumors.

138
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:34,216
The leader of the Akatsuki was
in the Hidden Rain Village?

139
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:38,304
As I recall,
that village is difficult to infiltrate.

140
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,973
A village closed to the outside world.

141
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,427
Yes...However, Lord Jiraiya was skilled

142
00:10:44,452 --> 00:10:47,214
in infiltration and
espionage tactics.

143
00:10:48,044 --> 00:10:49,337
Exactly...

144
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,192
However...

145
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,878
To corner a ninja like Lord Jiraiya...

146
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,155
How did this Pain...?

147
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,700
He possessed the Rinnegan.

148
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:00,993
What did you say?!

149
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:03,954
Rinnegan?

150
00:11:05,263 --> 00:11:06,622
The Rinnegan is an Ocular Jutsu

151
00:11:06,647 --> 00:11:10,711
that was said to be possessed by the father
of all ninja, the Sage of the Six Paths.

152
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,881
I thought it was just a legend.

153
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,633
Not only that...

154
00:11:16,998 --> 00:11:19,000
There were six of them
who possessed the Rinnegan?!

155
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,805
How can that even be possible?

156
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,475
Most likely, only Jiraiya-boy,
who was there,

157
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:26,883
discovered their secret.

158
00:11:27,057 --> 00:11:27,853
But...

159
00:11:30,163 --> 00:11:31,498
<i>Jiraiya-boy!</i>

160
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:36,904
Even after he had his throat
crushed by Pain,

161
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:40,658
Jiraiya-boy left a message
before collapsing.

162
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,911
This is that message!

163
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:48,258
It's a code...

164
00:11:51,074 --> 00:11:54,411
I'm sure he did this to prevent
Pain from noticing.

165
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,718
I've told you everything
about Jiraiya-boy.

166
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,682
Did you...let him go, Granny?

167
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:13,774
That's right.

168
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,402
Why'd you allow such
a reckless thing?!

169
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,191
You knew Pervy Sage better
than anyone!

170
00:12:20,544 --> 00:12:22,466
How could you send him to such
a dangerous place, alone?!

171
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:23,492
Enough, Naruto.

172
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,329
You of all people ought to
know Lady Hokage's feelings.

173
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,547
Naruto! Where are you going?!

174
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,509
If Pervy Sage had been
the Fifth Hokage...

175
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,690
he wouldn't have let Granny Tsunade
take such risks...

176
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:46,432
Never!

177
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,022
Naruto!

178
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:56,859
Sakura...It's all right.
Let him be.

179
00:12:57,775 --> 00:12:58,612
But...

180
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:03,949
I can see that child truly loved
and admired Jiraiya-boy.

181
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:09,580
I can't help but hope that
he is the Child of Prophecy.

182
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:17,782
Anyway, the clues left by Jiraiya-boy...

183
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,927
There is something besides
the hidden message on my back.

184
00:13:23,445 --> 00:13:29,076
A Hidden Rain ninja captured by
Jiraiya-boy is inside his belly.

185
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,667
And, one more thing...

186
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:42,029
Inside this fellow is one of Pain's bodies
that Jiraiya managed to kill.

187
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,074
Pain's?

188
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,748
This is Pain...

189
00:13:53,337 --> 00:13:56,590
The ripple pattern...
Is it the legendary Rinnegan?

190
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:03,175
That's correct. If we study it well, we
may find clues on how to defeat him.

191
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:07,590
A ninja's corpse is
a treasure trove of information.

192
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,806
We will gather skilled medical ninja,
and begin an autopsy immediately.

193
00:14:12,966 --> 00:14:13,675
Shizune.

194
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,604
Yes, ma'am. I will take care of it.

195
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,072
Hmm...That is a good photo.

196
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,450
I have given you all that
was entrusted to me.

197
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:29,952
Yes, indeed.

198
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,289
I will return home now.
Let me know what you learn.

199
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,583
With Jiraiya-boy's student here,

200
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:38,419
you will be able to
contact Mount Myoboku.

201
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:40,754
Thank you very much.

202
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:45,217
I promise that we will find
a way to defeat Pain!

203
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,168
<i>Now listen, Naruto.</i>

204
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,901
<i>I have only three years to
make you strong.</i>

205
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,737
I will spend that time
training you vigorously.

206
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,988
Be prepared for that.

207
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:11,076
You bet! This time, I'm going to
bring him back for sure!

208
00:15:11,808 --> 00:15:14,060
There's no time for me to waste.

209
00:15:19,601 --> 00:15:21,395
Cripes...I can't stand this...

210
00:15:21,771 --> 00:15:24,106
What is this?!
What's with this lame training?!

211
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:27,384
Fool! Nothing in training is lame!

212
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,427
You foolish student!

213
00:15:36,922 --> 00:15:37,964
You're mine!

214
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:45,444
You're not the only one
who uses Shadow Clones.

215
00:15:45,798 --> 00:15:48,175
You're still so naïve...

216
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,790
Damn! I was so close!

217
00:15:57,815 --> 00:16:01,861
Liar. It'll take a hundred years
before you can beat me.

218
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,463
I can't wait a hundred years!

219
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:07,257
Just wait...Next time...

220
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,982
This is super-cool!

221
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:26,235
Hmm...Fine feathers make
a fine bird, eh?

222
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,951
Yo! Naruto.

223
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:42,209
I hear you've been real active
on missions and such.

224
00:16:42,456 --> 00:16:44,291
Everyone in the village
is talking about you.

225
00:16:45,803 --> 00:16:47,888
Hey, let's go somewhere and catch up!

226
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,509
How about Ichiraku for some ramen?

227
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,682
No thanks...

228
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,074
What? Right now?

229
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:17,536
Yes. Take that,
and go immediately.

230
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:23,083
The Cipher Corps folks
don't work this late.

231
00:17:23,431 --> 00:17:25,808
Summon them and tell them
it's on my orders.

232
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,683
I'm putting you in charge of this case.

233
00:17:30,356 --> 00:17:33,025
I know it's a very important encryption,

234
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,845
but can't you ask someone else
who's not on a mission right now?

235
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,265
Wait...Where are you going?

236
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,559
I came here on a different matter.

237
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,560
Shikamaru!

238
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:43,896
But...

239
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:47,786
Lady Tsunade has been busy
since morning, and...

240
00:17:56,992 --> 00:18:01,413
<i>I must say...
You've grown even more beautiful.</i>

241
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,873
<i>You haven't changed...</i>

242
00:18:07,965 --> 00:18:12,636
<i>But...If you try anything to
betray the village...</i>

243
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,970
<i>At that moment, I will kill you.</i>

244
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,645
<i>Then how about making a bet with me?</i>

245
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:30,442
<i>You bet that I will die.
After all, you always lose.</i>

246
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:35,447
<i>But if I make it back alive...</i>

247
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:38,759
<i>Joking! I'm just joking!</i>

248
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,828
<i>You know, I'm grateful to you.</i>

249
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,587
<i>Heya...I'm Jiraiya!</i>

250
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,798
<i>You can send me the love letters later!</i>

251
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,258
<i>Nice to meet ya!</i>

252
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,099
You fool...

253
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,552
Naruto...

254
00:20:26,132 --> 00:20:28,301
I heard about Lord Jiraiya.

255
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:37,861
I wanted him to keep watching
over me.

256
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,699
I wanted him to see me
become the Hokage.

257
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:48,121
But I only ended up showing Pervy Sage
the worst, most un-cool side of me.

258
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:51,708
I was...

259
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:55,379
Lord Jiraiya only had praise for you.

260
00:20:56,018 --> 00:20:57,811
He was always boasting about you,

261
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:00,259
saying you were like
his own grandchild.

262
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,763
He had faith that you were
the one who would inherit his will.

263
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:09,142
And truly believed that you would
one day become a great Hokage.

264
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:14,022
Lord Jiraiya will always
watch over you.

265
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:18,110
Even this very minute,
he's watching from somewhere.

266
00:21:19,452 --> 00:21:24,165
He wouldn't be happy
seeing you sad like this. So...

267
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:30,706
Be your usual self,
the one he praised so much.

268
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,624
Don't stay depressed forever.

269
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:37,754
For Lord Jiraiya himself,
one of the Legendary Sannin...

270
00:21:40,253 --> 00:21:42,463
acknowledged you as
his promising student!

271
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:57,482
Thanks...Iruka Sensei.

272
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,425
Thank you for your efforts.
How's it going?

273
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,468
Oh...

274
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,877
I checked very carefully...

275
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:20,173
But this isn't a Hidden Leaf code.

276
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:23,175
It doesn't correspond to any
of our algorithms.

277
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:27,512
But considering the fact that Lord
Jiraiya wrote this in his dying moments,

278
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:30,349
I don't think it could be
anything too complex.

279
00:22:31,255 --> 00:22:34,284
It's a string of numbers, so it
has to be a shared-key encryption.

280
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,189
Can you...decode it?

281
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:38,857
Ahem.

282
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:44,196
Err...Frankly, it's impossible
unless we know the key.

283
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,698
Key?

284
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:51,912
Namely, if you don't know the rules
that define the code, you can't break it.

285
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:57,167
Unless we know something about Lord Jiraiya
that could be the key, it's impossible.

286
00:22:57,467 --> 00:22:59,969
So how do we figure out what the key is?

287
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,130
I wouldn't know...

288
00:23:02,369 --> 00:23:05,581
But perhaps someone who
was close to Lord Jiraiya

289
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:08,221
would recognize the key.

290
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,889
Although, given the circumstances
of his death,

291
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,683
the encryption could have
been hastily created

292
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,311
to prevent the enemy from
discerning his message.

293
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,021
So we can't say for certain.

294
00:23:18,727 --> 00:23:21,229
Consider who he may have
intended that message for,

295
00:23:21,254 --> 00:23:24,799
and ask that person.
And perhaps you'll find some clues.

296
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,614
Which means...

297
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,909
<i>Lady Hokage or Kakashi Sensei...</i>

298
00:23:35,652 --> 00:23:37,488
Thank you very much.

299
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,544
If I learn anything new,
I'll come again.

300
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:47,008
Sure, but I'll be home in bed,
so just come by the house, ok?

301
00:23:47,828 --> 00:23:50,080
Well...I'm heading home to sleep.

302
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:52,641
What about you, Shiho?

303
00:23:54,222 --> 00:23:57,142
Someone's gotta stay behind.

304
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:06,319
This frog supposedly contains
a captured Hidden Rain ninja.

305
00:24:07,032 --> 00:24:09,868
We received prior notice
from Lord Jiraiya.

306
00:24:10,876 --> 00:24:12,628
Now, grow.

307
00:24:18,694 --> 00:24:20,488
Be as rough as you need to be.

308
00:24:20,615 --> 00:24:21,908
Get everything you can from him!

309
00:24:22,235 --> 00:24:23,444
I intend to.

310
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:31,437
This is one of the three crucial sources
of data Lord Jiraiya left us.

311
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,890
We must learn everything
we can from it.

312
00:24:35,028 --> 00:24:36,070
- Yes, Ma'am!
- Yes, Ma'am!

313
00:24:36,095 --> 00:24:37,679
All right. Let's begin.

314
00:24:39,329 --> 00:24:45,293
9...31...8...106...7...207...15...

315
00:24:45,794 --> 00:24:47,624
Can you think of anything?

316
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:51,158
Maybe in a conversation
with Lord Jiraiya?

317
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:53,126
Something about these numbers...?

318
00:24:59,597 --> 00:25:02,225
This number 106 is...

319
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,132
Lord Jiraiya?

320
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,968
It's 106.

321
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,054
What is?

322
00:25:19,813 --> 00:25:21,773
<i>106 centimeters.</i>

323
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,067
No...That's not it.

324
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,487
I can't think of anything.

325
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,813
Why don't you try
Lady Hokage or Naruto next?

326
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:36,802
I already asked Lady Hokage.

327
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,956
Which leaves Naruto...

328
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:43,092
The secret code is a concern.

329
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:47,337
But I'm also worried about Naruto.
Try to cheer him up.

330
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:51,550
Don't get your hopes up too high.

331
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:03,228
Shoot...He's out.

332
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:15,474
Shikamaru...What do you want?

333
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,662
For starters...Can I come in?

334
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,960
Well? Can you think of anything?

335
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:35,135
Hey Naruto, I said can you think
of anything?

336
00:26:38,703 --> 00:26:39,704
Naruto!

337
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:45,478
Oh sorry. What was it again?

338
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:49,983
Come with me.

339
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:51,901
Where?

340
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,278
Just come.

341
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,822
Wh-What is it?!

342
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,783
Why'd you bring me here?

343
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,535
Just wait.

344
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,079
Ah! Here she comes.

345
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,546
Huh?! Kurenai Sensei...

346
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,881
Yeah...

347
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:15,525
Were you hospitalized for
eating too much barbeque?!

348
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,093
Your stomach's bigger than Choji's!

349
00:27:17,196 --> 00:27:19,698
She's pregnant, not fat!

350
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:23,741
Cripes, you're still
as obnoxious as ever.

351
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:24,530
Huh?!

352
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,811
You mean...she's...?

353
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:31,107
Shikamaru, stop coming here so often.

354
00:27:31,882 --> 00:27:36,387
Sorry, no can do.
Asuma asked me to do so.

355
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:45,158
Shikamaru...What did Asuma
ask you to do?

356
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:48,583
That child will be my student.

357
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:49,784
Huh?

358
00:27:50,316 --> 00:27:52,985
Asuma entrusted that child to me.

359
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,966
I heard about Lord Jiraiya.

360
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,763
I lost my teacher,

361
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:04,391
so it's not like I don't understand
what you're going through.

362
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,646
But whining and sulking isn't going
to make things better.

363
00:28:11,818 --> 00:28:14,487
We're way past that point in our lives.

364
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,153
What do you mean?

365
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,658
My teacher entrusted me
with many things.

366
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:26,162
Some important, some petty.
All sorts of things.

367
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,581
You too, right?

368
00:28:29,439 --> 00:28:31,941
In fact, you must have a ton of stuff.

369
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:36,426
So don't you think it's about time
for us to step up?

370
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,591
Time for what?

371
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:42,804
Time for us to become
the ones who entrust.

372
00:28:44,028 --> 00:28:47,031
It's a pain,
but we can't keep complaining.

373
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:51,646
You will eventually be
the one treating to ramen,

374
00:28:51,671 --> 00:28:53,923
and you'll be called Naruto Sensei,
or something.

375
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:58,945
We can't stay brats forever...

376
00:29:00,088 --> 00:29:05,343
If we wanna become super cool ninja
like Asuma and Lord Jiraiya, that is.

377
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,715
You're right.

378
00:29:19,714 --> 00:29:21,174
Thanks, Shikamaru.

379
00:29:22,188 --> 00:29:24,106
Pull yourself together.

380
00:29:24,417 --> 00:29:26,961
You got work to do.

381
00:29:28,811 --> 00:29:29,812
Right!

382
00:29:36,388 --> 00:29:39,558
You haven't said a word.
You see something, right?

383
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:46,117
I talked to Lady Hokage
and Kakashi Sensei,

384
00:29:46,203 --> 00:29:47,538
but neither of them had any clue.

385
00:29:47,784 --> 00:29:51,663
That means Lord Jiraiya probably
left this message with you in mind.

386
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,125
No, I'm positive he did.

387
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:57,337
There's got to be something there.

388
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:01,174
If anything pops up in your mind,
tell us.

389
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,219
We're not asking you to
instantly decode the message.

390
00:30:06,863 --> 00:30:09,574
There is one thing that's been
bothering me since I first saw this.

391
00:30:09,737 --> 00:30:10,529
What is it?

392
00:30:10,554 --> 00:30:11,555
Well...

393
00:30:12,064 --> 00:30:13,774
There's all these numbers.

394
00:30:13,893 --> 00:30:16,773
So what's with this
one katakana letter?

395
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:17,732
Huh?

396
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:18,817
Katakana?

397
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:20,527
Where do you see that?

398
00:30:21,671 --> 00:30:22,672
Right here.

399
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:27,116
What are you talking about?
Isn't that the number "9"?

400
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,828
That's what I thought at first...

401
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:33,039
But this is not the number "9."

402
00:30:33,221 --> 00:30:34,722
It's the katakana letter "ta."

403
00:30:36,604 --> 00:30:39,440
Well, I guess you could
look at it that way.

404
00:30:39,782 --> 00:30:41,158
But I think that's a big stretch.

405
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:43,258
<i>I wonder...</i>

406
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:49,764
Uzumaki, what made you think
this nine was the katakana letter "ta"?

407
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,851
He was an author, after all.

408
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:56,062
And I traveled all over with him.

409
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:59,065
He always made me read
his handwritten drafts,

410
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,234
and asked what I thought about them.

411
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,862
They were really boring though...

412
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:09,742
<i>What the heck?</i>

413
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:13,872
<i>What's "Nine-ctics"?</i>

414
00:31:20,897 --> 00:31:24,150
And whenever there was
the letter "ta," it was hard to read

415
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,594
because it would look
like the number nine.

416
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,262
I see...A penmanship quirk!

417
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,972
That was his habit, huh?

418
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,477
So what you're saying is...

419
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,856
When writing the katakana "ta,"

420
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,038
Lord Jiraiya had a habit of
shortening his first stroke.

421
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,987
So the first and third strokes
get connected.

422
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:49,240
And since he rounds
his second stroke,

423
00:31:49,512 --> 00:31:51,639
it looks like the number nine.

424
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:56,146
Frankly, this was the common link
between Lord Jiraiya and Naruto.

425
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:01,127
Why didn't you mention such
an important thing sooner?!

426
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:04,964
Well, what's the big deal about
knowing that it's the letter "ta"?

427
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,510
The code refers to that
book you were reading!

428
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,347
That's it, Shikamaru!

429
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:17,822
Right! Frankly, Lord Jiraiya's book
must contain a hint.

430
00:32:18,385 --> 00:32:22,941
Those numbers must represent character
numbers, line numbers or page numbers.

431
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:25,944
I'm certain they hold the key
to the code.

432
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:28,154
Naruto, which book is it?

433
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:34,243
Umm...Hmm...Make-Out...
What was it?

434
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:37,914
Well then, how many of
Lord Jiraiya's books have been published?

435
00:32:38,188 --> 00:32:41,066
I'm not sure...Four? Five?

436
00:32:42,241 --> 00:32:44,938
Then let's just check all of them!

437
00:32:45,209 --> 00:32:47,086
It's probably this one.

438
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,011
Make-Out Tactics...

439
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,641
- "Ta"?!
- "Ta"?!

440
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,306
Kakashi Sensei!

441
00:32:56,318 --> 00:32:59,487
It's been on my mind, so I decided to
stop by when I overheard your voices.

442
00:32:59,989 --> 00:33:01,448
I think I caught most of it.

443
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,899
This is the book you're looking for.

444
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,026
"Make-Out Tactics."

445
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:08,820
That's right.

446
00:33:09,034 --> 00:33:12,996
That's the one Pervy Sage was
working on during our training.

447
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:17,203
I see...Only Naruto would've known that.

448
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:20,707
So Lord Jiraiya did pass
the key on to Naruto.

449
00:33:21,709 --> 00:33:22,590
Uh-huh!

450
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,742
This "ta" is the first character
in the code.

451
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:29,465
Of Lord Jiraiya's books, this is
the only title that begins with "ta."

452
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,510
When a character is used
in a code,

453
00:33:32,694 --> 00:33:35,455
it could signify word placement
or line number,

454
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,566
but the established protocol is
to check the page number first.

455
00:33:39,162 --> 00:33:42,165
So...the numbers separated
by commas

456
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:47,900
are 31, 8, 106, 7, 207, and 15.
Six sets.

457
00:33:48,267 --> 00:33:50,477
Meaning there are six pages
worth of information.

458
00:33:51,088 --> 00:33:52,798
Let's start with page 31.

459
00:33:53,207 --> 00:33:54,667
Flip to that page, please.

460
00:33:55,368 --> 00:33:57,036
Page 31...

461
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,203
Okay, here it is.

462
00:33:59,422 --> 00:34:01,007
Where do we look next?

463
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:05,267
In situations like this, we look
at the first character on the page.

464
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,337
Please read the sentence out loud
starting from the top.

465
00:34:08,695 --> 00:34:09,696
Wha-?

466
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:18,037
No...I mean...

467
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:22,602
What is it?! Hurry up and read!

468
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,909
Hurry it up!

469
00:34:30,536 --> 00:34:35,207
"I-I-I...really...

470
00:34:35,232 --> 00:34:36,984
love you."

471
00:34:47,594 --> 00:34:49,930
There! We now have all six pages.

472
00:34:50,606 --> 00:34:51,357
Well?

473
00:34:51,544 --> 00:34:54,923
If I read the first characters
of the code in order...

474
00:34:55,554 --> 00:34:59,975
The-Real-One's-Not-Among-Them...

475
00:35:00,197 --> 00:35:01,781
That's what it says.

476
00:35:02,785 --> 00:35:03,911
What does that mean?

477
00:35:04,087 --> 00:35:05,088
I don't know.

478
00:35:05,417 --> 00:35:08,503
We ought to relay this
to Lord Fukasaku.

479
00:35:09,261 --> 00:35:12,431
He fought with Pain,
so he may know something.

480
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:16,864
Then let's go right away to the Lady
Hokage to ask this Lord Fukasaku to come.

481
00:35:16,889 --> 00:35:18,766
May I come along?

482
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,910
Yeah, please do, Shiho.

483
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:22,519
Yes, sir!

484
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:26,958
All right! Let's go let Granny know!

485
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:31,462
"The-Real-One's-Not-Among-Them."

486
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:36,050
Well, Geezer Sage?! Anything?

487
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:43,224
<i>Of those six, not a single one
reminds me of Nagato.</i>

488
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:47,019
<i>Yet a completely unrelated Pain
knew of a conversation</i>

489
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:50,047
<i>that the Rinnegan-bearing Nagato
and I shared alone.</i>

490
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:54,110
<i>The faces are different,
but I definitely sense Nagato in them.</i>

491
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:59,448
I don't know...
This alone is too vague.

492
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:02,410
But there's something?

493
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:06,414
I've already told you
what I know about Pain.

494
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,876
Even if he dies,
he can resurrect himself.

495
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,879
So I can't say just from speculations.

496
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:16,591
Under such conditions,
taking Pain on is too dangerous.

497
00:36:17,255 --> 00:36:19,507
We must uncover all his secrets first.

498
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,013
What about the other sources
of information?

499
00:36:22,488 --> 00:36:24,075
How are the autopsy and
interrogation coming along?

500
00:36:24,343 --> 00:36:26,720
It looks like they will take
more time.

501
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,603
Like how long?

502
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,314
I can't say.

503
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:35,693
Oh, come on!
We can't be wasting time right now!

504
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:37,448
Interrogation aside,

505
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:43,075
an autopsy requires minute cell
and tissue analyses!

506
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,036
These things take time!

507
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,830
It'll be a week at the soonest.

508
00:36:48,608 --> 00:36:50,110
That long...?

509
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:53,878
Now, Uzumaki...
Don't be so disappointed.

510
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,131
So what should we do, Lady Hokage?

511
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,675
Shizune is heading up the autopsy...

512
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,094
It should be quicker than usual.

513
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,971
Still, we have no choice but to wait.

514
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,474
I'll go and make them speed it up.

515
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:10,144
Naruto! You get in Master Shizune's
way, and I'll give you a beating!

516
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,314
I will avenge Pervy Sage!

517
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:23,115
I can't just sit around doing nothing!

518
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:26,118
But Naruto-boy...

519
00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:31,219
Even if we decoded the message,
it has nothing to do with you.

520
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,668
Just what do you mean by that?!

521
00:37:34,243 --> 00:37:38,413
In any case, at this point,
you couldn't beat Pain.

522
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:39,840
What?!

523
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:43,906
Tell me. Even Jiraiya-boy
couldn't beat this opponent.

524
00:37:43,931 --> 00:37:45,933
Are you saying you're confident
you can?

525
00:37:47,756 --> 00:37:48,757
Well...

526
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,353
Being asked to come was
quite opportune.

527
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:57,608
I was planning on coming
to get you, Naruto-boy.

528
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,903
I am just as mortified...

529
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:05,866
I, too, want to avenge the death
of my student Jiraiya-boy.

530
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:10,413
I believe that the only one who
can do that is you, Naruto-boy.

531
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,290
Me...?

532
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,959
You want to avenge Jiraiya-boy,
don't you?

533
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,881
Of course I do!

534
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:18,879
Then come with me.

535
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:21,882
I'll train you in Sage Jutsu
at Mount Myoboku.

536
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,593
Everything that I drove
into Jiraiya-boy,

537
00:38:24,618 --> 00:38:26,996
I will do the same with you.

538
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:30,099
Will it let me win against Pain?!

539
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,767
That I can't guarantee.

540
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,394
It all depends on you, Naruto-boy.

541
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,064
Is that fine with you, Tsunade?

542
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,441
Of course...

543
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:39,772
Naruto, go.

544
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:44,155
Sage Jutsu training is more rigorous
than you can ever imagine.

545
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,448
Are you up to it?

546
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,117
Pervy Sage did it, right?

547
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,871
Then I can't lose to him! I'll do it!

548
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:56,083
<i>An entrusted student...
The Child of Prophecy.</i>

549
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:58,836
Nicely said!

550
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,553
Then, let us go.

551
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,930
Naruto-boy, say your goodbyes.

552
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,390
I'm off.

553
00:39:11,903 --> 00:39:14,072
I'm counting on you with
the code, Shikamaru.

554
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,020
Don't worry about us.

555
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:20,231
I will contact you the moment the results
of the autopsy and interrogation are in.

556
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:22,902
I will leave
the messenger frog behind.

557
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,779
If there's anything,
give it to him.

558
00:39:26,255 --> 00:39:27,006
Yes sir.

559
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,241
Good luck, Naruto!

560
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:30,659
Right!

561
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:33,120
All right! Let's go!

562
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:41,629
By the way,
which way is Mount Myoboku?

563
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,507
Can we really trust this guy?

564
00:39:44,899 --> 00:39:47,318
It takes a month to
get there on foot.

565
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,428
It's also known as
Maze Mountain.

566
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:52,748
If you don't know the secret route,
you won't be able to get there.

567
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:56,519
It's hard just to get there, eh?

568
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,687
Naruto-boy...

569
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,732
You already signed
a binding contract with us toads.

570
00:40:01,916 --> 00:40:03,710
There's no need to worry.

571
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,407
Hey! That's the...

572
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:12,118
Well then, I'll be borrowing this boy.

573
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,079
Please take care of him.

574
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:18,165
But what do you mean,
there's no need to worry?

575
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,376
He disappeared?

576
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,710
It's a Reverse Summoning.

577
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,379
Wow...

578
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,798
Good luck on your end too.

579
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:30,886
All right!

580
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:34,473
Let's concentrate on figuring
out the data Jiraiya left us.

581
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:36,434
Roger.

582
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,569
Where...are we?

583
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,281
Geezer Sage...
What is this place?

584
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,450
The Land of Toad.

585
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:53,576
The Land of Toad?

586
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,035
Naruto!

587
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:57,488
Gamakichi!

588
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:01,083
I summoned you here, Naruto.

589
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:04,003
I see...Is that how?

590
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:07,756
Before we train, we must eat.
Come along.

591
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,551
Food?!

592
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:20,603
Now, eat up! I went all out
to prepare this meal!

593
00:41:21,482 --> 00:41:23,651
Now, now...Don't be shy.

594
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,483
Try these caterpillars.

595
00:41:26,235 --> 00:41:28,112
Th-Thank you...

596
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,660
Now let's begin your training.

597
00:41:37,309 --> 00:41:38,310
Yes sir!

598
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,789
First of all, I must explain that

599
00:41:40,814 --> 00:41:45,527
what I'm about to teach you
is not ninjutsu, but Sage Jutsu.

600
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,755
Explain?

601
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:48,964
Listen well...

602
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:53,017
As opposed to ninjutsu, where
you utilize your own internal energy,

603
00:41:53,042 --> 00:41:56,379
Sage Jutsu involves taking in
outside energy for your use.

604
00:41:56,731 --> 00:41:58,607
Outside? What do you mean?

605
00:41:59,277 --> 00:42:00,799
As you're probably aware,

606
00:42:00,824 --> 00:42:07,914
ninjutsu utilizes chakra that is molded
from one's Mental and Physical Energy.

607
00:42:08,493 --> 00:42:12,655
Sage Jutsu involves
taking that internally generated chakra

608
00:42:12,851 --> 00:42:16,813
and adding Nature Energy
from the outside,

609
00:42:16,916 --> 00:42:19,835
resulting in an even
more powerful chakra.

610
00:42:20,127 --> 00:42:23,334
And that leads to all
your ninjutsu, genjutsu,

611
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,988
and even your taijutsu getting
a real power boost.

612
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:32,049
Mental and Physical Energy
within oneself,

613
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:34,468
and Nature Energy from the outside.

614
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:37,805
jutsu and techniques born
from the chakra

615
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:41,626
created by these three combined energies
is what's known as Sage jutsu.

616
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:43,769
Hmm...

617
00:42:44,669 --> 00:42:46,463
Look at it this way...

618
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:52,444
If you add mint flavor to chocolate-vanilla
ice cream, then it tastes even better.

619
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:54,846
That makes it more confusing, Gamakichi!

620
00:42:55,179 --> 00:42:56,680
Oh...I get it!

621
00:42:56,994 --> 00:42:58,954
You understood that analogy?

622
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,579
That's the kind of guy Naruto is.

623
00:43:02,172 --> 00:43:06,009
So what's this Nature Energy
really about?

624
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,319
Energy that is external to you.

625
00:43:08,344 --> 00:43:11,764
The energy that exists in
the atmosphere and the terrain.

626
00:43:12,393 --> 00:43:15,354
Atmosphere and terrain...Okay...

627
00:43:16,686 --> 00:43:18,855
As in, the air and in the ground.

628
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,347
Oh, is that what he meant?

629
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:25,227
Bah! Enough words. I will show you.

630
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,150
This should be good enough.

631
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:40,743
Wow! Lord Fukasaku is amazing!

632
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:43,245
Look at him gather all
that Nature Energy!

633
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:45,331
Where? Where?!

634
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,666
Oh, wow...

635
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,468
H-He lifted it!

636
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,845
How about that?

637
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:04,850
This is the power of
Nature Energy-enhanced Sage Jutsu.

638
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,567
But I don't know what you did...

639
00:44:13,725 --> 00:44:16,687
I only saw you weave a sign
at the beginning.

640
00:44:17,261 --> 00:44:19,013
Well, naturally.

641
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:23,879
Right now, you're not yet able
to sense Nature Energy, Naruto-boy.

642
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:28,832
So it's impossible for you to absorb it.

643
00:44:29,071 --> 00:44:30,364
Then how do I do it?

644
00:44:34,066 --> 00:44:36,818
You must become one with nature!

645
00:44:37,666 --> 00:44:38,792
Become one...?

646
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:42,054
As in, you have to die.

647
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,139
Die?!

648
00:44:45,387 --> 00:44:48,974
How come becoming one
with nature means dying?

649
00:44:49,476 --> 00:44:52,521
Gamakichi, what's with the dying?!

650
00:44:52,813 --> 00:44:54,356
Don't make such weird analogies!

651
00:44:55,285 --> 00:44:56,369
But...

652
00:44:57,514 --> 00:45:02,101
Relax. You're not actually
going to die, Naruto-boy.

653
00:45:02,494 --> 00:45:03,662
Then what?

654
00:45:04,081 --> 00:45:06,750
Just wait 'til I'm finished...

655
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,415
I'll explain it stepwise.

656
00:45:11,633 --> 00:45:15,637
Absorbing Nature Energy...

657
00:45:15,781 --> 00:45:21,145
It means the ability to sense it
around you and draw it into yourself.

658
00:45:21,916 --> 00:45:24,878
In addition,
by becoming one with nature,

659
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:30,561
you also gain full control over the Nature
Energy entering and leaving your body.

660
00:45:32,505 --> 00:45:36,009
Practically speaking,
in terms of your training...

661
00:45:36,034 --> 00:45:37,035
Yeah, yeah?

662
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:39,133
Sit still.

663
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,124
Huh?

664
00:45:40,393 --> 00:45:42,479
It means sit still!

665
00:45:43,076 --> 00:45:46,121
When you cease your flow
of animal instincts

666
00:45:46,146 --> 00:45:49,065
and harmonize with
the flow of nature,

667
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:51,620
you will be able to sense
Nature Energy for the first time.

668
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:55,002
So I just stay still?

669
00:45:55,439 --> 00:45:57,691
That seems easy enough.

670
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:01,508
Naruto, you really don't get it, do you?

671
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:08,599
For animals, not moving is
the hardest thing to do.

672
00:46:09,944 --> 00:46:13,573
Jumping, running, molding chakra
with all my strength...

673
00:46:13,894 --> 00:46:15,938
I've done those sorts of training.

674
00:46:16,226 --> 00:46:19,896
But staying still? I don't quite get it.

675
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:24,014
But that's how you take
in Nature Energy, right?

676
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,718
It's impossible to do it right away.

677
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:29,578
This training requires time,

678
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,372
since the degree of difficulty
is very high.

679
00:46:32,773 --> 00:46:34,692
It's gonna take that long?!

680
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,960
Don't take it so lightly, Naruto-boy!

681
00:46:37,367 --> 00:46:39,994
Our enemy is Pain,
who possesses the Rinnegan...

682
00:46:40,019 --> 00:46:41,854
The power of the
Sage of the Six Paths.

683
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:44,343
A powerful enemy
who killed Jiraiya-boy.

684
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,237
With that kind of attitude,
you can't possibly win!

685
00:46:49,262 --> 00:46:50,889
I know all that!

686
00:46:51,985 --> 00:46:54,612
Pain is the leader of the Akatsuki,
who are after Tailed Beasts.

687
00:46:54,841 --> 00:46:56,968
They could come for me
at any moment.

688
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:59,274
I don't have much time to waste.

689
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:08,700
Well, it's not as though
there isn't a better way...

690
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:10,160
There is?!

691
00:47:10,313 --> 00:47:11,982
Then teach me that!

692
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:15,858
This waterfall behind me...

693
00:47:16,671 --> 00:47:19,632
It's the secret toad oil
of Mount Myoboku.

694
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:20,796
Toad oil?

695
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:23,924
Come over here and
put out your hand.

696
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:32,595
Here.

697
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:40,399
This toad oil has the property
of attracting Nature Energy.

698
00:47:40,999 --> 00:47:43,001
It helps with the training.

699
00:47:43,468 --> 00:47:45,720
Hey, that's useful!

700
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:49,616
Whenever you rub this oil
on your body,

701
00:47:49,757 --> 00:47:53,427
Nature Energy can enter
through there.

702
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:58,876
And gradually, you'll gain the ability
to sense Nature Energy.

703
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:00,669
You're right...

704
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:03,171
I think I feel something
through my skin.

705
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:07,342
It is a tool to help grasp
the concept.

706
00:48:08,042 --> 00:48:11,879
In time, you won't even need
to use the oil.

707
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:14,558
However, there is a risk.

708
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:22,281
When used by one who is inexperienced
in controlling Nature Energy,

709
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,760
you start to turn into a frog.

710
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,659
Wh-Wh-What the hell is this?!

711
00:48:34,377 --> 00:48:35,378
Help!

712
00:48:35,403 --> 00:48:36,571
I don't wanna be a frog!

713
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,043
Oww!

714
00:48:41,505 --> 00:48:42,673
What's the big idea?

715
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,231
I'm back to normal.

716
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,591
It's all about balance.

717
00:48:47,618 --> 00:48:50,370
You're used to turning your Mental
and Physical Energy

718
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:53,196
into ninjutsu chakra,

719
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:55,223
so you've got a balance there.

720
00:48:56,372 --> 00:48:59,876
But now, you must add
Nature Energy into the mix.

721
00:48:59,901 --> 00:49:02,237
Getting the perfect balance
is extremely difficult.

722
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:04,066
Balance, huh?

723
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:08,153
Take in too little, and you won't
get Sage Jutsu chakra.

724
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,197
And yet, if you take in too much,

725
00:49:10,222 --> 00:49:13,684
Nature Energy will overwhelm you
and turn you into a frog.

726
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:20,040
Of course, if you only take in
a little too much, it's reversible.

727
00:49:21,182 --> 00:49:26,855
But get beyond a certain amount,
and you'll stay as a frog,

728
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:29,424
never reverting back to
a human again.

729
00:49:31,291 --> 00:49:33,084
What I meant about you
having to die

730
00:49:33,109 --> 00:49:35,778
is that you might stop being human.

731
00:49:36,051 --> 00:49:38,011
Once you turn into a frog,

732
00:49:38,036 --> 00:49:40,955
then you progress further toward
permanently becoming one with nature.

733
00:49:41,184 --> 00:49:45,272
And the past students
who've failed in this training...

734
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,319
are those stone statues.

735
00:49:51,227 --> 00:49:52,353
All of them?

736
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,534
Well, don't fret too much.

737
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:59,287
You have me.

738
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:03,667
And this baton beats Nature Energy
out of one's body.

739
00:50:04,337 --> 00:50:07,340
If you start transforming into a frog,

740
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:11,174
I'll beat you thoroughly to reverse it.

741
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,886
Speaking truthfully,

742
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:18,974
even Jiraiya-boy wasn't able
to completely master this.

743
00:50:20,449 --> 00:50:23,659
When molding Sage Jutsu chakra,

744
00:50:23,684 --> 00:50:25,895
Jiraiya-boy always acquired
some frog features.

745
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,317
But he was among the skilled ones.

746
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:32,696
I doubt that you'd hesitate
after coming this far,

747
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:35,198
but let me ask you...

748
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:37,826
What will you do?

749
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:41,455
I'll do it!

750
00:50:42,396 --> 00:50:44,064
My Ninja Way...

751
00:50:44,669 --> 00:50:46,420
is the same as the Pervy Sage's!

752
00:50:55,033 --> 00:50:56,052
Oww!

753
00:50:57,471 --> 00:51:00,640
Tomorrow, I'm going to be bruised
and bleeding on the inside.

754
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:03,351
What? Giving up already?

755
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:08,574
Hey, I know a much better
training method.

756
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,025
What is it?

757
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:12,695
Use Shadow Clones for the training.

758
00:51:12,991 --> 00:51:15,827
They exponentially increase
my progress!

759
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:17,741
You have a point.

760
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:22,370
The experience of the Shadow Clones
reverts back to the original.

761
00:51:23,276 --> 00:51:26,154
But the reverse is also true...

762
00:51:26,179 --> 00:51:29,516
If a Shadow Clone completely
changes into a frog,

763
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,838
it's over for the original.

764
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,007
I know that already.

765
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:36,676
Very well. But four is the limit!

766
00:51:36,992 --> 00:51:39,661
Any more and neither the baton
or I can keep up!

767
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:40,889
All right!

768
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,945
We're not playing a game
of whack-a-mole!

769
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:56,279
This is training!

770
00:51:56,364 --> 00:51:58,033
I'm not gonna last doing this!

771
00:51:58,206 --> 00:51:59,582
Damn!

772
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,244
Oww!

773
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:06,706
My face is like this from being hit!

774
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,792
I'm not turning into a frog!

775
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:10,585
What?! Sorry.

776
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:18,510
I never thought that training
to feel Nature Energy

777
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:21,054
would be so hard.

778
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:25,684
Only through perseverance shall
true strength be gained.

779
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,644
I know that!

780
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:30,438
If it'll make me strong like
the Pervy Sage,

781
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:32,440
anyone would endure this.

782
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:34,609
No...That's impossible.

783
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:39,739
This training is not for everyone...

784
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:45,245
You could say it's only possible
because it's you and Jiraiya-boy.

785
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,290
Or else I wouldn't have even
brought you here.

786
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:50,750
What do you mean?

787
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:55,338
Unless you already possess
enormous chakra inside you,

788
00:52:55,658 --> 00:53:00,246
Nature Energy would just take
over you right away.

789
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:04,514
That is how intense Nature Energy is.

790
00:53:06,231 --> 00:53:10,360
Plus, they must have the guts
to never give up.

791
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:13,706
That's the kind of person who
can become a Sage.

792
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:18,612
All right! Let's do this then!

793
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:21,072
Fool! Do you want to kill yourself?!

794
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:47,891
I can see it!

795
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:51,915
- Yes!
<i>- It seems he's starting</i>

796
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:54,543
- I can see it! I can see it!
<i>- to get the feel of Nature Energy.</i>

797
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:58,777
- Lord Fukasaku, I'm getting hungry.
- I saw it! I saw it!

798
00:53:58,826 --> 00:54:00,119
- You're right.
- I saw it!

799
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:03,114
- Naruto-boy, time for a break.
- I'm awesome, yeah!

800
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:04,157
Let's eat.

801
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:07,410
Eat up now.

802
00:54:08,586 --> 00:54:09,926
After the break,

803
00:54:09,951 --> 00:54:12,829
I'll have you try to lift up
the stone frogs using Sage Jutsu.

804
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,543
Y-Yes sir!

805
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:20,757
Good, huh?
They're Ma's special dishes.

806
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:23,385
They're all favorites of mine.

807
00:54:24,472 --> 00:54:26,433
<i>That actually tasted quite good.</i>

808
00:54:28,757 --> 00:54:30,926
<i>I'm becoming less human, after all.</i>

809
00:54:31,563 --> 00:54:35,108
Now then, I want you to
raise the stone frog.

810
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:39,985
But first, try it using only
your ninjutsu chakra.

811
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:41,319
O-Okay.

812
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:46,491
All right!

813
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,997
I can't lift it!

814
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:53,581
All right, stop!

815
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:01,214
Now, mold some Sage Jutsu chakra!

816
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:02,382
Right!

817
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:29,576
Good! Now try lifting
the stone frog once more!

818
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:31,619
Okay!

819
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:40,146
Oh!

820
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:47,969
That's it! Naruto-boy!

821
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:57,004
Nice, Naruto!

822
00:55:57,437 --> 00:56:01,399
<i>This lad's quicker on
the uptake than Jiraiya-boy.</i>

823
00:56:01,973 --> 00:56:03,099
I did it!

824
00:56:03,124 --> 00:56:05,710
Fool! How dare you treat your predecessor
with such disrespect!

825
00:56:11,308 --> 00:56:14,353
<i>Though he's a lot denser
than Jiraiya-boy too...</i>

826
00:56:15,187 --> 00:56:16,563
All right, Naruto-boy!

827
00:56:16,588 --> 00:56:19,457
Now put all the toppled stones
back in place!

828
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,419
Are you serious?!

829
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:27,342
It appears you've mastered
toad oil assisted control.

830
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:33,348
Now you need to master controlling
Nature Energy without using the oil.

831
00:56:37,524 --> 00:56:39,192
I can feel the power flowing into me!

832
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:45,026
ninjutsu chakra consumes
your internal energy.

833
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:47,695
The more you use it,
the more exhausted you will become.

834
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:52,327
In contrast, Sage Jutsu chakra
draws in external energy,

835
00:56:52,352 --> 00:56:54,270
so it will not tire you.

836
00:56:54,754 --> 00:56:57,715
In fact, you will recover and
heal quicker too.

837
00:56:59,127 --> 00:57:00,128
I get it...

838
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:03,670
<i>Well...With the Nine-Tails' chakra
in the mix too,</i>

839
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:05,839
<i>he's showing a truly remarkable
recovery rate.</i>

840
00:57:07,411 --> 00:57:10,623
Now maybe I can do that too...

841
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:11,928
Do what?

842
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,721
Huh?! Oh, nothing...

843
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:14,889
Nothing at all!

844
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:18,059
Never mind then...But here.

845
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:22,147
I thought I'd give you
this today, Naruto-boy.

846
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,065
What is it?

847
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:25,567
A book.

848
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:26,609
Book?

849
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:30,613
This is the first novel
Jiraiya-boy wrote.

850
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:34,742
A lot of Jiraiya-boy's mind and
heart are contained within it.

851
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:36,661
You should read it.

852
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:45,278
Tales of... a Gutsy Ninja.

853
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:51,426
Why don't you give it up?

854
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:59,392
This game of tag is getting boring.

855
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,616
Give it up.

856
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:16,451
Can I say one thing?

857
00:58:16,766 --> 00:58:18,058
I don't care to listen!

858
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,413
Die already!

859
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,832
Give up...

860
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:26,503
on me giving up!

861
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:32,091
Even if you bring me down,

862
00:58:32,372 --> 00:58:36,293
another assassin will attack
the village...

863
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:43,681
As long as we are cursed to
live in this ninja World,

864
00:58:43,706 --> 00:58:45,791
there will be no peace.

865
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:50,318
Then...I'll break that curse!

866
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:55,198
If there is such a thing as peace,
I'll seize it!

867
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:56,991
I'll never give up!

868
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:02,580
Wh-Who are you...?

869
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:04,499
My name is...

870
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:40,743
With so few people,
it sure is taking a while.

871
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:41,953
<i>Shut up!</i>

872
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:44,038
<i>Be quiet and focus.</i>

873
00:59:56,921 --> 00:59:58,477
It appears...

874
00:59:58,502 --> 01:00:00,879
Sasuke has blundered.

875
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:08,646
An octopus leg!

876
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:09,731
<i>Quit laughing!</i>

877
01:00:27,316 --> 01:00:28,487
Ow!

878
01:00:31,739 --> 01:00:32,781
Owww...

879
01:00:32,806 --> 01:00:34,600
Focus!

880
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:36,716
Though it's just a little,
your body is moving!

881
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:39,344
Don't forget, "stay still"!

882
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:45,308
Doing this without using the oil
is a lot harder than I thought.

883
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:47,352
Of course it is!

884
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:50,730
Don't expect it'll be so easy
when you don't use the oil!

885
01:00:55,731 --> 01:00:57,692
Not even the slightest quiver!

886
01:00:58,172 --> 01:01:00,633
Say, I was just thinking...

887
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:01,991
What is it?

888
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:05,620
Why can't I just take this oil
with me when I fight?

889
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,848
Then I won't need to learn

890
01:01:07,873 --> 01:01:10,376
how to take in Nature Energy
without the oil.

891
01:01:11,075 --> 01:01:12,326
That is impossible.

892
01:01:12,635 --> 01:01:14,261
Huh? Why?

893
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:20,051
Outside of Mount Myoboku's climate,
this oil vaporizes immediately.

894
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:22,387
No kidding?!

895
01:01:23,105 --> 01:01:24,879
I thought I told you.

896
01:01:24,904 --> 01:01:27,585
The oil is only to help you
grasp the concept.

897
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,062
Yes, sir!

898
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:34,382
But the way you change
into a frog so quickly...

899
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,984
Naruto-boy, you lack concentration!

900
01:01:38,257 --> 01:01:39,758
You're not taking it
seriously enough!

901
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,797
No, that's not true.

902
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:44,951
After all, I did get the knack of
this thing from the previous training.

903
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:47,495
Enough! Just follow me!

904
01:02:00,686 --> 01:02:03,564
Hey...This isn't what
I'm thinking, is it?

905
01:02:04,028 --> 01:02:07,657
It's exactly that.
This is your next training site.

906
01:02:08,868 --> 01:02:12,663
Stack a stone slab atop that summit
and begin Zen meditation.

907
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:15,421
If your concentration wavers
and you move even slightly,

908
01:02:15,446 --> 01:02:18,199
you will fall to the bottom
of the ravine.

909
01:02:18,544 --> 01:02:20,338
F-From up there?

910
01:02:27,914 --> 01:02:30,249
Hmm...This should do.

911
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:32,959
Follow me, Naruto-boy!

912
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:45,973
Stay still!

913
01:02:45,998 --> 01:02:48,500
You must learn to stop
your motion as an animal.

914
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:52,602
Find your own center of balance,

915
01:02:52,689 --> 01:02:55,359
and motionlessly synchronize
with nature!

916
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:07,784
S-Saved.

917
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:10,480
Taking in Nature Energy
will have to wait

918
01:03:10,505 --> 01:03:12,465
until you first perfect staying still.

919
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:20,963
No way!

920
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:25,802
Oww...

921
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:31,849
Maybe it's time for a break.

922
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:36,813
Damn...

923
01:03:37,191 --> 01:03:40,278
It's this hard just to stay still...

924
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:43,486
Isn't this training sorta ridiculous?

925
01:03:43,988 --> 01:03:45,531
Such nonsense!

926
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:50,326
Your master, Jiraiya-boy,
managed this feat.

927
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:55,331
Huh? Don't tell me...
Pervy Sage trained here too?

928
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:00,091
Yes. He and I came here often.

929
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:04,799
Say, how long did Pervy Sage
take on this training?

930
01:04:05,537 --> 01:04:11,835
Well, Jiraiya-boy came here to
train between missions,

931
01:04:12,747 --> 01:04:15,708
so it took him some time...

932
01:04:16,063 --> 01:04:17,148
I see.

933
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:20,024
Naruto-boy?

934
01:04:20,703 --> 01:04:22,079
<i>Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

935
01:04:22,427 --> 01:04:24,053
I don't have the luxury of time.

936
01:04:24,156 --> 01:04:26,241
So I have to pick up the pace!

937
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:29,073
Pervy Sage did the same training!

938
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:30,950
So I've gotta do my best too!

939
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:47,800
It's no good...

940
01:04:48,244 --> 01:04:50,955
Focus, Naruto-boy!

941
01:05:04,151 --> 01:05:06,404
That's pretty colorful
and yummy looking.

942
01:05:06,876 --> 01:05:09,253
Oh, would you like one, Naruto-boy?

943
01:05:09,944 --> 01:05:12,863
It's my favorite, larva riceballs.

944
01:05:13,126 --> 01:05:15,212
No thanks!

945
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:23,252
Oh no!

946
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:29,008
Oh...

947
01:06:08,876 --> 01:06:13,213
<i>It's looking good.
He's rapidly amassing Nature Energy.</i>

948
01:06:33,242 --> 01:06:35,620
<i>He's finally got it!</i>

949
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:39,370
<i>I'm impressed at how far
he's gotten without using the oil.</i>

950
01:06:52,641 --> 01:06:55,977
<i>He's displaying the rings around
the eyes. Proof of Sagehood.</i>

951
01:06:56,233 --> 01:06:58,610
<i>And no frog aspects either!</i>

952
01:06:59,564 --> 01:07:04,386
<i>This might mean Naruto-boy has
become a Sage, surpassing Jiraiya-boy!</i>

953
01:07:05,459 --> 01:07:08,045
<i>And it seems he's able to build up</i>

954
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:11,407
<i>even more Sage Jutsu chakra
than when he was using the oil.</i>

955
01:07:12,129 --> 01:07:13,631
How does it feel?

956
01:07:13,999 --> 01:07:18,420
Hmm...Now I kinda get what it means
to become one with nature.

957
01:07:33,497 --> 01:07:35,893
Owwww...

958
01:07:35,918 --> 01:07:38,481
Huh? It doesn't hurt that much...

959
01:07:41,673 --> 01:07:43,842
And that is Sage Mode!

960
01:07:44,435 --> 01:07:47,271
Your body has been activated
on many levels.

961
01:07:47,614 --> 01:07:50,575
W-Wow! Sage Mode, huh?!

962
01:07:50,983 --> 01:07:54,487
Now that you've mastered
Sage Mode,

963
01:07:54,528 --> 01:07:56,197
we've come to the final step.

964
01:07:56,947 --> 01:08:01,327
What?! Final step?
You mean there's more?!

965
01:08:02,295 --> 01:08:04,047
It's a type of sparring

966
01:08:04,072 --> 01:08:06,157
that Sages perform using
Sage Jutsu chakra.

967
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:10,127
Now I shall teach you
how to do Frog Kumite!

968
01:08:43,869 --> 01:08:46,539
Naruto-boy, let's call it a day.

969
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:50,876
No, not yet!

970
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:53,337
I'm the one that can't go on.

971
01:08:53,437 --> 01:08:57,066
However...you're starting to
get the hang of it.

972
01:08:59,458 --> 01:09:00,252
Yes, sir!

973
01:09:39,034 --> 01:09:41,536
I pulled it off!

974
01:09:49,178 --> 01:09:52,347
Even though it's far from perfect...

975
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:55,107
I need more practice while
in Sage Mode.

976
01:09:55,816 --> 01:09:59,153
And, I have to make sure
no one sees me.

977
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:13,834
Well then...

978
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:20,925
I'm going to procure us
some fresh ingredients.

979
01:10:22,024 --> 01:10:25,986
<i>Not more of that gross stuff...
Aw man...</i>

980
01:10:26,865 --> 01:10:30,327
Ma! Make sure you get
some stamina-building stuff!

981
01:10:40,170 --> 01:10:43,257
You are able to mold
Sage Jutsu chakra

982
01:10:43,341 --> 01:10:47,137
and have pretty much mastered
Frog Kumite and Sage Techniques.

983
01:10:47,933 --> 01:10:50,811
Now I have one final thing
to say to you.

984
01:10:51,570 --> 01:10:54,364
Wh-What is it?
You're suddenly so serious.

985
01:10:55,306 --> 01:10:59,644
Well...It's about the risks of
using Sage Mode.

986
01:11:00,966 --> 01:11:02,009
Risks?

987
01:11:02,296 --> 01:11:06,216
Yes...Once you fully grasp
the risks involved,

988
01:11:06,241 --> 01:11:09,202
then you can use Sage Mode
to its fullest extent!

989
01:11:09,448 --> 01:11:12,409
So, what are the risks?

990
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:16,397
First, as you're probably aware,

991
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:19,275
you can't maintain
Sage Mode for too long.

992
01:11:19,566 --> 01:11:21,193
Maybe five minutes at most.

993
01:11:22,089 --> 01:11:26,301
Also, to amass the Nature Energy
necessary to enter Sage Mode,

994
01:11:26,610 --> 01:11:28,487
you must follow the principle
of staying still.

995
01:11:28,842 --> 01:11:32,095
Thus, it cannot be used
once you begin battle.

996
01:11:32,851 --> 01:11:36,021
For when you are still, you become
an easy target for your enemy.

997
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:37,584
<i>Ow!</i>

998
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:39,461
I see...

999
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:40,671
Right?

1000
01:11:41,070 --> 01:11:43,197
So the only time you can go
into Sage Mode is

1001
01:11:43,222 --> 01:11:47,219
when you've got plenty of comrades
around you that can free you up.

1002
01:11:48,534 --> 01:11:53,455
If you are alone,
but must go into Sage Mode,

1003
01:11:53,517 --> 01:11:58,314
withdraw from the battle momentarily
and gather Nature Energy.

1004
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:02,386
What?! Then Sage Mode is useless!

1005
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:04,903
So what was all this training for?!

1006
01:12:05,529 --> 01:12:07,197
Don't be so disappointed.

1007
01:12:07,326 --> 01:12:10,955
That is why I am here,
to alleviate that risk.

1008
01:12:11,815 --> 01:12:13,316
What do you mean?

1009
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:18,834
If you and I merge our bodies,
it'll be fine!

1010
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:25,924
No!!

1011
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:27,593
When I say merge,

1012
01:12:27,634 --> 01:12:31,555
it simply means to be lightly
attached to your shoulder or back.

1013
01:12:34,933 --> 01:12:36,769
Oh, that's all...

1014
01:12:37,102 --> 01:12:40,022
But how does merging
make things fine?

1015
01:12:40,647 --> 01:12:45,277
Simply put, it's to split
the roles of stillness and action.

1016
01:12:45,339 --> 01:12:47,216
When one is moving,

1017
01:12:47,241 --> 01:12:50,244
the other stays still and
gathers Nature Energy.

1018
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:54,870
In Jiraiya-boy's case,
the final form of his Sage Mode

1019
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:57,414
had Ma and me both
riding his shoulders.

1020
01:12:58,248 --> 01:13:00,667
I see...I get it now...

1021
01:13:01,293 --> 01:13:04,254
Don't you worry, Naruto-boy!

1022
01:13:05,005 --> 01:13:06,090
Okay!

1023
01:13:21,168 --> 01:13:22,878
A genjutsu block...

1024
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:33,909
I'm going to take a peek into your mind.

1025
01:13:39,456 --> 01:13:41,875
<i>So many genjutsu blocks...</i>

1026
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:45,129
<i>No wonder truth serum
didn't work on him.</i>

1027
01:13:50,137 --> 01:13:51,180
How did it go?

1028
01:13:51,853 --> 01:13:52,896
It's no use...

1029
01:13:53,222 --> 01:13:55,849
Someone's placed blocks
inside his mind.

1030
01:13:56,923 --> 01:13:59,050
It's going to be difficult to
navigate past them.

1031
01:14:00,639 --> 01:14:04,309
It's probably some jutsu placed
on him by the one named Pain.

1032
01:14:05,092 --> 01:14:06,635
Please be careful, Inoichi.

1033
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:10,487
There may be genjutsu traps
set in there as well.

1034
01:14:11,658 --> 01:14:13,118
Yes, I'm aware of that.

1035
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:34,386
<i>These black rods, which
were embedded in the corpse...</i>

1036
01:14:34,386 --> 01:14:36,805
<i>Could they be a special feature
of these men known as Pain?</i>

1037
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:52,905
<i>Why did they embed this
into the body?</i>

1038
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:54,887
<i>I must learn more about</i>

1039
01:14:54,912 --> 01:14:57,206
<i>the properties of this metal
before the autopsy.</i>

1040
01:14:59,791 --> 01:15:02,418
"The-Real-One's-Not-Among-Them."

1041
01:15:03,615 --> 01:15:07,118
Maybe the six Pains were genjutsu...

1042
01:15:07,325 --> 01:15:10,787
A jutsu created by the female Akatsuki
member who was also said to be present.

1043
01:15:11,198 --> 01:15:14,551
And she's the one who physically
attacked Lord Jiraiya from the shadows.

1044
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:16,970
No...That's hard to imagine.

1045
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:20,641
According to Lord Fukasaku,

1046
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:25,020
Lord Jiraiya died from being stabbed by
real weapons wielded by all six of them.

1047
01:15:27,546 --> 01:15:29,923
Well, he took down three of them,

1048
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:31,944
but they supposedly
resurrected themselves...

1049
01:15:32,343 --> 01:15:34,804
It does sound like some
unbelievable genjutsu.

1050
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:38,951
Common sense has no meaning
when it comes to the Akatsuki.

1051
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:41,620
There have been others
who were immortal.

1052
01:15:42,661 --> 01:15:46,665
In any case, let's keep hypothesizing
all possible scenarios

1053
01:15:46,833 --> 01:15:48,919
until we get reports from the others.

1054
01:15:49,526 --> 01:15:50,527
You're right.

1055
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:53,901
Let's at least be a little closer
to solving Pain's mystery

1056
01:15:53,926 --> 01:15:55,928
by the time Naruto returns
from his training.

1057
01:16:04,142 --> 01:16:06,228
So here you are.

1058
01:16:11,191 --> 01:16:14,778
Naruto-boy, every once in
a while, you disappear.

1059
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:16,029
Where do you go?

1060
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:20,158
Well...nowhere in particular.
I just wander around...

1061
01:16:20,617 --> 01:16:21,743
Well, no matter.

1062
01:16:22,452 --> 01:16:26,748
I want to practice merging starting now,
so come down here.

1063
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:31,503
All right! This completes
the steps to Sage Mode...

1064
01:16:31,631 --> 01:16:33,424
We'll now begin the merge training!

1065
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:35,048
Y-Yeah...!

1066
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:39,803
So basically, you're gonna get
on my shoulder, right?

1067
01:16:40,095 --> 01:16:41,096
Correct.

1068
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:48,604
While you move,
I draw in Nature Energy.

1069
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:51,773
This is a training to hone
that combination.

1070
01:16:53,431 --> 01:16:56,643
Now then, let us synchronize
our breathing.

1071
01:16:57,865 --> 01:16:58,693
Okay...

1072
01:17:04,703 --> 01:17:07,414
<i>Sage Art: Amphibian Jutsu!</i>

1073
01:17:37,203 --> 01:17:40,039
It seems this is not possible.

1074
01:17:40,792 --> 01:17:41,876
Not possible...?!

1075
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:48,246
I suspect that the Nine-Tails
inside you is rejecting me.

1076
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:50,745
No way!

1077
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:53,335
Then what was all that training for?!

1078
01:17:53,477 --> 01:17:54,978
What are we gonna do?!

1079
01:17:56,278 --> 01:17:59,031
If we can't merge,
I have no choice

1080
01:17:59,056 --> 01:18:01,350
but to pull in Nature Energy
while I'm moving!

1081
01:18:01,968 --> 01:18:04,388
And I said that's impossible!

1082
01:18:04,721 --> 01:18:08,141
I never imagined this would
happen after coming this far.

1083
01:18:10,323 --> 01:18:11,950
I'm not giving up!

1084
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:14,896
If that's what it takes,
then I'll keep at it until it works!

1085
01:18:15,315 --> 01:18:18,068
But I'm saying it's impossible!

1086
01:18:20,654 --> 01:18:22,155
I-I'm sorry...

1087
01:18:23,019 --> 01:18:27,607
I know this is hard to accept,
but it's physically impossible.

1088
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:34,835
That code on your back was a message
to me from the Pervy Sage.

1089
01:18:35,836 --> 01:18:37,713
Yes, I know that.

1090
01:18:38,202 --> 01:18:40,371
And thanks to you, Naruto-boy,

1091
01:18:40,396 --> 01:18:42,052
it's become a key to solving
the mystery of Pain--

1092
01:18:42,077 --> 01:18:43,078
Not just that.

1093
01:18:44,636 --> 01:18:49,766
It's also a message for me not to
give up until the very end.

1094
01:18:50,291 --> 01:18:52,043
But still...

1095
01:18:55,272 --> 01:18:57,149
I'm Pervy Sage's student.

1096
01:18:58,024 --> 01:19:01,695
And if that message was
my master's Ninja Way... then I...

1097
01:19:03,613 --> 01:19:06,408
I have no business whining!

1098
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:14,166
Oww!

1099
01:19:17,919 --> 01:19:19,045
Not just yet!

1100
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:20,672
Let's keep on going!

1101
01:19:24,596 --> 01:19:27,766
He's so stubborn...

1102
01:19:29,113 --> 01:19:31,616
Let's take a break, Naruto-boy.

1103
01:19:32,189 --> 01:19:34,275
Otherwise, I won't be able
to keep up.

1104
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:38,087
That's no good!
We have to keep going to make up

1105
01:19:38,112 --> 01:19:40,447
for the time we spent on
the training up until now!

1106
01:19:41,142 --> 01:19:45,688
Look, you've never had this kind
of training before.

1107
01:19:46,736 --> 01:19:49,597
To run and gather Nature Energy,

1108
01:19:49,622 --> 01:19:51,749
for which the foundation
is being still,

1109
01:19:51,977 --> 01:19:56,314
is like telling you to look to the left,
when you are looking to the right.

1110
01:20:02,662 --> 01:20:03,663
What is it?

1111
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:36,498
That's about it...

1112
01:20:39,733 --> 01:20:40,984
Scouting complete.

1113
01:20:41,044 --> 01:20:42,796
Same as usual,
nothing suspicious.

1114
01:20:47,213 --> 01:20:49,132
It's another nice day.

1115
01:20:52,138 --> 01:20:55,016
Granny, hurry! Hurry!

1116
01:20:55,729 --> 01:20:58,607
Now, now. Don't be so hasty.

1117
01:21:08,486 --> 01:21:11,281
A stick of this after a mission...

1118
01:21:11,306 --> 01:21:12,766
This is what I live for.

1119
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:35,891
C'mon, hurry and pick a card.

1120
01:21:40,265 --> 01:21:41,104
<i>Byakugan!</i>

1121
01:21:41,296 --> 01:21:43,507
H-Hey! No fair!

1122
01:21:43,533 --> 01:21:45,827
You can't use Byakugan
in a game!

1123
01:21:54,444 --> 01:21:57,864
Well, I guess I'll start on
the next report that's due.

1124
01:22:08,558 --> 01:22:10,518
<i>Is he from...the Akatsuki?!</i>

1125
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:23,538
<i>Right! Must report this
to Lady Hokage!</i>

1126
01:22:26,568 --> 01:22:27,569
What?!

1127
01:22:56,846 --> 01:22:58,264
The time has come.
